＠Da Vinci
Except we didn't eliminate it.[sr]It only appeared that way.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You see, that was among the most powerful kind of demonic beasts, a Phantasmal that is perhaps even stronger than dragonkin.

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
I knew it... So that indeed was a sphinx. A divine beast from ancient Egypt that has a man's face and a lion's body.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
Yeah. That damage we just inflicted was nothing more than a yawn to such a creature. It'll recover in the blink of an eye.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Let's get out of here. It's too tough to go up against a sphinx by ourselves.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
But where can we go? I wish we could get some kind of data from the Doctor about this area...

＠Da Vinci
Oh, we don't have to worry about that. Scanning the area is just a piece of cake for me, you know...

...All right, I've found a source of water to the west of here. Not only that, it seems there's a city there.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Let's go there first.[sr]You need to rest too, right, [%1]?
[k]

？1：Water sounds really good now...

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes. I agree with you, Senpai.[sr]Let's look for some cold water!
[k]

？2：I can keep going.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
No, Senpai. Your lips are all chapped, and you're looking very pale.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
We should do as Da Vinci suggested, and head for that water source.
