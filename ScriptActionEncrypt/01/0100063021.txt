＠Tristan
...How sad. To miss your mark, despite possessing all of that skill...
[k]

＠Tristan
Certainly, you have improved. You are no longer one I can kill with minimal effort.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Tristan
However, the same can be said for you. You cannot kill me if I am focused on defense.
[k]

＠Tristan
This is what you call a stalemate. Ahhh... This is exactly why I am so sad...
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Tristan
On this occasion, time is on my side. All I have to do is toy with you people here.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Tristan
That alone will accomplish the Lion King's ambition. Ah, so boring, so difficult to bear.
[k]

I did not imagine a silly ending like this awaited... This is but a tragedy...

He's making shallow attacks. At this rate, neither side will score a winning hit.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...The first time I saw him, I had a hunch that this Archer falls under the category of "deplorable."
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

And it seems my intuition was right. He's being atrocious!

My apologies for making you wait, [%1]. I'm sure we have much to discuss, especially the fierce battles up to now...

But at the moment, we are in a race against time. Please, go on ahead.

This man is our prey. By the pride of the Old Man of the Mountain, I swear we will take his life.

Why the look of concern? Get going. We are, together, Old Men of the Mountain. We don't fight if there's no way to win.

We've researched Tristan's history. We'll easily kill him, then hunt for the Lion King's head.

＠Cursed Arm
Once, there was a king that, though an enemy, called our hero a knight and praised him...
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
You remind me very much of him. It seems chivalry is still alive and well.

Are you so absorbed in chatting with your friends? You insects who have come here to be exterminated?

I fear the cost for such boorishness is high. In fact I worry whether you can afford to pay it.

I am going to dismember and gut you while preserving your heads, so die not along the way.
