...Oh?
[k]

＠Jack the Ripper
You came out here.[sr]All right. Hehe...what should we do?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jack the Ripper
Should we kill you?[sr]One, two, three, lots. Lots.
[k]

＠Jack the Ripper
Hehe. We killed lots and lots,[sr]but we're still hungry. We're starving.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jack the Ripper
The police officers don't have much[sr]magical energy, you know.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jack the Ripper
So thanks for coming.[sr]We'll be full after we eat your magical energy.

No, I don't think we did.[sr]This smells of blood...the Yard's been wiped out, huh?

＠H：???
Yes. I'm a Caster Servant.[sr]I'm one of the leaders of the "Project" you know of.
[k]

？1：Project Demonic Fog?

？2：Why are you doing this?

？！

[charaFace H 1]
＠H：???
It's a complex set of circumstances, you see.[sr]Oh, please call me "P."

[charaFadein H 0 1]
＠"P"
Unfortunately, you're too late.[sr]Scotland Yard has been slaughtered to the last man.
[k]

＠"P"
They all died horribly.[sr]That girl has no compassion within her at all.
[k]

＠"P"
But it was necessary.[sr]A necessary sacrifice. That's all I can say.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠"P"
Man is to be loved.[sr]Love and emotions are both noble, brilliant things.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠"P"
But[line 3] How sad. Sometimes they[sr]pale in comparison to the greater good.
[k]

＠"P"
Something we need was kept[sr]inside Scotland Yard.
[k]

＠"P"
Figures the British Empire, home of the[sr]Mage's Association and the Clock Tower, would put a heavy magical seal on.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠"P"
And so, sadly,[sr]they were in the way of our greater good.

Why do you mouth off like you actually know stuff?[sr]I could care less about love and emotions!

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Yet again, you guys laid your hands on what's mine.[sr]You're no king. How dare you touch what belongs to a king!
[k]

？1：A Heroic Spirit, killing innocent people?

＠"P"
Yes, and so you see.[sr]I am so filled with sorrow I cannot control myself.
[k]

＠"P"
Humans, possessing emotion, should be sacred.[sr]Humans, filled with love, should be dazzling.
[k]

＠"P"
My power cannot save them.[sr]No, looking at the results, it could never save them.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠"P"
Time is being incinerated.[sr]Humanity is being incinerated.
[k]

＠"P"
The march of civilization, emotions, love, are all[sr]disappearing. Only four more singularities remain in the world.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠"P"
How sad.[sr]But neither you nor I can stop it.
[k]

＠"P"
No, if we could not stop it[line 3]

...I feel a contradiction.
[k]

＠Mash
A contradiction in your words when you speak of[sr]emotion. Caster, no, "P," who are you?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mash
You used Jack to take human lives.[sr]You're surely the one without compassion.

I am a mage, and a wicked and cruel one at that.[sr]Even now, I tell an innocent girl as follows:
