But do fear injury. As long as mankind fears death, it is natural to long for immortality and eternal youth.

But even so, you must press onward.

Arjuna, let me finish. It seems I've got a habit of not explaining myself.

I was never the talkative type, but in this situation,[sr]I don't want you to misunderstand me.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Karna
...Put simply, this is a competition.
[k]

＠Karna
Instead of fighting directly, we shall compete to see who can kill more of them. It'll be a hunting competition.
[k]

＠Karna
Yes, every kshatriya warrior remembers doing that.[sr]It is a fair competition that none shall find fault with.
[k]

＠Karna
...Yes. I know you hate me. And that is fine.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Karna
I am not a saint myself. If I am hated, I cannot help but sometimes be enraged.
[k]

＠Karna
But it is a righteous hate, and a righteous rage.[sr]It is nothing special.
[k]

＠Karna
And not being special does not mean it is evil.

＠Karna
Do not lie to yourself, Arjuna.[sr]You don't have to do that for us to fight side by side.
