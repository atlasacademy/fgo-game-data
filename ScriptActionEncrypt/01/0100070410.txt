＠Da Vinci
Okay, is that my cue?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Da Vinci
It's time for your circle setup mini-lecture.[sr]In this episode of magecraft trivia, we'll cover...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The Age of Gods and Divine Spirits. Since you're in the B.C. period known as the end of the Age of Gods, it's the perfect subject.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
I told you about Divine Spirits before, so this time, let's talk about the Age of Gods.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Mages call the magical energy that fills the atmosphere “mana.” The further back in time you go, the more of it there is.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Think of it as the magical energy of the Earth itself. It was not unlike an infinite supply of gasoline for humans.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
On the other hand, the individual magical energy possessed by a human or Heroic Spirit is called “od.”
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This magical energy comes from special nerve tissue called a magical circuit. Remember, though: The difference in scale between od in a human and the earth's mana is tremendous.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Da Vinci
Mana is a vast reservoir of energy, and od is just a tiny little drop.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And since the start of the A.D. era, the amount of mana has been steadily decreasing.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
As a result, in the 21st century, mages practice their Mystics using od alone.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Da Vinci
We'll skip over why there's less mana for now. It's got to do with the Isle of Britain, so I'm sure it'll come up eventually.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Anyway, in the Age of Gods, mana was everywhere.[sr]And there wasn't just more of it; it was more potent, too.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Mana in the A.D. era is called Ether, the Fifth Imaginary Element. It's artificial magical energy, you see.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Before the A.D. era, human civilization was still in development, and magical energy was called something else:
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Da Vinci
True Ether. The power that gave birth to planets and formed the stars. The True Fifth Element.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This True Ether is the root that forms the gods.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
It wasn't humans who ruled this era. It was the gods.[sr]Or, you could call them “nature” or “concepts” if you like.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Gods in the sky. Gods on the earth. Gods in the sea. Love was a god, hate was a god. Death and battle also had gods.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Da Vinci
The laws of nature were among the many Authorities wielded by the gods.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The world belonged to them. You could even say the gods formed many aspects of this world.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
There are differing opinions as to whether the gods spoken of in legends, faiths, and religions in the modern world are the same beings...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
But modern mages, at least, believe that many legends are interpretations of things that took place during the Age of Gods.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The gods truly existed. However...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Da Vinci
With the arrival of the Age of Man, they vanished.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
These disappearances came in three stages: decline, parting, and opportunity.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The “opportunity” phase took place around the 7th century B.C.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Da Vinci
A great disaster around 14,000 years ago supposedly caused prehistoric mythological civilizations to weaken, hence the “decline” phase.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
You're in 2600 B.C., the “parting” phase at the end of the Age of Gods, when gods and humans went their separate ways.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Mesopotamia is no exception. As it happens, the Mesopotamian gods came up with their own way...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...of trying to continue the Age of Gods, but a single king ruined their plans.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Da Vinci
A king created to bind man and the gods together. Part-man, part-god. The man they hoped would be the “Wedge of the Heavens.”
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Da Vinci
But instead, he chose a path opposite to the one the gods had laid out for him. He chose to distance himself from the gods.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
Gilgamesh's rebellion caused the gods of Mesopotamia to gradually lose their power, and in time they vanished from the surface of the earth.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Even in this era, the gods are gone.[sr]They've fulfilled their role and vanished.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The present theory is that they exist as hollow Divine Spirits on a higher plane, watching over the world.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The true gods have vanished from this world, leaving behind only shadows.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In a thousand years, those shadows will be gone, replaced in the minds of humans only by legends.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Da Vinci
That's why I thought you wouldn't run into any living gods. I was shocked to see you'd found an alliance of goddesses.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
From the data I just saw, Ishtar's Spirit Origin was extremely close to the real thing.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Da Vinci
A god's Authority is a Mystic far beyond magecraft.[sr]You could call it a manifestation of omnipotence.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
We're not sure who your true foe is in that era, but it's clear that the goddesses aren't on your side.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Da Vinci
Be careful, [%1].
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I know I'm wasting my time saying this, but don't do anything too crazy, okay?

No need to thank me. It is my duty as a Heroic Spirit.

...Good, good. Our circumstances may be different, but we're all working toward the same goal.

But, well, can I ask you something?[sr]It was King Gilgamesh who summoned you, right?

＠Benkei
Indeed. After Merlin, King Gilgamesh summoned seven of us Heroic Spirits to this land.
[k]

＠Benkei
...Now there are only four of us, but we'll talk about that another time.
[k]

＠Benkei
During the summoning, it was King Gilgamesh's magical energy that formed our Spirit Origins.
[k]

＠Benkei
But now we maintain our own sources of energy. We eat and sleep like humans, and generate magical energy all on our own.

Yes, he really went a bit crazy.[sr]I should never have told him about the Holy Grail War.
[k]

＠Merlin
Just supplying me with magical energy almost drained him dry. But then he says, “I'll summon seven more!”
[k]

＠Merlin
The reason King Gilgamesh isn't on the front lines fighting is partly because he still hasn't recovered all his magical energy.

So it seems. Before we were summoned, he said he didn't know who the enemy was.
[k]

＠Leonidas
The northern cities were wiped out by the Demonic Beasts, disasters occurred all over the land, and Kutha vanished overnight.
[k]

＠Leonidas
That's when King Gilgamesh said he “saw” the future. He saw a future where Uruk was destroyed and swallowed up into an abyss.

The pleasure is mine. Anyway, back to the timeline.
[k]

＠Leonidas
After this era became a Singularity, and humanity was incinerated, King Gilgamesh summoned us.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Six months later, Uruk was reborn into a fortress city.
[k]

＠Leonidas
We grow crops, train soldiers, and build structures within the fortress...
[k]

＠Leonidas
A monetary system was established purely as an emergency measure for the war, all while we struggle against this unknown enemy.
[k]

If what happened in America had come a few years later, they would've fought the Celts head-on.
[k]

＠Merlin
What was lucky for Uruk was that King Gilgamesh had come back “matured.”
[k]

＠Merlin
After he finished his search for immortality, he probably underwent a bit of a mental change.

King Gilgamesh's friend, a hero equal in stature... and now humanity's enemy.
[k]

＠Siduri
...But we just can't believe that's truly Enkidu.[sr]The Uruks knew the old Enkidu.
[k]

＠Siduri
Enkidu was the one who restrained King Gilgamesh, the king who was fated to be alone until death, and taught him the joys of friendship.
[k]

＠Siduri
Though they insisted they were simply a tool, to me, Enkidu seemed like nothing less than a very kind person.
[k]

＠Siduri
...The real Enkidu would never wear such a cruel smile on their face.
[k]

That THING that threatens Sumer now must be a fake only pretending to be Enkidu.

“Someone calling themselves Enkidu appeared? I see. Well, I suppose that's possible.”

The only reason Uruk is still standing at all is because of how hard the king is working.

If he ever abandoned the role of the wise king and became the King of Heroes again, Uruk would be doomed. I want to avoid that, too.
