＠Drake
There wasn't much difference in the ships' performance.[sr]The issue was the thickness of their armor.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Yes. Our cannons had no effect.[sr]...Doctor, please tell us about Blackbeard.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I have some knowledge,[sr]but I'm sure that Chaldea has more accurate data.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Right, Blackbeard was a pirate[sr]born 100 years after Francis Drake.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
His real name was Edward Teach.[sr]He was one of the pirates who ruled over the Caribbean.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
His policy was simple. He would kill anyone[sr]who showed resistance but spared the rest.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Based in Nassau, he rampaged through these waters on his beloved ship, from Virginia to Honduras.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
His beloved ship...[sr]It had a name, right?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yes. It was called "Queen Anne's Revenge."[sr]He had 300 men on board.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He built up a large fleet centered around his flagship,[sr]and reigned as one of the strongest and worst pirates.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
However, he ended up losing his head.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Even a pirate as fearsome as him...[sr]Unbelievable...
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
...Don't say any more.[sr]He's a Servant I'd rather not remember.

＠Drake
Yeah, pirates are all trashy, but he is the trashiest of[sr]them all. The King of Trash. That's what he is.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
Sorry, everybody.[sr]I apologize on behalf of all pirates.
[k]

？1：You're also a victim, Drake.

？2：I know how you feel.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
[%1]...[sr]You're a good [&guy:girl]... You'd be a great pirate!
[k]

＠Drake
As a pirate, I can guarantee it!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Doctor, are there any stories that could[sr]give us hints on his Noble Phantasm?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There are a few... Among them, I think his ship[sr]has the highest possibility of being a Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I was monitoring the magical energy levels during the battle, and his ship gave off the strongest readings.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Captain Drake's "Golden Hind" too. Maybe it's the Holy Grail, but it showed magical energy similar to a Noble Phantasm...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even then, that ship was superior...
[k]

＠Fou
Fou...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
Hmm... I don't quite understand,[sr]but are you saying that my ship is no match for his?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
[charaFadein A 0.1 2]
＠Mash
It seems that way...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
Hmmm...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Wait a second... Nothing happened before you[sr]blasted the ropes and made your escape?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Did you inflict any damage to their side[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Ah, at that time... I believe we defeated[sr]Eric Bloodaxe.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Right! Yes, we confirmed that he vanished[sr]completely on our end as well.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Ah, so that's it!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
What do you mean?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Simply put, Blackbeard's Noble Phantasm[line 2]is that ship, "Queen Anne's Revenge."
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Maybe it's a Noble Phantasm that powers up as[sr]"his subordinates get stronger and stronger."
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
!!!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The moment you guys defeated Eric, the magical[sr]energy surrounding the ship clearly weakened.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
After that, it stayed in that state until they lost sight of us.
[k]

＠Mash
In other words[line 2]the more Servants it carries,[sr]the stronger it becomes?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There were five Servants including Blackbeard on that[sr]ship. With Eric defeated, it's now four.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Maybe the reason he sought Euryale...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...is because he gets stronger with her on board.[sr]His personal interests also play a part, of course...
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
If only we could pull those Servants away somehow...[sr]But I'm sure it will be hard.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Ah, I've never encountered a hindrance like him before.[sr]He knows nothing and still disturbs our Holy Grail search!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
Well, we pirates are all like that. We take treasures[sr]from people, no matter how good they may be.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...If it's hard to pull them away, we'll have to slay them.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...And we better do it fast, before Blackbeard[sr]becomes even more powerful.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Offense is the best form of defense. Hmm?[sr]I'm picking up couple life signatures on that island.
