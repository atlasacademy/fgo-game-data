This time we're safe for sure. Let's head down[sr]while keeping an eye out for enemy soldiers.

United Roman Empire...[sr]They seem to have taken in Servants.

Who is the mastermind anyway?[sr]Is it Lev Lainur, or perhaps[line 2]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
I still can't pick up anything, but if there's a Servant here it'd be hard to avoid combat.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Servants are being implemented in wars[sr]without hesitation. This is clearly unusual.

＠Dr. Roman
If you weren't here, the emperor would've been killed for sure.

Please do your best, I'll proceed with my analysis.
[k]

？1：Understood.

？2：Do your best, Doctor.

I know you only just returned, but I'm thinking of launching an expedition to Gaul.
[k]

＠Nero
It's to aid and give encouragement to my fellow[sr]subordinates. Of course, if I don't go there's no point.

I'd like [%1] and Mash to join me.[sr]Well? Will you come?

＠Dr. Roman
The emperor's given me details of the situation. Gaul[sr]seems to be a front line in the war with the United Empire.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's a chance that the Servant with the Grail[sr]could be rampaging there. Lev could be there too.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I think you should go with her.[sr]Naturally, it'll be dangerous, but[line 2]
[k]

？1：It can't be helped.

？2：We'll do our best and be careful.
