＠David
Wait![sr]Before that, I have a question for Jason.
[k]

＠David
...Who gave you such an idiotic idea as sacrificing[sr]Euryale to the "Ark?"
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jason
That's none of your business!
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠David
Oh, I think it is. After all, if you had[sr]sacrificed her, the world would have been destroyed.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jason
[line 3]What?
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠David
Of course.[sr]That box brings death.
[k]

＠David
To offer it a Divine Spirit is completely insane.
[k]

＠David
This era is unstable to begin with.[sr]It would have killed the era itself.
[k]

＠Jason
[line 3]Ridiculous.[sr]Lies. That can't be[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠David
That's why I'm asking you.
[k]

＠David
"Sacrificing a Divine Spirit will grant infinite power."[sr]Who tempted you with that promise?
[k]

＠David
Was it Hektor? Medea?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jason
...Medea?[sr]He's lying... isn't he?

＠Jason
Sacrificing a Divine Spirit to the "Ark"[sr]would've grant me powers and invincibility, right?
[k]

＠Jason
I mean, that's what HE told me...
[k]

＠Medea Lily
It is no lie. After all, the death[sr]of an era brings complete destruction.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Medea Lily
If the world is destroyed, your enemies will cease to[sr]exist. See[line 2]? That makes you invincible, no?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jason
Y-you.[sr]You people lied to me?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jason
That doesn't serve my purpose at all![sr]I was finally going to create an ideal nation!
[k]

＠Jason
One where everyone respects me![sr]A true utopia, where all are content, and there is no war!
[k]

＠Jason
Was this trial not for that purpose!?[sr]Was it not to give me a second chance!?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Medea Lily
...That is a dream that can never come true, Lord Jason.[sr]It is beyond you.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Medea Lily
You'll never be an ideal king. Even if your heart truly[sr]wished for peace, your soul is hopelessly twisted.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
You cannot make your dream come true.[sr]Not in the manner that you desire.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Medea Lily
You will only realize your fate the moment you obtain[sr]what you truly desire, then crush it with your own hands.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jason
What... What are you talking about, witch!? What does[sr]a woman who was holed up in a rural shrine know!?
[k]

＠Jason
I was born the son of a king, but my uncle robbed me of[sr]my throne. I was forced into the care of a centaur!
[k]

＠Jason
Even while suffering that indignity, I became resourceful.[sr]I built the Argo and gathered a crew of heroes!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jason
So what part of me!? Where!?[sr]Where am I lacking the qualifications to be king!?
[k]

＠Jason
I just wanted to take back my own land![sr]I just wanted my own nation!
[k]

＠Jason
How is that wrong, you traitor!?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Medea Lily
...Such a pity. Ever since I was summoned,[sr]I have told you nothing but the truth.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Medea Lily
I am Princess Medea. Prior to being betrayed,[sr]I was a witch who blindly believed the one who summoned me.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
That is why I have protected you all this time.[sr]You were chosen by "that" king.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
Everything is real, everything is true.[sr]...Though there may have been some misunderstandings.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Medea Lily
For example, I just said I would protect you, yes?[sr]But how I will protect you[line 2]
