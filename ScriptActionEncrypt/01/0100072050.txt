No, things couldn't possibly get that bad! Quetzalcoatl, are you ready?!

That's unfortunate. I wanted to get rid of your unsightly guardians first. I was a bit rash, again.

Ushiwakamaru, are you planning on getting in our way again!? Have you truly become a slave to Tiamat...!?

＠Ushiwakamaru
I believe I told you already. Mother's control is pleasant. I don't have to think.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I can focus on ridding myself of my hate. The greatest and only delectable pleasure I have is the thought of killing you all.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
There aren't many humans left in the world. I have killed so many of them. I've had enough sensation of the flesh.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
All that's left for me is to destroy Uruk with Mother. There is no greater ecstasy than killing a country, killing the land.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I won't let you get in the way! If Mother's mud doesn't absorb you, then you need to die here.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Ushiwakamaru
...Or maybe you would choose to become my retainers instead of Mother's? That would be pleasurable too.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
In just a few days, I will become one with Mother. Since we're friends, I could turn you into familiars fit to be Demon God Pillars.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Ushiwakamaru
I'll torment and treat you like insects. The same way my brother once treated me!

...Yes. I know you know each other, but it's too late for her. She's all twisted up inside.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Fusion from self-replication. A melting of hundreds of selves together, and she's ready to burst from within.
[k]

＠Ishtar
...I don't even want to imagine what type of monster would come out if that happened.

It's obvious. Only hatred towards humans would flow from my entrails. A tower of flesh made from hundreds and thousands of corpses.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I'll become a blood-crazed warrior, stronger than Gorgon, and kill all of you!

＠Quetzalcoatl
[%1], let's do this! As long as she's there, I won't be able to use my Noble Phantasm!

I'm going to UTTERLY destroy that Darkened Servant!
