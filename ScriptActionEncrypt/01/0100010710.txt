＠Jeanne Alter
Did Rider commit suicide? It's troublesome that she[sr]retained her sanity even with Madness Enhancement.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
Still, she likely fought with all of her might.[sr]If that's the case, we can't let our guard down.

Understood.[sr]If I were who I was before, I would've stopped you.
[k]

But now, you're perfect Jeanne![sr]You don't even need luck!
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Gilles
Please trample over them as much as you wish.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Gilles. Which do you think is the real one?[sr]Me, or her?
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Gilles
Of course it's you.[sr]Are you listening, Jeanne?
[k]

＠Gilles
You were burned at the stake.[sr]Betrayed, by everyone!
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Gilles
Charles VII left you to die, because he didn't want to pay the ransom!
[k]

＠Gilles
Not a single person rose to bravely fight for your return!
[k]

[charaFace H 2]
＠Gilles
And what was the cause of all this?[sr]It was God! It was our God, mocking us!
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Gilles
Thus, we deny God.[sr]Don't we, Jeanne?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
...Yes. Yes you're right, Gilles.[sr]I have nothing left.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
My soldiers are gone, and my admirers fled. The king[sr]betrayed me and the bishop burnt me in the name of God.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
[line 3]I was wrong.[sr]No, everything was wrong.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Not just what I believed in. The very country that allowed me to exist was wrong.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
This mistake must be righted.[sr]Jeanne d'Arc was a mistake.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
So let us do as they decided, and make it all so it never happened.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
My salvation of the country was itself a fatal mistake.
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Gilles
...Jeanne.[sr]Please, don't put yourself under such stress.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Gilles
This is a divine punishment. Nothing more. Your revenge[sr]is righteous. What you saved, you may destroy.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Gilles
Isn't that all there is to it?
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
...You're right, Gilles. What you say is extreme, but it brings me strength.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
Let's go, Berserker, Assassin...[sr]This is getting complicated. May I use your True Names?
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
Lancelot, Knight of the Lake; and the Executioner, Charles-Henri Sanson.

Y-Yes ma'am! Um, by the way, you seem to be of noble birth. What is your name[line 2]

My name is Marie Antoinette![sr]Hehe, it might be worth remembering.

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Don't worry, Jeanne.[sr]We're both Servants, you know.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Now, I've got some great information.[sr]The city St. Martha told us of, Lyon.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
To put it simply, Lyon was destroyed a little while ago.[sr]Its refugees have settled here.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
The "used to be" nuance interests me.[sr]...So it's just as I thought?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Yes. The town is filled with monsters that seem to have risen from the depths of Hell.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
But I think what came before that is the important part.[sr]They said Lyon had a protector.

[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
Yes. But a little while ago, some scary people came.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Servants, probably. He was overwhelmed by their numbers and is now missing.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
And so Lyon was destroyed...

Oh, right. Charles VII visited the village and General Gilles de Rais marshalled the routed soldiers, they said.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]

Gilles!

He's attempting to attack Lyon and take back the city.

Why is that?[sr]Gilles de Rais is an admirer of Jeanne, right?

If Jeanne asks, he's sure to lend a helping hand?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
...That's precisely the reason.[sr]He knows that I've become the Dragon Witch.
[k]

＠Jeanne
He wouldn't accept me like that.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
...I see.[sr]I'm not sure if that's quite right.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Marie Antoinette
But I understand that you might not want to see him![sr]You're a girl, after all.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
Yes, I agree we don't need to see him![sr]We're in a hurry, after all.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
I don't think normal soldiers can handle all those monsters in Lyon, anyway...
[k]

＠Jeanne
...You're quite right.[sr]Let's defeat them on our own.
[k]

？1：We can do it.

Maria has a bad habit of kissing everything.[sr]It caused chaos in the palace.

There were actually factions formed of people she'd kissed and people she hadn't.
