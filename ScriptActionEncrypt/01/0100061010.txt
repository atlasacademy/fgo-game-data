Yeah. Everyone who lives in the mountains left the Holy Land for one reason or another.

...That said, they still built villages rather close. They still wanted to pray as close to the Holy Land as they could.

That's the eastern village we're headed to.[sr]I hope they take us in...

Wait, Old Man of the Mountain. These people protected us all the way here.

＠Refugee Man
We're being chased by the Knights of the Round Table. Can you possibly shelter us in your village?

＠Refugee Man
...I know this sounds selfish, since we've also persecuted you so very much until now...

＠Refugee Man
But please. Some among us are injured, others are pregnant... This is the only place we could run to...

＠???
...Fine, as long as you have some sense of guilt. People of this village all have simple, good-natured hearts.

They themselves don't believe they were persecuted by people of the Holy Land. ...All you need to do is repay their good nature.
