We are forced to witness all the horrors of this world. The revolting and the hideous are forced onto us, burned into our memory.
[k]

＠
The only sensible thing to do is rectify this repulsive state of being.
[k]

＠
But how? Even if we were to eradicate their filth, humans would simply create more.
[k]

＠
The very premise is wrong.[sr]As long as life exists, We can fix nothing.
[k]

＠
It must be redone. That is the only option. Everything must be redone, and perfected right from the beginning.
[k]

＠
What must be erased is not merely history, nor the ecosystem, nor continents, nor time itself.
[k]

＠
We must begin from true nothingness.
[k]

＠
Our plan was to re-create this planet from its beginning.
[k]

＠
In order to do so, considerable resources are required. We need a truly massive amount of fuel.
[k]

＠
For example, the massive amount of energy generated by incinerating all life on this planet.
[k]

＠
But... a one-time harvest will not be enough. We will need to draw from the past, the present, and the future of the whole world.
[k]

＠
One second. One minute. One hour. One day. One month. One year. Energy generated in each of these time spans will be harvested going backwards in time.
[k]

＠
That should work... Three thousand years' worth of the planet's most potent energy.
[k]

＠
Once it is collected, bound, and controlled, our task can be accomplished.

“Surely Lev Lainur was originally an honest man. He must have been seduced by the King of Mages at some point.” Isn't that it?

[messageShake 0.05 4 4 1.0]
Kekeke...hahahahahaha![sr]Beginning 3,000 years ago, of course!

From the moment the plan was set in motion, we were already in place throughout the world!

Lineages destined to birth a Demon God Pillar in a hundred years, in five hundred years...
[k]

＠Lev
...or even one thousand years later![sr]I just happened to be the one designated for 2018 A.D.!
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Lev
We were like seeds planted in the ground.
[k]

＠Lev
An original Order, handed down through generations of mages. A certain “way of being” that must be protected absolutely.
[k]

＠Lev
Our Grand Order is the rule that the King of Mages created for this very moment.
[k]

＠Lev
While human mages established their own principles and theories and passed them down to their descendants...
[k]

＠Lev
We, whose power was born of the King of Mages, survived through the generations until the designated time.
[k]

＠Lev
We etched a curse into our genes to host the Demon God Pillar, and continued our lineage until our appointed era arrived.
[k]

＠Lev
And in 2017, at the point where I awakened as the last designated Demon God Pillar, your history came to an end.
[k]

＠Lev
All necessary resources had been collected. But...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Lev
You Chaldeans insisted on surviving. Why? What made you do that? Did I miscalculate somewhere?
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Lev
No, that's not it. It was because an impostor managed to slip past my watchful gaze.
[k]

＠Lev
Am I right, Romani Archaman?[sr]Seems I underestimated you.
[k]

＠Lev
Or, maybe you were playing the fool in front of me, so things would turn out the way they have?
[k]

＠Lev
If so, that's really a shame. I thought we were friends.
[k]

＠Lev
Medicine and sorcery.[sr]We may not have walked the same path...
[k]

＠Lev
But at least I showed respect for your good nature and the vain efforts you were making.

“I don't know the reason.” “I don't even know who the enemies are.” “There's no guarantee that it's even going to happen.”

He threw his entire life away, believing in the “crisis of mankind” he only saw in a dream.

He continued to wait, believing that something that couldn't possibly happen would, in fact, occur.

＠Da Vinci
He couldn't let his enemies know that he'd noticed.[sr]So he couldn't tell his allies, either.

And since he didn't know how to prepare for that moment, all he could do was study everything he possibly could.
