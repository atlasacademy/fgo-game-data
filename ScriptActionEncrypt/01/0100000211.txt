The battle is over.[sr]Are you hurt, Director?

＠Olga Marie
...What's going on?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Director? About my situation.[sr]I know it's hard to believe, but the truth is[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Olga Marie
A Demi-Servant, right?[sr]It's pretty obvious that you fused with a Servant.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
What I want to know is why it's successful now all of a sudden!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Olga Marie
Enough of that. You![sr]The civilian who showed up late to my speech!
[k]

[charaTalk A]
＠[%1]
!?
[k]

＠Olga Marie
How did you become a Master?[sr]Only first-class Mages can enter contracts with Servants!
[k]

＠Olga Marie
There's no way you could ever become a Master![sr]What did you do to her to have her do your bidding?
[k]

？1：You are way off base!

？2：Well, don't look at me...

？！

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
There's a misunderstanding, Director.[sr]I'm actually the one who forced the contract.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Olga Marie
What did you say?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I'll explain how it happened. That way we[sr]can understand each other's situation better.

＠Mash
...And that's how it happened. We were dragged[sr]into a Rayshift, and teleported here to Fuyuki.
[k]

＠Mash
No other Master candidates shifted with us.[sr]You're the only human we've run into, Director.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
But this gives me hope. If you're here, that means there must be other candidates who got teleported here...
[k]

＠Olga Marie
...There aren't, actually.[sr]That much I'm certain of.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
...I hate to admit it, but I know why we were shifted to Fuyuki.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
So you understand why we survived?
[k]

＠Olga Marie
All of us here share a common denominator. Neither me, nor you, nor that one "were actually inside the Coffins."
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Though Rayshifting flesh and blood isn't likely to succeed, it's not impossible.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Meanwhile, the coffins have breakers.[sr]When the success rate's below 95%, the power's cut off.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
So they never actually Rayshifted.[sr]We're the only ones here.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
I see. That's why you're the director.
[k]

？1：You can be reliable when you're calm, I see.

[charaFace E 1]
＠Olga Marie
What's that supposed to mean?[sr]Are you saying I'm not usually calm?
[k]

？2：Huh? You weren't planning to shift, Director?

[charaFace E 3]
＠Olga Marie
...Is that a problem? What commander heads to the front lines? Didn't I tell you that you were my tools?
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 0]
＠Olga Marie
...Hmmph, whatever.[sr]I understand the situation now.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
[%1], since it's an emergency I'll approve you and Kyrielight's contract.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
From here on out, you'll follow my commands.[sr]First, let's set up a base camp.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Listen, this is the time to search for a Leyline Terminal.[sr]A place where magical energy converges.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
There we'll be able to contact Chaldea.[sr]So in this town's case...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
This is the point, Director.[sr]The Ley point is at your feet.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Olga Marie
Whoa! Oh r-right, I knew that, I knew that, of course!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Olga Marie
Mash, place your shield on the ground. I'm going to set up a summoning circle, with your Noble Phantasm as the catalyst.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...So she says.[sr]Are you all right with that, Senpai?
[k]

？1：Sure, go ahead and do it.

？2：I'm not about letting go of the weapon.

？！

Don't ask me why.[sr]I'm fully aware that I'm not cut out for this job.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But there's nobody else, Olga Marie.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Currently, the surviving full time staff of Chaldea is less than twenty people, including me.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The reason I'm in charge of operations is because there's no one ranked higher than me who survived.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Dr. Lev was supervising from the Command Room.[sr]There's no way he could survive that blast.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Olga Marie
No way[line 3]Lev...[sr]No, forget that, wait... please wait.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Less than 20 survivors?[sr]What about the Master candidates...the coffins?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
...47, all in critical condition and we're short on medical[sr]supplies. We might be able to save a few, but all of them might be[line 3]

Don't be ridiculous! Cryopreserve them immediately![sr]Think about reviving them later. Your top priority is to make sure they don't die!

I forgot the coffins had those functions![sr]I'll get on it right away!

Yet you made the decision right away. You put human[sr]lives ahead of your own reputation as the director.

[charaFace E 1]

Don't be stupid! As long as they're not dead, I can explain myself later - why else?

In the first place, 47 lives...[sr]There's no way can I carry that burden!

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Chaldea has lost 80% of its functionality.[sr]There's only so much that the remaining staff can do.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm shifting available manpower to Rayshift repairs, and maintaining Chaldeas' and Sheba's current states.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As soon as external communications are back up, we'll request supplies and start rebuilding Chaldea.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That's fine.[sr]I would've done the same if I were there.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
...Ah. Romani Archaman. I don't like it, but until I return you're in charge of Chaldea.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Make the Rayshift repairs your top priority.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
We'll be investigating this town.[sr]The Singularity F.

＠Dr. Roman
Director, you're not afraid to be at ground zero?[sr]Since when did you become so brave?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Olga Marie
...Seriously, you don't know when to shut up.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Olga Marie
I'd like nothing better than to go back now, but it's going to take time till you finish the Rayshift repairs.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
This town only contains low-level monsters, with Mash as a Demi-Servant we'll be safe.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Accident or not, we Animuspheres pride ourselves on doing our best in the situations we're given.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
I'll be looking into Singularity F with [%1] and Mash Kyrielight as investigators.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That said, since my field staff is inexperienced, the extent of this mission will be to discover the cause of this anomaly.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Analysis and eradication will have to wait until after Chaldea's restored, and I can send in a second team. You okay with that?
[k]

？1：Only discover it?

？2：That would be nice and easy.

？！

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Roger that. Best of luck to you, Director.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We can now communicate in short bursts.[sr]Feel free to contact me in an emergency.

[charaFace E 3]

I can't afford to do that... After we return to Chaldea, who knows how long it will take to select the next team?

A month won't be enough to gather personnel or funds.[sr]Do you know how much the Association will harass me in the meantime?

Worst case, they'll blame me for mismanagement, and I'll lose Chaldea to them.
