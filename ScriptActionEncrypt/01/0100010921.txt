We're done here.[sr]Siegfried, are you all right?

[charaFace G 4]
＠Siegfried
I've recovered enough to walk.[sr]Anything but combat should be fine.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Siegfried
...I'm going to be making trouble for you a little longer. I'm sorry.

＠Jeanne
...
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
Jeanne, Jeanne.[sr]You have a scary look on your face!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
What? ...D-Do I look scary?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Hehehe, not so much scary as... Stern?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
Well... I guess so.[sr]I was doing some thinking.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
You mean about the Dragon Witch?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
...Yes. Exactly.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
From the day I was born I've received God's revelations, and I just ran off without even looking back.
[k]

＠Jeanne
I became a Heroic Spirit after I died, and then was[sr]summoned as a Ruler. ...I accept this fact as part of the natural order of things.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
I don't understand[line 2]anything the Dragon Witch says, not a single word.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
I wonder... Who that "me" is.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
[line 2]Ah, you really are beautiful.[sr]Very, very, very[line 2]beautiful.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
D-Don't tease me.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Well, it's the truth.[sr]If I were you[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
I would probably accept the things the "Dragon Witch" says.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
...Marie?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
I don't hate the people who executed me.[sr]It's a fact that I'm 90% positive about.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
But the 10% that's left...[sr]Or, it might be much smaller than that.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
I hated those who killed my children[line 2][sr]just for a little bit.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
!!!
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
They killed my son Charles, to hurt me...[sr]You should truly feel pity for him.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
So, if my version of the Dragon Witch appears,[sr]I would probably think "oh, that's the other me."
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
And accept the things she says.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
But that's not the case for you, is it Jeanne?[sr]It's something really great and beautiful.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
It's not because you don't want to get dirty, or don't want to believe you are. Nor does that mean you lack something.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
You like[line 2]people, don't you?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
People who try to move forward by groveling around.[sr]The unreasonable ones, the accusers.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne
...Yes. I do love them. Oh I see, there was no way I could hold a grudge against them[line 2]because I loved them.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Yes. That's why France was saved by you.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
It's okay, tell the Dragon Witch when you see her.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
Tell her?[sr]Well, tell her what?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Say what you want to say out loud.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
Say, "You're not me."[sr]Or, "I don't know you."
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Marie...[sr]Well, you're right. Absolutely right.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
I certainly[line 2]Oh, huh?[sr]...Know you, maybe?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
You're starting to look serious again...[sr]I'm sorry, it wasn't of any help?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Y-Yes.[sr]...It was very helpful.
[k]

＠Jeanne
When I confront her next time, I'm sure I can tell her what I want to say.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Yes, you should be fine.[sr]Oh, I think it's time to make our regular contact.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne
That's right we should. Let's do that now[line 2]
