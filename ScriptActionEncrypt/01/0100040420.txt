＠Fou
Fou...
[k]

＠Mordred
Crushed the dolls. There.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
But[line 3][sr]What is this sort of thing even called?
[k]

＠Mordred
In Asia they have a term for it, don't they?[sr]"En" or something. It's like fate?
[k]

＠Mordred
Gathering all sorts of Heroic Spirits and making them[sr]your allies[line 3]That's not something you can achieve easily.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
But well, if that's the way you're using[sr]the summons I guess it's possible.
[k]

＠Mordred
This method should indeed make Heroic Spirit summons[sr]easier. I can imagine who it was that suggested it.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Mordred
To be honest, it feels strange to me...[sr]...But that, I suppose, is also fate.

?
[k]

？1：What is Mordred talking about?

？2：Is it about the summoning system?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes... It seems so, anyways. Are you talking[sr]about the Heroic Spirit Summoning System?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Um... Mordred, do you know much about Heroic Spirit[sr]summons? Like you're a Saber with magecraft knowledge?
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
What did you just say, Shieldy? Do I have[sr]magecraft knowledge? Are you being sarcastic or...
[k]

＠Mordred
...Wait, that's not what you meant, huh.[sr]Argh, you're such a pain in the ass, Mash!
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Y-Yes...! I don't know why I just got scolded,[sr]but in any case I'm very sorry!
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Mordred
I'm not scolding, it's just a complaint![sr]That's another thing you two have in common!
[k]

？1："You two?"

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
...Forget it. That was a slip of the tongue.[sr]Don't probe any further, [%1].
[k]

？2：Touchy, aren't you?

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Of course, I am. Being cranky is my default mode.[sr]It's 'cause I'm a mass killer, as far from a saint as one can be.
[k]

＠Mordred
You guys are the ones that are getting too close in the[sr]first place. People are normally scared of me, being the Treacherous Knight and all.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
...Tch! Look, you guys aren't the problem here, okay?[sr]It's my own nature that's the problem.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
So don't misunderstand me. It's not that I hate either[sr]Mash or [%1]. I don't hate you, that's not it, but[line 3]

I can't help myself. Come on, let's fight.[sr]Get that shield up. I'll batter it to pieces.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
？1：You ARE upset!

？2：Treacherous Berserker!

？！

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
Yeah, insult me all you want.[sr]I'm used to it. Feels better than awkward compliments.
[k]

？1：I won't let Mash engage in needless battles.

？2：To fight Mash, go through me first[line 3]

Oh, so you CAN act like a Master. Though it would've[sr]looked a lot cooler if your knees weren't shaking, you know?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
The weak should act like one and stay back. Because[sr]they meddle in things like that, they're the first to die, yeah?

You parried my first attack! How cheeky! You're finally[sr]learning how to use that thing the way you should!

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
That's good. Here goes, Shieldy! You must always be[sr]one step ahead of your own limit to protect your allies!
[k]

＠Mordred
If you're gonna use that Noble Phantasm, put some spirit[sr]in it! As an experienced Servant, I will train you thoroughly!
