[charaFace E 4]

Hmm... I think I understand.
[k]

＠Ana
Wanting to take a walk because there's nothing else to do... Remembering that we were at Uruk just yesterday...
[k]

＠Ana
For some reason, those kinds of things keep popping up in my head. They have been keeping me awake... It's pathetic...
[k]

？1：Is it really, though?

[charaFace E 3]

...Yes. Because I know I have been fighting as a stoic Heroic Spirit up until now.

It's not good to be showing my emotional side all of a sudden. Keeping your composure is very important.
[k]

From the time we met in the forest all the way until now, you've never asked me anything.
[k]

Trusting a suspicious Servant like me without asking anything is strange in itself.
[k]

？1：Did you enjoy Uruk?

？！

[charaFace E 3]
＠Ana
Well...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Ana
...No, not really, since I dislike humans.
[k]

＠Ana
...Humans are smart creatures. You constantly look for other possibilities and “what ifs.”
[k]

＠Ana
You will always choose what's better. That's why human cities vary from one another.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Ana
However... When something new is created, what happens to the things that are no longer “better”?
[k]

＠Ana
It would've been fine if they just became “ordinary.” Or if humans forgot about them. Or stopped using them.
[k]

＠Ana
But no... Humans try to reject them. They say they're evil.
[k]

＠Ana
They believe the new will be useless if the old and ordinary remain.
[k]

＠Ana
...That old lady was being treated the same way, protecting shriveled flowers inside that dark, dreary house of hers.
[k]

＠Ana
...At first, I only helped her because it was a job.
[k]

＠Ana
But she looked so happy, and she told me so many stories.
[k]

＠Ana
Even though she couldn't see anymore, she was at peace. Even though she was lonely, she never spoke of it.
[k]

＠Ana
...She treated me like her grandchild. We ate butter cake together.
[k]

＠Ana
She said, “Isn't it delicious?” ...Even though she couldn't taste anything anymore.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]

[k]

＠Ana
The city of Uruk was like a dream for me. I wanted humans to be nice to me. I wanted to be nice to humans.
[k]

That is how I wanted it to be. That is what my old self wanted.

[k]

How about this? You can ask me one question.
[k]

＠Merlin
Topics like human growth and guidance are just such a pain to answer, so normally I either stay silent or lie my way out...
[k]

＠Merlin
But just for tonight, I will answer anything you want to know. Come, ask away.
[k]

＠Merlin
Of course, you can just walk away and not ask anything. I would actually prefer that more.
[k]

？1：Why did you decide to serve King Gilgamesh?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Merlin
Oh, that. Well, because he's the one who summoned me.
[k]

＠Merlin
Truth be told, King Gilgamesh and myself are very similar in nature.
[k]

＠Merlin
First, neither he nor I have any attachments to humans themselves.
[k]

＠Merlin
He is an adjudicator that tries to keep humans on a fair scale. That is why he protects mankind, but he doesn't favor individuals.
[k]

＠Merlin
On the other hand, I'm just a spectator. I don't ever become an ally. Mankind or individuals, it's all just somebody else's business.

＠Merlin
And second. Although we both say that, we both like humans.
[k]

＠Merlin
You think that's a contradiction? Well, it's just a difference in perspective, that's all.
[k]

＠Merlin
King Gilgamesh sees value in what humans create.
[k]

＠Merlin
“Humans themselves are foolish, but the things humans create have meaning...”
[k]

＠Merlin
That's probably a belief that lies at his core. On the other hand, I...
[k]

＠Merlin
I'm interested in the end of mankind. I continue to survive just so I can witness that.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Merlin
Well, it just means we're both inhuman. That's part of the reason we've decided to work together.
[k]

＠Merlin
We have our differences in how we enjoy it, but our goals are the same: to continue humanity, and witness its eventual end.
[k]

＠Merlin
That is the reason I decided to serve King Gilgamesh.
[k]

？2：Are you the one who sent out Bedivere?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Merlin
Ah, so you're going there... That's a little painful[line 2]no...quite painful for me.
[k]

＠Merlin
I am the one who sent him to the Holy Land. When the Lion King appeared, that's when he appeared in Avalon.
[k]

＠Merlin
In order to solve that twisted fate, there was no other way but to send Bedivere over.
[k]

＠Merlin
I knew very well that it would be a cruel decision forced upon him.
[k]

＠Merlin
I am inhuman, but that doesn't mean I'm a scumbag. I didn't want Bedivere to suffer if it could be avoided.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Merlin
But, you know. If only the Lion King disappeared, or if only Bedivere remained in Avalon,
[k]

＠Merlin
as a fellow member of the Round Table, it would have felt odd. I mean, I was King Arthur's mentor, after all.
[k]

＠Merlin
Even though I was aware of Bedivere's pain, I decided to prioritize correcting Altria's mistake.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Merlin
Well, of course. I'm not human like you. I'm a completely different creature who just happens to have a human form.
[k]

＠Merlin
Humans may call me a sage, but not once have I ever acted in their interests.
[k]

＠Merlin
I'm a mix between an incubus and a human. Incubi are spirits that feed on the minds of humans.
[k]

＠Merlin
Usually, they don't have an “identity.” That's because they copy the personality of the human they're feeding off of.
[k]

＠Merlin
Incubi just take human mental activity as a source of energy.
[k]

＠Merlin
However, I'm half-human, so I have half an ego... I came to hold a sense of purpose.
[k]

＠Merlin
I only came to be called a sage because I learned that was how everyone would accept me.
[k]

＠Merlin
I'm no more than a monster pretending to be human.
[k]

＠Merlin
I studied humans and tried experiencing emotions, but I still couldn't understand them.
[k]

＠Merlin
Of course, I have intelligence, so I understand human pain. But I can't really understand the burden of it.
[k]

＠Merlin
No matter how far I get, it's always someone's dream. I can speak of love and hate, but I cannot truly experience them.

However, even for someone like me, there's one thing that will bring me happiness. A unique purpose that only I have, even among other incubi.
[k]
？1：And that is...?

？！

＠Merlin
A happy ending for mankind, of course.
[k]

＠Merlin
In mankind's final moments, I want to see the very last human's dream.
[k]

＠Merlin
If you humans don't exist, then neither do I. I am a Phantasmal. We lose meaning without you.
[k]

＠Merlin
Incubi don't have any direction or preference. Well, maybe we lean towards bad dreams, since they're higher in nutrition.
[k]

＠Merlin
But I still have an ego. If I don't have a meaning[line 2]a purpose[line 2]I cannot live.
[k]

＠Merlin
So, I have chosen your ending as my purpose.
[k]

＠Merlin
Humans are foolish. Not in a philosophical way, but in a biological sense.
[k]

＠Merlin
There are no other intelligent species so wasteful in the universe. And at the same time, there are none so unpredictable, either.
[k]

＠Merlin
You humans are truly flawed creatures. But...
[k]

＠Merlin
But the history you create is beautiful.
[k]

This much I can say with certainty: no matter what kind of end humanity faces, your history will be worth leaving in this universe.
