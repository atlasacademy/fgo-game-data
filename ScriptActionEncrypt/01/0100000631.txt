Sigh... Things have settled down at last.[sr]True, we can't have a decent conversation like this.

＠Caster
My bad. If I'd been summoned as a Lancer,[sr]I could've finished off Saber with just one strike.
[k]

＠Caster
Man, Caster is just not for me.[sr]I don't like being a Caster in a Holy Grail War like this.
[k]

？1：If you were a Lancer?

？2：Is it hard being a Caster?

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
It's been known to happen, Senpai. Some Heroic Spirits[sr]have the attributes of multiple classes.
[k]

＠Mash
He is not just a spear-wielder, but a high-level Heroic Spirit with qualifications to be a mage.
[k]

＠Mash
...I'm only speculating, but he must be one of the top[sr]Servants. The kind that's featured in the magazine Vivian.

＠Caster
Ahh yes, you said you were Masters of an organization[sr]called Chaldea... I guess that's all I need to know.
[k]

＠Caster
In general, Servants tend not to get overly involved in problems outside of their own time period.[sr]We ultimately only cooperate as weapons.
[k]

＠Caster
Your goal is to investigate this anomaly.[sr]My goal is to put an end to the Holy Grail War.
[k]

＠Caster
We share mutual interests.[sr]So how about we join forces?

＠Olga Marie
...That is a rational proposition.[sr]But if we do that, who will be your Master?
[k]

＠Caster
Well that [&kid:young lady] there, of course. It doesn't seem like you have the aptitude to be a Master.
[k]

＠Caster
I mean you possess high quality magical circuits, yet you[sr]don't have the aptitude to be a Master. Is it a curse?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Olga Marie
Oh, shut up![sr]What do you care?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Olga Marie
[%1], he's in your hands.[sr]Use him wisely.
[k]

＠Caster
Then it's settled.[sr]The contract is only temporary, but I'm counting on ya.
[k]

＠Caster
That leaves one last thing, your goal.[sr]What you're looking for is probably the Greater Grail.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Greater Grail?[sr]I'm not familiar with that. What is it?
[k]

＠Caster
This land's true "heart."[sr]If there is indeed a "Singularity," it has to be that.
[k]

＠Caster
But Saber is lingering around the Greater Grail.[sr]The remaining Servants she contaminated, too.

＠Olga Marie
Berserker and Archer are the ones left?[sr]What are those two like? Are they strong?
[k]

＠Caster
Well, Archer can be dealt with if I'm with you.[sr]Berserker is the problem.
[k]

＠Caster
Even Saber had trouble with that monster.[sr]But he won't attack unless you get close to him, so ignoring him is one option.
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0]

＠Dr. Roman
We understand the situation now. We'll team up[sr]with Mr. Caster to obtain the Greater Grail.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Mr. Caster, would you show us the way?
[k]

＠Caster
Skip the "Mister." I'll take you there.[sr]The [&kid:young lady] here will decide when to make our move.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Much obliged. Then shall we resume the search?[sr]I'm counting on you, [%1].
