＠Quetzalcoatl
Now. Why destroy Uruk?[sr]I'll at least answer that question.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
It's because we were called over by Mother to kill humans.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
It is our purpose here, and we can't change it.[sr]So, that's what we'll do.

＠Quetzalcoatl
But, how I do so is up to me, no? It'd be boring to just drop the sun and burn everything, no?

＠Quetzalcoatl
Yes! I want to have fun. I don't want to fight out of hatred. Sooooo...
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Quetzalcoatl
I decided that no matter who I'm against, I'll kill them one by one, and that's how I'll eradicate humanity, yes!
[k]

？1：Seriously, in a fistfight!?
？2：Dios mio, through lucha wrestling!?

？！

[charaFace E 1]

Sí! So I won't use my Authority as a goddess![sr]Because that tires me out, yes!

I only fight one hundred people a day! Any more than that, and I start forgetting my opponents.

I wouldn't want to make fighting a chore, no![sr]Death matches should always be of the highest quality!
