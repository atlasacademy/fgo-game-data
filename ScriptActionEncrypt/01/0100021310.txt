Umu[line 3]In other words, it's the final showdown!
[k]

＠Nero
Now is the time to gather my strength and yours, as my[sr]soldiers. With this battle, Rome will become one again!
[k]

[seStop ad16 3]
＠Nero
Those miserable pretenders to the throne...[sr]Now is the time for the false Rome to fall!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
Fight, my soldiers![sr]As my swords, annihilate every one of those pretenders!
[k]

＠Nero
My sword is the Original Flame, and the sound of it[sr]clashing is like a star streaking across the sky.
[k]

＠Nero
Listen in awe and praise it![sr]Rejoice, my Swords!

The battle has already started, but there's still no sign of any Servants.
[k]

＠Mash
We'll be taking part in the palace raid.[sr]I hope we can find that court mage...
[k]

？1：You mean Lev Lainur?

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mash
I can't say for sure, but it's a strong possibility.
[k]

？2：Professor Lev...

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mash
A dangerous man who killed the Director, and proclaimed the world to have ended.[sr]There's no room for sympathy, Senpai.

＠Dr. Roman
Mash, [%1], be extremely careful.[sr]Who knows what will happen if we run into the holder of the Grail.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A dragon was summoned with the power of the Grail last[sr]time. This time it might not just be used to summon Heroic Spirits.

You are truly brave, and that is why you rule over the current Rome.

＠Nero
Hmm[line 2]
[k]

＠Mash
We've got visual confirmation.[sr]One large target, near the entrance to the palace.
[k]

＠Mash
To us...he's talking to us.[sr]It seems Nero heard him too.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
His voices reaches this far even on the battlefield?[sr]As expected of Servants, even their vocal cords are different. 
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠E：???
I see.[sr]So you're Nero?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠E：???
How adorable. How beautiful. How gorgeous.[sr]I can see how you held Rome up with those slender arms of yours.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠E：???
Now, come.

＠Nero
W-Well...
[k]

？2：Why are you so afraid?

[charaFace D 3]
＠Nero
Afraid?[sr]A-And...just what would I be afraid of?
[k]

＠Nero
I am the Roman Emperor...[sr]That's right, Rome...

＠E：???
I'm sure you understand, Nero.
[k]

＠E：???
Now come back, come back to Rome my dear child.
[k]

＠E：???
It's Rome.[sr]Rome is the true leader of the United Empire.
[k]

＠E：???
You should join, as well. You shall be[sr]forgiven for everything. Rome shall forgive you.
[k]

＠E：???
Rome will even love that inner beast of yours.[sr]Rome is the only one that can do that.
[k]

＠E：???
That's right[line 2]
[k]

＠E：???
I am Rome.
