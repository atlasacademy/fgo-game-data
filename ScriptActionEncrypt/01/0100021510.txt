Right. With the release of an Anti-Fortress Noble[sr]Phantasm so close, I'm amazed that you're not dead.

Thank you, Mash.[sr]You too, Boudica. That was great timing.

...To be honest, that was too close.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Boudica
I ran in to raid the palace from the entrance, only to sense this vast amount of magical energy, so I rushed to release my Noble Phantasm's True Name as well.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
I couldn't have blocked that with my Noble Phantasm[sr]alone. Thank you, Boudica.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Boudica
Likewise.[sr]But, what are we going to do now.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Boudica
Lu Bu and Spartacus were rampaging around the palace[sr]entrance and unfortunately got hit by that light.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Boudica
We can't count on them any more.[sr]We've gotten this far...

Already started her advance from the Untied Empire's[sr]capital. Judging from the direction, she's heading for Rome.

＠Dr. Roman
I'd imagine so.[sr]Plus, she has that ability.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even if you're left alive, with the capital destroyed, Rome will disappear as well.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Or she might come to kill you after she destroys the capital.

Either option is rejected. I have no[sr]intention of allowing Rome or myself to fall.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
Then we have to defeat Altera.[sr]But can we...even stand up to her?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Her magical energy is tremendous. It reminded[sr]me of the sacred sword in Fuyuki...
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
And we had a powerful Caster helping us back then.[sr]Now...
[k]

You can't do it, Mash?

＠Nero
I would like to think otherwise. [%1][sr]and Mash have saved me multiple times.
[k]

＠Nero
You were talking about gods and the like, I'm certain the gods and fate are on our side.
[k]

＠Nero
That's why [%1] and the rest of you[sr]came here. My wish shall see its fruition.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Rome will be saved. My people and my Rome[sr]will be left for future generations. I'm sure of it.
[k]

＠Nero
The Holy Progenitor said so as well.[sr]I heard it.
[k]

＠Nero
The world must be eternal.[sr]Rome must continue on eternally.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Even if its name will someday be forgotten, the many[sr]seeds Rome planted will continue on in different forms.
[k]

＠Nero
The eternal empire will continue to exist.[sr]Even if its emperor, state, and name changes.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
It is the innate truth that mankind will continue to thrive.[sr]The tree of life that is humanity.

[line 3][%1].[sr]I am sure that is the "Humanity" you are trying to protect.

How about thinking more romantically?[sr]Nero's words gave me strength.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
She's confident that we can fight Altera.[sr]That's why the world won't end.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Sounds good to me.[sr]Although there's no real basis for it[line 2]
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
But it makes you feel like we should at least try.[sr][%1], what do you think?

Well then everyone, time to head out![sr]Let's get the Grail back and save the world!

...At least that was the plan until a second ago.[sr]I am picking up a major magical energy signature.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 2]

It must've be drawn to the power of the Grail when it[sr]connected with Altera[line 2]Phantasmals, it's the wyverns!
