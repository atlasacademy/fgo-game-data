...No. It's just as you say, Mash.

I fought a Knight of the Round Table, and was defeated.[sr]I can no longer call myself a knight of the king.

This doesn't clear away my foolishness...[sr]but I have lost my reason to fight you all.

...But still, someone that stubborn accepting their loss so easily... I wonder why?

？1：Sanzang, Galahad is...
？2：Sanzang, Lancelot is...

No, not quite, Sanzang.

＠Mash
The only time he seemed like a father was when Galahad was a child. Galahad's Spirit Origin wants to make that known.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
In reality, the relationship between Sir Lancelot and Sir Galahad was not very good.

Hm. The hostility and bloodlust have been neatly and cleanly erased. Sir Lancelot is no longer an enemy, I see.

[charaFace F 0]
＠Tawara Touta
Now what do we do, [%1]?
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
Capture Sir Lancelot and enter the Holy City, or entrust him to the mountain people? That is an option as well.
[k]


？1：What about making him an ally?

An ally? ...Hah. You are right. You say so naturally what even I would have difficulty spitting out.

If Sir Lancelot became our ally, I could not ask for more.

If I disappear, all knowledge of it will be lost.[sr]More than anything, I would like to avoid that.

＠Lancelot
My unit will escort you.[sr]From here it is only half a day's travel.

Sir Lancelot... You gave the refugees shelter here?!
[k]

＠Lancelot
...There was no choice but to send those chosen by the Holy Selection to the Holy City.
[k]

＠Lancelot
I was free to do as I wished with those who weren't chosen. The king didn't order me to execute them.
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Lancelot
Moreover, there were quite a few knights who disobeyed the king. There also needs to be a place for them.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]

So I used them to guard the refugees.[sr]In short, my private army.
