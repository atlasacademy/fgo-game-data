Quotation from King Arthur, Number 8. “Nutritionally, a strange creature's meat is no different from any other meat!”

Yes... Mash Kyrielight, digging in. Survival can be cruel sometimes...

But we need to eat this. For Da Vinci... Otherwise, how will I be useful to Senpai?

It's tough, but soft... and squishy. This scent stabs at my nose... and seeps into my brain...

Thank you very much, Bedivere... You've added mint for us. How thoughtful...

I respectfully and wholeheartedly decline!

I realized after climbing the mountain, but the wasteland is scattered with unnatural indentations.

The knights call it the “Lion King's Judgment,” so we call it that, too.

＠Dr. Roman
...Yes. But there aren't any in this era's original timeline.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's probably King Arthur's Noble Phantasm. A tremendous power that the king unleashes indiscriminately.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Much like Solomon's band of light in the sky. That explains why the mana density in the atmosphere is so high.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Unbelievable. The Lion King's going to destroy this place.

...You guys didn't know about the Lion King's Judgment? So that's why you were able to act so defiantly...
[k]

＠Refugee Man
No, sorry. Even if you knew, you guys would have saved us. We know that.
[k]

＠Refugee Man
But do remember this. There is nowhere left for us to go now.
[k]

＠Refugee Man
We don't know when the Judgment will befall the wastelands. Escape into the desert, and the Sun King's beasts devour us.
[k]

＠Refugee Man
The mountains are relatively safe, but there is no more food up here.
[k]

＠Refugee Man
...We had to go to the Holy City to survive. Though that plan became moot as well.

[k]

＠Bedivere
The Round Table has already fallen, and Arthur is now a demon king worse than Vortigern.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I see... For the people of this land, the Holy City's Lion King is an existence that cannot be forgiven and must be eradicated...
