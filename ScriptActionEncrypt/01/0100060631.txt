Ah, thank you so much.[sr]You've saved us.
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
Not only did you drive away those bandits, but you've escorted us as well...

＠Mash
No need to thank us. In fact, thank you for telling us the way to go.
[k]

＠Mash
You all live around here, right? Where are you going with such a large group?
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
Why, the Holy City, of course! That's the only safe place now.
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
Invaders came, burned the land, and took the Holy Land...
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
But the great Lion King drove out the unjust Crusaders, and opened the Holy Land to us.
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
We don't know where the king and his knights came from, but we're thankful that they slaughtered those Crusaders.
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
Still, there are some who lament over such a shameless city being built on the Holy Land...
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
However, the teachings of God are eternal. Regardless of what form the city takes, our prayers will never change.

Does that mean you're refugees heading to the Holy City? Do they allow people of different races to enter?
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
Yes, of course. I hear that the Lion King rejects none.
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
Once a month, the Holy City has a ceremony called the Ritual of Holy Selection in which they accept refugees.
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
If you can reach the Holy City by that day, you won't have anything else to worry about.
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
We were wondering about going ourselves, but then our village was burned down...

I see... I'm sorry to hear that. Is this everyone from the village?
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
No, only about half... There were some in the village who think ill about the knights residing in the Holy City...
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
They headed to the mountainous region. There's a village there.
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
But... that region is a desolate land.
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
If one wishes to survive in this land, the Holy City is the only real option...

Yes. If we stay together, we'll stand out too much.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We still don't understand the full situation, so it's better to act in secret for a while longer.
[k]

？1：The buggy only fits three, anyway.
？2：It would be bad if we came across a Servant.

...That's right. And we still can't tell who's friend or foe in this situation.
[k]

＠Mash
King Ozymandias of Egypt... The Holy City and the Lion King residing there...
[k]

＠Mash
And finally, Servants in skull masks... Ones we've already crossed paths with twice. They all seem to be Assassins...

＠Dr. Roman
Considering the era, those wearing skull masks would naturally be from the “Old Man of the Mountain” assassination group.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This is their home territory. In fact, the term “assassin” is derived from their group.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The Sun King, the Lion King, and a group of Assassins... Does this mean it's a three-way deadlock?
[k]

？1：Lion beats Sun, Assassin beats Lion...

＠Da Vinci
Exactly! Nitocris and Lucius mentioned something strange, after all!
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
This is just speculation, but it all fits: the Sun King and the Lion King have formed a non-aggression pact.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Remember, Lucius said that the Holy City knights would have no reason to abduct Nitocris.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
The one who rules this land is most likely the Lion King. The Egyptian territory is an independent, separate nation.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Hence we can assume that the kings have formed that pact.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Though they oppose each other, they don't fight... It's a cold war.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
Perhaps the mountain people, the group of Assassins, can't tolerate that and carry out resistance activities.

＠Dr. Roman
...I see. I'm getting a general grasp of the situation.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
First, like the refugees, you should head to the Holy City. There are some things we need to ascertain.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
First, who are these knights who destroyed the Crusaders? And second, how are things there now?
[k]

[communicationCharaClear]

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Mash
Yes. King Ozymandias said that the Holy City is the source of the Singularity.
[k]

＠Mash
We need to go and see if that's the truth!
