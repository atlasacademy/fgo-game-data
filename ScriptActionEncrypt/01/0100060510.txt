We've left the sandstorm! And with the buggy running properly, this is rather pleasant!
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
...By the way, are you tired from driving?[sr]If you are, I could swap with you...
[k]

？1：I'll never give up the wheel!

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Please, don't say that. You should go keep Da Vinci company in the back seat.
[k]

＠Mash
I'll take the wheel while you do.[sr]I'll pull off a magnificent jump from that hill!
[k]

？2：Time for a player sub, Mash.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Please leave it to me. You can take a pit stop.[sr]Mash Kyrielight will defend your position in the race!

Oh, switching drivers? Yes, good. It's dangerous to drive for more than an hour straight.
[k]

[se ad14]

＠Da Vinci
Would you like a meal? Or a massage?[sr]We've also got some cold juice...
[k]

？1：This thing's TOO convenient...
？2：I see you like taking care of people.

Of course. You should already know I'm always aware of what's going on. I'll put together any order with aplomb.

More importantly, we're almost out of the desert.[sr]You can take the mask off whenever you like.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The mana density changes past that big sand dune.[sr]We'll no doubt be able to see what this era's original landscape looks like.
[k]

？1：...That's a little scary.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
Right, I'm a little uneasy too. My worst expectations always have a way of hitting the mark.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
...The reason why King Ozymandias doesn't use the Holy Grail frightens me.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

？2：You seem to be having fun.

[charaFace D 3]
＠Da Vinci
Really? If so, my show of courage must be pretty good.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The Mona Lisa mustn't lose her smile, after all.[sr]I need to smile no matter how uneasy I might be feeling.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

？！

＠Da Vinci
Then again, I suppose my worries will abate soon.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Once we're out of Egyptian territory, we should be able to contact Romani again.
[k]

？1：I suppose the Doctor's worried too.
？2：I suppose the Doctor's on the edge of his seat too.

？！

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
Haha, I'm sure.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
But to be honest, I think this was good.[sr]Romani should have gotten a little break thanks to this.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He's hardly slept a wink since we started the Grand Order.

？！


[charaFace D 2]
＠Da Vinci
Of course. Chaldea lost over 60 staff in that incident.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
How did you think such a shortage was being filled? Romani's job doesn't just involve health care.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
Operating the remaining equipment, maintaining Sheba, controlling Chaldea's generators, planning operations, handling Rayshifts.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
On top of that, taking care of the mental health of the staff that break down each day... though that's technically his main job.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
Since there are no external supplies, the internal staff have to somehow manage.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It would take a genius to do all of these things alone, but Romani isn't one. Nor is he a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
He's an ordinary human, and when ordinary humans have that much work, they sacrifice time and stamina.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
When that isn't enough, they push themselves further, using modern medicine to increase mental acuity or ignore fatigue.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Da Vinci
That's okay. It means his efforts didn't go to waste, at least.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

？！

＠Da Vinci
Also, Chaldea communications aren't ordinary transmissions.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Singularities are both realities and unexplored possibilities. Simply being here is enough to make your existence ambiguous.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You didn't exist in the 13th century, after all. From the point of view of the world itself, you're an unknown.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That's why Chaldea has to constantly verify your existence: to make sure your meaning as a person doesn't vanish.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
By certifying that the human named [%1] is real, your existence at the Rayshift destination is secured.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
Singularities are uncertain. Even if your body exists, some value could deviate from your original self[line 3]
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's possible that this hypothetical, slightly different version of yourself could get projected onto Chaldeas.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
If that happens, you can't return to reality in 2018. That's why they constantly monitor you in the Command Room.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They check all numerical values, and if something appears to be deviating even slightly, they return it to normal.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This is a job where the slightest disparity, the slightest sign, can't be overlooked.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So Romani and the entire Command Room staff give everything they have to support your journey.
[k]

？1：...
？2：But Doctor Roman... What he did to Mash...

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
Ah, what he said before the Rayshift.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Right. Romani is still an accomplice in Chaldea's experiments. For that, you can be angry with him and have your doubts.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
When I was summoned to Chaldea, the first thing I did was denounce Marisbury and Romani.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Da Vinci
Why am I so angry and scornful? That goes without saying. Because ordinary people shouldn't pretend to be geniuses!
[k]

？1：Marisbury?
？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
Oh, you didn't know?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Marisbury Animusphere. Father of Olga Marie, and former director of Chaldea.

They're acting like a wall to block our path![sr]We need to eliminate them to cross the sand dune!

？1：They dare interfere with our big jump!?
？2：Mash! Shield out and punch it!

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes, Master! We'll have them get out of the way of our pleasant drive!
