The seventh corridor and the second spiral staircase. This is the fastest route to the throne.

They don't have many people on hand in here, surprisingly. Maybe we can get to the Lion King without anyone getting in our way.

Yes. Sir Bedivere, how are you feeling?

＠Bedivere
You don't have to worry about me, [%1], Lady Mash.
[k]

＠Bedivere
My arm has been feeling better for a while now, and I should also be feeling better shortly.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Your words are a comfort to me, and I am afraid no longer.
[k]


？1：Afraid?

？！

That's enough talking! I'm detecting a strong Spirit Origin from down the rear stairs!

It's... a Knight of the Round Table! Sir Gawain is coming up!

...So he came. There's no way he wouldn't make it in time.

＠Bedivere
Let us consider ourselves fortunate that the goddess of victory is on our side.
[k]

＠Bedivere
If he decided to interfere while we were fighting the Lion King we would have no chance of winning.
[k]


？1：...You've gotten stronger.
？2：That's exactly right!

？！

Yes, we've made it this far so maybe you can say I've had a change of heart.

Yes, I gave each knight their choice. I no longer have anything to do with their fate.
[k]

＠Gawain
Whether I strike you down here, or I am the one to fall, the fate of the Holy City will not change.
[k]

＠Gawain
When the Tower appeared, our job here was done. The only thing left for us in the Round Table is for each of us to figure out how to serve the king.

＠Bedivere
...It does seem so. Your resolve has not changed. In the end, you remain the sword of the king.
[k]

＠Bedivere
You would not stop me from revealing the king's mistakes and denouncing the Holy City.

＠Gawain
Of course. The king said this to me when I was summoned here.

＠Gawain
“Knight of the Sun, the other bearer of the sacred sword. You should take this chance to grant your desire.”
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Gawain
The king told me I could do anything. I could leave the Holy City, or even strike him down.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Gawain
...You couldn't understand just how happy I was in that moment.
[k]

＠Gawain
You just happened to be there for the king and take care of him in his final moments.
[k]

＠Gawain
I was once called the right-hand man of the king, but unable to cast away my own personal grudges, I caused his death.
[k]

＠Gawain
...I cannot repeat that foolishness again.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Gawain
King Arthur is not the same king he once was.[sr]The king understands that more than anyone.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Gawain
He wouldn't call himself the Lion King if that wasn't the case. He gave us all a choice from the beginning.
[k]

＠Gawain
Britain's Round Table has fallen to ruin. Our world has fallen to ruin.
[k]

＠Gawain
The Lion King declared he will protect the world. No matter how self-righteous that might be.
[k]

＠Gawain
Why do you think we alone are left of the Round Table in the Holy City? It should not need to be said.
[k]

＠Gawain
The second chair, Percival. The third chair, Kay. The sixth, Gaheris. The ninth, Palamedes.
[k]

＠Gawain
The advisor, King Pellinore. The next 11th chair, Bors.
[k]

＠Gawain
After they were summoned by the king, they showed their loyalty by revolting against the Lion King.
[k]

＠Gawain
They were all wonderful knights. They challenged the king in battle to protect the king's honor.
[k]

＠Gawain
...And we disposed of them all.

＠Gawain
That's right. Sir Bedivere, you were not the only one granted the right to slay your own brethren.
[k]

＠Gawain
The moment we pledged our loyalty to the Lion King we were already branded sinners. No matter what happens, I will not betray the Lion King.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Gawain
At the same time, I am grateful. I do not know the reasons the King of Knights became the Lion King...
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Gawain
However, my wish will stay with the Lion King.
[k]

＠Gawain
Because King Arthur has the sacred lance, and he needed us, the Knights of the Round Table, to be the means to destroy this world...
[k]

＠Gawain
I am no longer a knight serving the King of Knights. I am Gawain, a knight serving the Lion King.
[k]

＠Gawain
...That's all I have to say to you. Draw your sword, Sir Bedivere.
[k]

＠Gawain
What you want to protect and what I must protect are like oil and water. Allow me to ask once more, what is your sword for!?

...Then I shall answer. My right arm is the end of my loyalty, my proof of a sin that I could not erase.

＠Bedivere
What it dreamed of was the king. For the sake of truly saving the one who walked alone...
[k]

＠Bedivere
...I will cut down anyone who stands in my way! With my arm, now the silver arm of Nuadha, Airgetlám!
