＠Da Vinci
Ah... This is bad... There's just too much difference between us... The power of divinity that surpasses that of a genius...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That is truly the power of an Authority... A normal Servant couldn't stand up against that.

This is the end. As your lives wither away, the Ends of the World shall be unleashed.

＠Lion King
I am the King of the Storm, the wave that will swallow this earth. I am the one who shall bring an end to this world!

＠Lion King
Your limited lives will receive eternity.
[k]

＠Lion King
I will freeze the lives of yours that will burn up and store them. I will stop them from losing any value.

＠Lion King
That is the meaning behind “protecting” lives. The ultimate conclusion of what it means to protect humans.

＠Mash
You're wrong. I don't agree with your concept of happiness.
[k]

＠Mash
I've seen a lot of different lives in this era!
[k]

＠Mash
Someone died to protect a child! And there was someone who grieved about it!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
And... they continued to live on in spite of all of it.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
There was someone who thought that their mom would continue living on as long as they were alive!
[k]

＠Mash
Having an end isn't meaningless! Life continues on. It doesn't just exist for only a single moment!
[k]

＠Mash
Even if these losses continue to mount forever, life will continue to spread out, connecting us all!
