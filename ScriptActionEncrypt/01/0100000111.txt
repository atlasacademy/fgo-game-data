[line 3]phew.[sr]I had my worries, but we made it somehow.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Are you hurt Senpai?[sr]Does your stomach hurt, or does it feel heavy?
[k]

？1：What was that?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...I don't know.[sr]Something that doesn't exist in our era, let alone this era.
[k]

＠Mash
That was the cause of the Singularity, or something like[sr]it. I guess calling it that isn't too far off, or maybe it is.
[k]

？2：Mash, you're that powerful?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
...No, in combat training I always had to stay after class.[sr]I couldn't even do a pull-up.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The reason I was able to fight like that just now[line 3]
[k]

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Right, I finally got through! Hello?[sr]This is Chaldea Command Room? Do you read me?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
This is Mash Kyrielight, a member of A Team.[sr]At this time, I've completed the shift to Singularity F.
[k]

＠Mash
My sole companion is [%1].[sr]Mind and body both intact.
[k]

＠Mash
Rayshift compatibility, Master compatibility both[sr]satisfactory. Please register [%1] as an official researcher.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
...So [%1] also got dragged into the Rayshift, huh?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
I'm impressed you didn't "lose your existence."[sr]I'm really glad.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 2]
＠Dr. Roman
Also, Mash... Of course I'm glad you're safe, too...[sr]But what's up with that outfit?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's shameless![sr]I didn't raise you to dress like that!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
I transformed into this.[sr]I couldn't protect Senpai wearing Chaldea's uniform.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
What do you mean by transformed, Mash?[sr]Did you hit your head? Or was it that...
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
[line 3]Dr. Roman. Please be quiet.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Please check my condition.[sr]I think you'll understand the situation better.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 2]
＠Dr. Roman
Your physical condition?[sr]Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa, WHOA!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Physical strength, Magical Circuits, everything's[sr]improved! You're not so much a human, but[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes, I'm a Servant.
[k]

＠Mash
I don't remember how it happened, but it seems I have survived by fusing with a Servant.
[k]

＠Mash
To investigate and resolve Singularity F, a Servant was provided in advance at Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
This Servant lost its Master in that explosion, and was doomed to vanish.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
But at the last second, he offered me a contract.
[k]

＠Mash
In return for the abilities and Noble Phantasm of a Heroic Spirit, he wanted me to eliminate the cause of this Singularity.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
A Heroic Spirit and a human, fused...[sr]A Demi-Servant? That's Chaldea's sixth experiment.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I see. So it finally succeeded, huh?[sr]Does this Heroic Spirit still have his consciousness?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...No, he gave me his combat abilities then vanished.
[k]

＠Mash
He never revealed his True Name even at the end.[sr]So I don't even know whose Heroic Spirit I am...
[k]

＠Mash
...Nor what kind of Noble Phantasm I'm holding.[sr]At this point there's too much I don't know.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Hey, look on the bright side.[sr]Not every Servant who gets summoned is cooperative.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Now that you're a Servant, this is in our favor.[sr]After all, you're completely trustworthy.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
[%1], it looks like you're the only one who Rayshifted there safely.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Also, I am sorry.[sr]Forcing you into this without any explanation.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
I'm sure you're full of questions, but try not to worry.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You've already got a powerful weapon.[sr]Humanity's most powerful weapon - Mash.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I don't know about "most powerful."[sr]I'm the one who gets blamed later.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Now, now, as long as [%1] understands that's what a Servant is, it'll be fine.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But [%1], while Servants can be reliable allies, they also have a weakness.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They disappear without their magical energy source.[sr]Their Master.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
I'm still analyzing the data, but it's indicating that Mash has become your Servant.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Meaning that you're Mash's Master. She's the first[sr]Heroic Spirit you've entered a contract with.
[k]

？1：I'm Mash's Master?

？2：Uh, I can't keep up with what you're saying...

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Right, I don't blame you for being confused. I never[sr]explained what Masters and Servants are to you, anyway.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Now's a good time, I'll explain it to you in detail.[sr]The current mission has two new goals...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Doctor, you're breaking up.[sr]10 seconds until the connection is lost.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Huh, so Sheba's output is unstable because we switched[sr]to the backup generators? Oh well, I'll brief you later.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Both of you, I'm getting a strong leyline reading about[sr]2 km from where you are.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Try to get there somehow.[sr]That way, it will stabilize our connection.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Listen, don't do anything reckless, will you?[sr]I'll try to bring the power back up as soon as[line 3]
[k]

[communicationCharaClear]
[wait communicationChara]
[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
...
[k]

？1：The connection got cut off.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Well, that's the Doctor for you.[sr]You can't rely on him in situations like this.
[k]

？2：It can't be helped, let's get going.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Right, you're so dependable Senpai.[sr]I was actually terrified, so thank goodness.
[k]

？！

＠Fou
Kyu.[sr]Fou, Fooou!
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
That's right, you're with us as well, aren't you Fou?[sr]Thank you for cheering us up.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Apparently, Fou Rayshifted here with you Senpai.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Ah. But I forgot to let the Doctor know...
[k]

＠Fou
Kyu.[sr]Fou, kyaao!
[k]

？1：He said, "don't worry about that guy."

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
You're right.[sr]I'll find the right time to let him know about Fou later.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
First, let's head to the coordinates he mentioned. Once we get there, we should be able to set up a base camp.
