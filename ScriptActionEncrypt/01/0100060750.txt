Hm. Normally, I would not even deem you worthy of a response...
[k]

＠Gawain
But seeing how you put yourself in danger to shield a woman, I shall answer your question.
[k]

＠Gawain
Master from a foreign land. What is your name?
[k]

？1：[&It's:I'm] [%1].

？！

[charaFace E 0]
＠Gawain
Many thanks. Allow me to formally introduce myself, [%1].
[k]

＠Gawain
I am Gawain, a Knight of the Round Table.
[k]

＠Gawain
I serve Arthur, the King of Knights, the pure-white Lion King, protector of humanity, and founder of this Holy City.
[k]

＠Gawain
What we seek is the completion of a utopia, untainted and unstained.
[k]

＠Gawain
The only right way for humans to live is to obey the laws of the Lion King, which will create a pure-white millennial kingdom.
[k]

＠Gawain
To do that, we select exceptionally good humans. Those not selected are purged.
[k]

＠Gawain
That is all we're trying to do. We act in accordance with our own justice.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Gawain
You decided to reject that. It may have been on the spur of the moment, but still, you denied the Lion King's Holy Selection.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 0.7]

＠Gawain
For the king, one mistake is one too many.[sr]...Thus, you must prepare yourselves.
[k]

＠Gawain
You have[bgm BGM_EVENT_24 0.1] now made enemies of the Lion King, and the Knights of the Round Table.
[k]

＠Gawain
Whether I defeat you now, or another Knight of the Round defeats you later... Either way, your fate is sealed.
[k]

＠Gawain
I have no intention of causing you suffering. Accept your fate, and let this end quickly.
[k]

？1：You don't get to decide!
？2：We won't lose to you!

？！

＠Mash
You're being reckless! That won't do, Master!

＠Gawain
You still don't view me with hostility. Why did you even enter the battlefield with such a mindset?
[k]

＠Gawain
You said you'd defend that child. You defeated the Enforcement Knight who killed his mother out of hatred.
[k]

＠Gawain
Yet you don't exhibit the same hostility toward me. Don't you understand? I am the one who killed that child's mother.
[k]

＠Gawain
I ordered this Holy Punishment. I allowed this slaughter to occur.
[k]

＠Gawain
The Enforcement Knight was simply following orders. The enemy you should hate is me, the commander.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Gawain
Someone who doesn't even understand that shouldn't be on the battlefield! Realize how you insult us by being here!

You're the arrogant one here, Sir Gawain. Individual beliefs and one's actions on the battlefield are two separate things[line 3]

You haven't lost yet. This isn't a matter of sheer power. This is a matter of how one lives their life.

To crush the strong, and aid the weak. That decision is always correct, more than any other.
