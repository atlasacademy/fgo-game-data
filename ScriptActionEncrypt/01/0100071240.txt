Hola! Welcome to my Sun Temple!

＠Quetzalcoatl
I love the way you headed straight here without wasting time, yes! Of course, that's been the case for more than just today, yes!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
You sped all the way here after my attack![sr]It's so exciting, just like I hoped!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
It was worth believing in [%1] and waiting, yes!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Really, I'm glad...
[k]

[charaFace C 6]
＠Quetzalcoatl
I'm glad you didn't waste any time outside of Eridu!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
If you had done something pitiful like that, I would've had to abandon my policy and just kill you all, yes!

＠Quetzalcoatl
All right, let's fight! You've come to defeat me by whatever means necessary, yes?
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
I respect your courage and decisiveness! I shall never back down from any fight, or any challenge!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Quetzalcoatl
That's what I love! Humans are so fun to mess with!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
You can kill them! You can let them live![sr]You can threaten them, or protect them!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
I don't have any memories left from the Cretaceous period, my first generation, but the seeds of information that are generations old tell me this!

[charaFace C 2]
＠Quetzalcoatl
I love you humans. I want to coexist with you.

[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Quetzalcoatl
...But it makes perfect sense, doesn't it?[sr]This is normal in human society, right?
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Purpose isn't just some hobby.[sr]It's what you have to do to live, to be you! Yes!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
I'm a deity who can't exist without messing with humans, and I don't just mean the body of the person who's my host.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
For humanity to survive longer, I need to help some of them, and get rid of others, so they can adapt to their environment.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Performing this cycle is what my life is about.[sr]It's why I exist.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Do you understand? I participated in this trial as one of the three goddesses because I want to play with humanity more.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
As long as I'm here, humanity won't go extinct.[sr]But of course, they won't be safe or at peace either.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Quetzalcoatl
But smile! I will guarantee your freedom![sr]The freedom to run from the threat of yours truly!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
And I will SO enjoy watching you squirm![sr]Like a naughty girl with ants and a magnifying glass!

I'll give your Master a chance, for as long as you can hold me off.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
It can be a game. But first, I have a request.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Quetzalcoatl
[%1], no matter what you fight or how it goes, don't forget to feel joy, yes?
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
I fight because it's fun! Humans fight because it's fun, too!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
If you don't have hatred in your heart, you won't kill your opponent! That's what makes lucha libre so great!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
So you enjoy this danger too, okay?[sr]If you do, we can understand each other more, yes!
