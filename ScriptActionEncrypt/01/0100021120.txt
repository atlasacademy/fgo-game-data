＠Jing Ke
...That's all.[sr]Already, the United Empire is without clear leadership.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
All we encountered are small random[sr]skirmishes with independent enemy units.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Jing Ke
It's safe to assume that the situation looks positive.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Umu! In other words, my army[sr]has regained its true power, right?
[k]

＠Nero
No, I have Mash and the others, as well.[sr]These traitors have no chance against my forces!
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Jing Ke
Carelessness could be fatal, Nero Claudius.[sr]Life can be extinguished without you even knowing it.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Jing Ke
The United Empire defense is still formidable.[sr]That's also why we only run into weaker units.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Nero
U-Umu.[sr]Jing Ke is so cautious.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Jing Ke
Have you forgotten?[sr]I assassinate others for a living.

＠Jing Ke
Plotting is my specialty and at the same time, it's what I'm most wary of.

I believe General Lu Bu was in the rearguard,[sr]Spartacus as well. We can't leave them like that[line 2]

Once the fight starts, those two will probably chase the enemy to the ends of the earth...

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
That's why we placed them in the rearguard.[sr]To capture the capital as planned...but it backfired.

＠Nero
We can't lose those generals! I'm sorry, Mash,[sr][%1], I am counting on you!

Understood. I just need to[sr]stop the rear enemy troops, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
I am relatively good at fighting defensively.[sr]I want to emphasize...'relatively.'
[k]

？1：Let's hurry up!

？！

Yes, Master!
