[line 3]Ahh.[sr]We've successfully teleported this time, Senpai.

The feel of the wind, the scent of earth[line 3][sr]the vast blue sky.
[k]

＠Mash
...It's strange. I've seen it on film so many times,[sr]but just standing here, it's so much more vivid.
[k]

？1：What's wrong? You're breathing deeply.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Huh? Was I? I-I see.[sr]I'm sure I was doing it without thinking.
[k]

？2：So Rayshifting makes you nervous?

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Yes, Rayshifting makes me nervous. But, I don't[sr]think my state of mind has anything to do with that.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
...I mean, I feel overwhelmed.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

In France, it was one shock after another.[sr]So now it's like I'm finally able to face this landscape.

Fou?

？！

＠Fou
Kyu! Kyau!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Looks like Fou will be tagging along again.[sr]He prefers the outside world to that cramped base.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I can agree with that sentiment.
[k]

＠Mash
Battles can be scary, but it makes me happy to discover new worlds like this.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

...But "that" is visible in the sky in this era as well, isn't it?

That ring of light.[sr]It's the same as the one that was over France.
[k]

＠Mash
No, I mean it looks the same.[sr]Not that I've examined it precisely.
[k]

＠Mash
I wonder what it could be?[sr]It's such a huge[line 2]

[wait se ad13]
＠Dr. Roman
Ring of light, huh? As usual, we can't get a good look at it from here.

But it is an intriguing phenomenon.[sr]I will continue to investigate.

By the way, is that... Oh?[sr]Weren't you suppose to be in... Rome?
[k]

？1：Uh, we're in the hills.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
You're right Senpai.[sr]We're in the hills.
[k]

？2：I wonder?

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
No Senpai, I don't believe this is the[sr]ancient Roman capital. We're in the hills.
[k]

？！

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
That's weird, I confirmed it from here as well.[sr]That's not the capital.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
I'm sure that I fixed your teleport position...[sr]Uh, looks like that's a suburb of the Roman capital.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Was there an error in the coordinates?[sr]Is the era correct?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
The era's correct.[sr]Definitely the 1st Century where the singularity exists.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
During the reign of Nero Claudius[line 2][sr]fifth emperor of Rome. That's for certain.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Still, this is strange.[sr]Why are we so far from the capital?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Despite the poisoning of Empress Aggripina last year, Nero isn't in his dangerously declining years yet.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
An era where the emperor is loved, and the city of Rome is prosperous...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...that's what should've been awaiting you.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
No Doctor, it's just rolling hills.[sr]All it needs is some sheep to complete it.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]

There must be some reason for this.[sr]Do you see anything unusual in the surroundings?

？2：Do you hear something?

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes, I think it's the sound of a large battle.[sr]It seems to be coming from over the hill.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
A large battle? A war, maybe?[sr]No, no, no. Impossible.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There were no full-scale wars near the Roman capital in that era.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
That means[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
There's a historical anomaly.[sr]That must be it.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
No doubt about it, they're in combat.[sr]One side is overwhelmingly larger than the other.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
The larger force wears regalia of crimson and gold.[sr]The small wears the same, but a different design.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
[seStop ad16 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Crimson and gold were colors especially liked in Ancient[sr]Rome. Mash, anything else that's distinctive?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
...A woman. Several groups of the[sr]smaller force are being led by a young woman.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
She's practically taking on the enemy forces herself.[sr]The overwhelming avalanche towards the capital, all by herself.
[k]

＠Mash
An extremely strong individual.[sr]A Servant, perhaps.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
No, I am not getting any readings on Servants.[sr]You don't sense it either, do you?
[k]

＠Mash
Correct.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Then it's certain.[sr]That woman is a human of this era.
[k]

＠Mash
This is just personal speculation[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
But she reminds me a bit of Jeanne.[sr]I've no basis for it, though.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Of Jeanne?[sr]The saint who rose to defend the sacred?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Hmmm, who of this era was like that...[sr]I can't think of one. My knowledge is lacking.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
In any case, an impossible war is going on.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Which means[line 2]
[k]

？1：Let's help that woman.

？2：We must stop the city from being overrun.
