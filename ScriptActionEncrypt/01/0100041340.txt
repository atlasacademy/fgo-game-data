＠Mordred
!!!
[k]

＠Mash
...That's...[sr]...No, she is definitely...King Arthur!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
She's absorbing the remaining Demonic Fog as she[sr]manifests! This is bad! There's so much magical energy!
[k]

＠Mash
It looks like she has a spear, not a sword...[sr]A swirling black lance...what twisted magical energy...
[k]

？1：You feel the magical energy?

？2：Wasn't your detection weaker?

？！

＠Mash
Yes, I can tell... Magical energy so big[sr]I can sense it even with Demonic Fog...
[k]

＠Mash
It's similar to when Nikola Tesla manifested.[sr]But it's more clear[line 3]

＠Mash
I can feel her animosity.[sr]It's a blind rage and hatred, like a Berserker!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Is she under the effect of Makiri Zolgen's incantation?[sr]Then even if we can talk to her, we'll still have to fight.

＠Mordred
...We probably can't talk.[sr]That's King Arthur, ready to slay her foes.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
Why... Why are you appearing now? If you're[sr]saving Londinium, you should have come sooner...
[k]

＠Mordred
...No, maybe it's different.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Maybe you're here to kill me.[sr]Do you not like the idea of me saving Londinium?
[k]

＠Mordred
Do you hate me that much?[sr]Is that why you've got the spear that killed me[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The spear that killed Mordred? Th-That's a[sr]Divine Construct, said to rival the holy sword!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Rhongomyniad, the holy spear! The legendary spear[sr]that's said to hold the two sides of the world together!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You already fought one battle with a powerful Servant.[sr]You need to retreat, [%1]!
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
No, not happening.[sr]King Arthur has decided we are enemies.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
There's no getting away.[sr]We have to fight.
[k]

＠Mordred
...No, you can run if you want.[sr]But there's a 90% chance you'll get blown away.
[k]

＠Mordred
Besides, I'm not running.[sr]...I'm not turning my back on my father.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
King Arthur is right in front of me![sr]So there's only one thing for me to do!

I'll rebel against you as many times as I have to![sr][line 3]Arthur Pendragon!

＠Dr. Roman
It's no good! We can't stop Mordred![sr]I guess we have to fight... Good luck, you two!
