Now then, Scáthach. I have a request.[sr]Regardless of whether this world is saved or not[line 2]

＠Li Shuwen
Would you face me at the end?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Scáthach
...Very well.[sr]That is, if I survive until the time comes.

＠Li Shuwen
You don't seem like one who would die so easily.[sr]...Oh right, I have one more thing to tell you.

＠Li Shuwen
This is simply my inference, but it seems the King of Inventions is possessed by something.

If I was in my older body, I may have withered and settled down a bit. But I can't help it, as I was summoned in my physical prime.

Why, fate allowing, we may yet fight alongside each other. Farewell.

...Master, if I may, I believe I should go and see the patient.
[k]

？1：What patient?
？2：Who's that?

？！

＠Nightingale
[line 2]Edison, King of Inventions.
[k]

＠Nightingale
According to what that Servant said,[sr]he is supposedly possessed by something.
[k]

＠Nightingale
...I agree with his opinion.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Even considering my knowledge as a Servant, that being is too foreign in nature to say he's Edison, King of Inventions.
[k]

＠Nightingale
In that case, it must be an illness.[sr]We should meet with him again.

I guess it's my intuition as a Servant...[sr]I feel like we can't leave him like this.
