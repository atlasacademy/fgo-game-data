Oof... Don't glare at me like that. I regret that I went a[sr]little overboard. You seriously look scary right now.

＠Mordred
So, how was it, Mash? Figured out how to use that[sr]Noble Phantasm at least a little bit?
[k]

＠Mash
Yes... Thank you... Very much...[sr]Somehow, it feels[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...like a shackle on my heart was removed... That was[sr]the toughest I've felt since Cú Chulainn's spells...
[k]

？1：Then perhaps...that just now was?

？！

＠Mordred
...Well, drastic times call for drastic measures.
[k]

＠Mordred
She was holding herself back[sr]by calling herself a Demi-Servant.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
I pulled a stunt here to hammer into her what her role[sr]was. She'll be a bit more decent from now on.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Mordred...
[k]

？1： You look after others well.

？2：...Even so, a bit too rough...

？！

[charaFace E 3]
＠Mordred
Shut up. You guys drop your guard way too much[sr]and it was pissing me off, that's all.
[k]

＠Mordred
It's not like me to teach swordsmanship to others.[sr]In fact, this was my first time. Damn you!
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Listen. Not a word of this to Jekyll.[sr]He'll interrogate me again.
[k]

＠Mordred
And sorry, [%1]. I apologize for[sr]disrespecting you. You are indeed weak, but it's a practical kind of weak.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mordred
You're no coward nor scoundrel. You're an idiot worth[sr]carrying, in your own way. Right, Mash?
[k]

＠Mash
Yes, definitely![sr]After all, Senpai is the best Master in Chaldea!
[k]

？1：Thanks, Mash.

？2：Best in Chaldea is saying too much...

？！

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
Okay, okay, enough already. This is so sweet[sr]I'm getting indigestion.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
All right, time to hurry onward, [%1],[sr]Mash. Keep that shield at the ready and follow me.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Okay![sr]Thank you very much, kind Sir Mordred!
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Mordred
D-Don't suddenly start calling me "Sir Mordred," dummy![sr]You're gonna make me trip!
