＠Holmes
...Hm. [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1], having watched two of your battles, may I comment on your leadership?
[k]

？1：Yes.
？2：No.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Holmes
Hahaha, how unfortunate! You seem to know less about me than Ms. Kyrielight!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Sherlock Holmes cannot be silenced, has no self-restraint, and doesn't care about bothering others!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Holmes
I always voice my own deductions!
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
Anyway, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].[sr]To be honest, I'm quite surprised.
[k]

＠Holmes
Your fighting abilities are unbelievable, but they're still only secondary to something else.
[k]

＠Holmes
The root of your strength lies in the style of your contracts.
[k]

＠Holmes
I'm sure there's no precedent in history of a Master with connections to so many Servants.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
An even more shocking aspect is the length of time that this has continued.
[k]

＠Holmes
Normally, Servants are only summoned temporarily, and only for a particular battle.
[k]

＠Holmes
Perpetual contracts like your own are unthinkable.[sr]Yet it doesn't seem like you have any particular secrets, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
In other words...
[k]


？1：...In other words what? (Gulp)

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
...By the way, Ms. Kyrielight. It would appear you still don't have full control of your Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Holmes
Why is that? Is it something beyond your means?
[k]

？1：You changed the subject!?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Holmes
Hahaha. Hahahahahahaha.
[k]

？2：Mash doesn't know its True Name...

？！

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 4]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Mash
...Yes. I still don't know the True Name of the Heroic Spirit who transferred this power to me...
[k]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Holmes
That's not it. The True Name isn't a big issue.[sr]You've simply erred on which foot to set forth on.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Holmes
But be at ease. You will have the solution soon.[sr]Given the information, there's nothing I can't uncover.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
...No, that was rude of me. That sounded like bragging. There are some things that even I don't know.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Right now, we're fighting with another mystery: the true identity of the King of Mages, the culprit behind the Incineration of Humanity.
[k]

＠Holmes
I have almost no information about him.
[k]

＠Holmes
Every corner of time has his tracks, but none of these seem to tie to King Solomon.
[k]

＠Holmes
If someone had seen the King of Mages firsthand,[sr]I could've asked if there was any resemblance to Solomon.
[k]

＠Holmes
But of course there wouldn't be such a convenient witness. I have no choice but to continue inferring from information.
[k]

？1：Uh... I've seen the King of Mages.
？2：Um... I know the King of Mages.

？！

[charaFace D 2]
＠Holmes
You were such a vital witness!?[sr]Then please, tell me everything!
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
What did he look like? His voice? His magical lineage?[sr]And most importantly[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
What are your impressions, having directly met him?
[k]

＠Holmes
Any discomfort? Anything out of place? A sense of discomfort would be the most important key.
[k]

＠Holmes
Try to remember, no matter how trivial it may seem.[sr]Was there anything strange about the King of Mages?
[k]


？1：...I remember what he looks like, but...

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 7]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Mash
So do I, but I'm not able to share those memories with you... The recordings are all covered in static too...
[k]


？2：...Now that I think about it...

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Is there something?
[k]

？！


？1：...One thing about his appearance...
？2：...Something seemed to be missing...

？！

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Holmes
...Something missing... Missing, you say? For a human who had never seen the King of Mages before to say such a thing...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
He must've made an oversight, trivial though it may be. An oversight that, though unintentional, was enough to arouse suspicion.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
...Ms. Kyrielight. I'm sorry, but could you draw a sketch as we walk?
[k]

＠Holmes
I'd like a picture of the King of Mages you saw. Normally, you'd be cursed for even making an attempt,
[k]

＠Holmes
but here in Atlas, they likely have perfect measures against outside curses. No harm would come to you.
[k]

[charaTalk A]

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Mash
I understand. I'm no artist, but I'll try to draw what we saw.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...And may I also say something, Mr. Holmes?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
I didn't sense any sort of discomfort like my Master did, but...
[k]

＠Mash
What the King of Mages said, how he acted... It wasn't consistent. That was what seemed out of place to me.
[k]

＠Mash
He was sometimes violent, sometimes calm... even totally indifferent toward us at times.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...The changes all seemed abrupt to me...
[k]

Hm. Tell me in more detail. What kind of conversation did you have with him?

＠Holmes
[line 3]I see. Thank you, Ms. Kyrielight.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Holmes
That was very useful information. Enough to inch a little closer to the true identity of the King of Mages.

＠Mash
Y-You're welcome... I'm glad I could help.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
Guessing from your conversation, the King of Mages is akin to a mirror.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
A mirror...?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Correct. A mirror reflects those standing before it. A mirror that shows the nature of the person speaking to it.
[k]

＠Holmes
If someone vulgar speaks, he answers just as rudely...
[k]

＠Holmes
While if someone wise speaks, he answers with equal earnestness.
[k]

＠Holmes
He responds to the cruel with cruelty, and to the calm with benevolence.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Holmes
It's not that he lacks his own sense of self, or that he has multiple personality disorder...
[k]

＠Holmes
He's just not confined to one single alignment.[sr]No, it's the exact opposite, in fact. That's his nature.
[k]

？1：I see. Mordred was crude, so...
？2：I see. Andersen was mean, so...

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
But he said he isn't interested in us.[sr]He said life has no value.
[k]

＠Mash
I don't think anybody who was present thought that way.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
...That's exactly it. That's the part I find frightening,[sr]Ms. Kyrielight.

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Holmes
No interest in humans... That is the truth for the King of Mages.
[k]

＠Holmes
As proof, he has already destroyed humanity.[sr]He's unlike the Lion King, who seeks to destroy this era.
[k]

＠Holmes
He has already won, which is precisely why he has shown his true form.
[k]

＠Holmes
Of course he would have no interest in us. It's because he has already moved on to his next project.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Holmes
For example, suppose there's a desk here with a project labeled “Incineration of Humanity” sitting on top of it.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
He finished that project long ago. Now he's at a different desk, ready to start anew.
[k]

＠Holmes
Normally, that would be the end. Humanity wouldn't even have the option of fighting against him.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
However, a miracle occurred. It goes without saying, but that miracle was Chaldea.
[k]

＠Holmes
Although it's simply a miniscule space remaining at the now uninhabited desk.
[k]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 0]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Mash
...To the King of Mages, incinerating humanity is already a finished project... You're saying that's why he has no interest in us?
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Holmes
Yes. To be precise, it's because he's occupied with his next task.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Holmes
What frightens me is... the true nature of that “next task.”
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Listen well. You can say that this case was the perfect crime.
[k]

＠Holmes
Nobody could prevent the plot from occurring. We were completely defeated, unable to even make a move.
[k]

＠Holmes
A detective works after an incident occurs...[sr]After there are already victims.
[k]

＠Holmes
Even if I deduce the truth behind the incident, I don't have the power to undo what has taken place.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
...But you do, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].[sr]You have that power.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
The King of Mages doesn't believe so... Which is your one and only chance to overcome that demon's crime.
