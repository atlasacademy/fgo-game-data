＠Mash
So this is Mt. Ebih... Looking up from the base, it seems steeper than the other mountains.
[k]

＠Mash
But it looks like proper paths have been built.[sr]I was expecting to have to climb up sheer cliffs.

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah. Mt. Ebih was the tallest magical summit[line 2]or rather, spiritual mountain[line 2]in Sumer.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even An, the greatest of the Sumerian gods, feared it. His daughter Inanna was obsessed with it, however, and to her he said this:
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
“Ebih is a fertile mountain. Its blessings are great, and it is deep.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
“My dear Inanna. Only a fool would disobey Mt. Ebih.”
[k]

＠Merlin
Yes. And that warning angered Inanna[line 2]that is, Ishtar[line 2]even more.
[k]

＠Merlin
Ishtar took all her weapons, and headed for Mt. Ebih, bringing a storm behind her.
[k]

＠Merlin
She tore apart the mountain as she walked along its edge towards its center.
[k]

＠Merlin
Of course, it was a spiritual mountain that even the gods feared. Ferocious creatures, volcanoes, rivers, and cold winds struck at her.

＠Ana
And each time, Ishtar complained.
[k]

＠Ana
“Toxic mist, raining boulders, burning lava![sr]I can't believe it! What kind of welcome is this?”
[k]

＠Ana
In her mind, the fact that she was the one trying to destroy the mountain didn't matter at all. She is mankind's oldest example of victim-blaming!

＠Dr. Roman
Mt. Ebih's mistake is that it didn't send all its disasters at once. It kept hoping the next thing it did would get her to leave.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It sent its storms out bit by bit. Now, Ishtar was selfish, but adversity only made her stronger.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
At last she reached the top of Mt. Ebih,
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
“And the goddess grabbed Mt. Ebih by the neck, and stabbed her blade deep into its body.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
“Mt. Ebih fell apart, its huge body sliding down like a drop of water.”
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Mt. Ebih collapsed to half its original size, and Ishtar's aspect as a goddess of war became common knowledge.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
What's interesting is that through all that, Ishtar didn't use her bow.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In fact, she took the trouble to walk all the way up to the summit and drive a lance into it.
[k]

？1：She... She walked...
？2：Drove... her lance...

？！

...I know it's too late, but I'm a little worried.[sr]Can we really talk to a goddess like that?

＠Merlin
Well, let's believe in King Gilgamesh's secret plan.[sr]He's probably feeling overwhelmingly low about now...
[k]

？1：I wish he'd negotiate himself...

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Merlin
That's a bad idea. Ishtar would never agree to King Gilgamesh's demands.
[k]

＠Merlin
He can't neglect his kingly duties, anyway. Not because of psychological reasons, but from the sheer amount of work.
[k]

＠Merlin
He's handling the leadership and military command of not only Uruk, but all of Mesopotamia.
[k]

＠Merlin
There's also preparations to be made for when the Northern Wall falls, and when Gorgon attacks.
[k]

＠Merlin
There's not much hope to get his help in battle during this Singularity. Even now, he's more at risk of dying from overwork than he would be in battle.

＠Dr. Roman
That's true... I keep forgetting, but King Gilgamesh is from this era.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He's got a vast amount of magical energy, but he's not as sturdy as a Servant. We can't put him through too much.

Yes, yes. It's a very serious “too many kings” problem.

＠Dr. Roman
Anyway, guys, enemies sighted!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They're probably demonic statues placed by Ishtar to guard the mountain.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Each one has the magical energy of an A-ranked Servant! Stay sharp and engage them!
