...So you've finally come.[sr]I was getting pretty sick of waiting, you idiots.
[k]

＠Boy
Thanks to you, I've ended up reading an entire novel[sr]series, roughly 20 volumes, that I didn't even want to read.
[k]

？1：Who's this?

？2：A child?

You're the rescue team Mr. Henry Jekyll said was[sr]coming? Then, let me quickly fill you in on the situation here.

＠Mash
This boy, as it were.[sr]He must have some relation to this antique bookshop.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Maybe he's the shopkeeper's son or relative...[sr]or grandson. Is that correct?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
You're the one who contacted Mr. Jekyll,[sr]and are seeking help from us, right?
[k]

＠Boy
Yes, that's right. The situation being what it is,[sr]a rough understanding is fine for now.

You kind of...have a really nice voice.[sr]Is your voice changing right now?
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Boy
Yeah, I've always wanted to be in theaters.
[k]

＠Boy
So embarrassing. Nothing more embarrassing than[sr]a life where you couldn't achieve what you want!
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Boy
Well, we'll put talk of my beautiful voice aside.[sr]I'll be talking your ears off from here, anyway.
[k]

＠Boy
For now, let's talk about "this place." The Magical Tome[sr]already assaulted the elderly shopkeeper here.
[k]

＠Boy
Nearly half of Soho's people met the same fate. They've[sr]fallen into unending slumber, and now dream merrily together.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Do you know where the Magical Tome is now?[sr]Also, how did you manage to escape its attack?
[k]

＠Boy
Huh? Are you stupid? Is your brain, not just your voice,[sr]in la-la land? Obviously, I ran away from it!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Huh? ...Oh! Um, s-sorry... Of course...[sr]That makes perfect sense... Ha, ha, sorry... I apologize...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Ha, ha...[sr]Ha, ha, ha...

Doctor, please don't get hurt by a child's words.[sr]Kids that age tend to speak very bluntly.

So, you asked where the Magical Tome is.[sr]Right here.

It's on the 2nd floor residence of the bookshop...[sr]In other words, still on this floor, in the study next door.

Senpai, indoor combat is dangerous. We should avoid[sr]combat in narrow, enclosed spaces if we can.
[k]

＠Mash
There is a chance that you and the boy[sr]would get caught up in the fight.
[k]

？1：Then let's fight in an open space.

？2：Lure it outside!

？！

[charaFace A 7]
