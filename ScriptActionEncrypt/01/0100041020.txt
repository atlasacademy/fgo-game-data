＠Mash
Good morning, Senpai.[sr]Did you sleep well?
[k]

＠Mash
It seems like you went by yourself[sr]to the nap room a little earlier...
[k]

？1：I couldn't sleep much.

？2：Those author Heroic Spirits were there...

？！

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
Oh...um, that's right...[sr]The two Heroic Spirit authors are occupying that room...
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
In that case, you probably didn't get much rest.[sr]I-I'm sorry I didn't notice.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I...wish I had let you use[sr]the sofa in the living room that was assigned to me...
[k]

？1：It's okay.

？2：I'm glad it worked out this way.

？！

Come to think of it...[sr]Oh! Senpai, maybe Fran...
[k]

？1：In the next room.

？2：In the authors' room.

？！

[charaFace E 3]
＠Mordred
...Well, if she's fine with that, it's fine.[sr]I myself have no intention of entering that room.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
That room gives off a kind of odd ambience. I wonder[sr]if that's the power of authors with looming deadlines.

＠Mordred
They've basically just been writing since materializing.[sr]Though I'm not sure if Andersen is really working or not.

I couldn't help but sense a strange pressure coming from that room...

Charles Babbage, right? He was an outstanding British[sr]scientist and mathematician of the 19th century.

I'm sure that he and the original Dr. Victor Frankenstein[sr]were acquaintances.

Babbage was supposed to have passed away[sr]at least a decade prior to our present time.

[charaFace G 1]

Huh? No, that's strange. He may be old, but he should[sr]still be an active scholar in good health.

Of course. I came across his name while perusing this[sr]year's Royal Society Almanac. Victor also spoke of him.

＠Jekyll
So I can't imagine he's dead. His inventions were[sr]featured in newspapers from last year and this year, too.

＠Dr. Roman
I can think of two possibilities.[sr]One is that our historical records do not match reality.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Another is that a "shift" of events has occurred.[sr]That, in fact, has occurred in all the previous eras.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Orleans, Rome, even Okeanos.[sr]The events were all slightly distorted and "shifted."
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Due to events changing, the dead are still alive[sr]and not there as Heroic Spirits[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's possible. The same applies to those[sr]who died from the Demonic Fog.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It may be that 20th century events have shifted[sr]all the way into this era.

We can't rule it out.[sr]So who belongs to this era, and who doesn't?

[communicationCharaFace 4]

It's extremely difficult to determine. Especially when[sr]there are no records left in existence[line 3]

It's bad news from my information network.[sr]Saber, this concerns you too.

All the Helter Skelters that had been[sr]completely shut down[line 3]have reactivated.

Yeah. There's no way we can let the enemy[sr]procure any other Servants that materialize from the fog.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Mash, [%1], I'm counting on you.[sr]Make sure you stop the Helter Skelters for good this time!
