＠Olga Marie
Okay[line 3]Oh for God's sake, what is happening?[sr]Why are Servants here?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I see... A Holy Grail War?[sr]A Holy Grail War was going on in that town!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Normally, it would be a battle royale amongst the Seven[sr]Servants summoned in Fuyuki. But something's gone terribly wrong.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm not surprised there's a Servant without a Master.[sr]It's natural for Servants to target other Servants.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
Then as long as I'm here, we'll be targeted by other Servants?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Olga Marie
But Mash has nothing to do with the Grail![sr]That's just a wandering phantom gone mad!
