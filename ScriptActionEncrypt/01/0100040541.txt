[line 3]Now then.[sr]I suppose I should die by your hands here as well.

Teleportation[line 3][sr]If it wasn't caused by the use of a Command Spell, it's...

＠Mash
It's a skill closer to True Magic.[sr]With the way he did it... A possibility is the Holy Grail...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's possible. He did say that he was one of the people[sr]behind Project Demonic Fog trying to destroy this era.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's also possible that the owner of the Holy Grail[sr]teleported him away as well.
[k]
