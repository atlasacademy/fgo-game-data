＠Scáthach
Hm... Shadow Servants have appeared. That Medb seems to understand how to use the Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Scáthach
These are wraiths that couldn't become Servants.[sr]They are one step shy of becoming heroes.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Or they are Heroic Spirits that became shadows due to the summoners' lack of ability, improper summoning circles, etc.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Thus, you could say they're beings closest to Servants. Make sure to defeat them. Humans stand no chance against them.

...A Servant. However, not a Celtic one. He seems to be from near my country... Chinese perhaps?

He doesn't look like an enemy.[sr]But...is he...an ally?

[line 2]Regardless, his technique is quite impressive.

＠Scáthach
Abilities like that are impossible without both innate talent and hellish training to forge one's body.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Scáthach
...Excellent. Most excellent.[sr]It makes me itch for a good fight.

Still... I can't help it.[sr]I'm filled with selfishness, after all.

Lancer, Li Shuwen.[sr]If this was the Land of Shadows, I'd train you right away.

＠Scáthach
However, I belong to [%1]'s cause already. Thus, things must be done in order.
[k]

＠Scáthach
First fight Mash, and win.[sr]If you do, I, Scáthach, shall face you directly.

[charaFace A 5]

However, if defeated, you must be gone immediately.
