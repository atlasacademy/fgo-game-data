Sir Lancelot, we've tracked down the enemies.[sr]Shall we wait for the third wave?

No, we attack.
[k]

＠Lancelot
Split the third wave horizontally. Have them surround the refugees while we're in combat.
[k]

＠Lancelot
Our orders are to capture the rebels.[sr]If they do not resist, there is no need to fight them.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Lancelot
Do you understand? This is not the king's orders, but Agravain's. There's no need to work so hard.
[k]

＠Lancelot
Sir Agravain has stated he cannot give us clearance to set foot in the Holy City before this mission is complete.

Unbelievable[line 3]

A pathetic trifle, a petty scheme.[sr]Let us quickly deal with this and return to the Holy City.

Understood! Let our flag bear the pride of the King of Knights!

Pity. I'd have let you deal with it if that Round Table knight was alone.

＠Da Vinci
Hm? This thing?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The new and improved ornithopter, now with my magical energy collection device in its core... I call it Sphinx Megiddo!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Basically a self-propelling bomb that charges and explodes in the enemy camp. Its only flaw is the lack of autopilot.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This should clear those guys out. So, [%1], you go with the refugees.

Oh, come on, Da Vinci. You make it sound like you're going to pilot that thing or something!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This thing's got it, right? An autopilot?[sr]I mean, wouldn't that be easier than making a bomb?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
Well, I call it a bomb, but it basically uses my staff and my magical circuits to self-destruct.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This tactic requires me to be the one driving. That's why there was never a need to develop an autopilot.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 2]
＠Dr. Roman
Are you insane!?[sr]We can't let you do that!
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Da Vinci
Now, now... I had predicted this before we reached the Holy City, when we saw that redheaded knight. We can't help it.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If they catch up to us, this is the only way we can escape.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So, well, personally, it's nothing much.[sr]Like, my turn has finally come.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Da Vinci
Right, Romani? Servants are actually disposable.[sr]You use them for a day or two, and then get rid of them.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I just happened to be around a little longer.[sr]Maybe too long, if you ask me.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]

I'm leaving the rest up to you. For a chicken, you actually made it this far, right?

No. I will be fine, but you will not be able to catch up. Such is the flaw of heavy armor. We need cavalry to traverse this area.

Send word to the fort to our west, and replenish our cavalry. Do not forget to find a guide that knows the mountains well.
