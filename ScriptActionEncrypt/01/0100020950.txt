Anyway, when I materialized in this world[sr]I dragged these two with me.

[charaFace E 4]
＠Stheno
I didn't feel like I'd be able to complete the Heroes' Cave on my own.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Stheno
So I had these two serve as my testers for the cave, that's all I think?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Elisabeth
Hmph, it was a totally boring dungeon.[sr]Oh, but a live show in an underground cave is a new concept, right?

I am Tamamo Cat, one of the Tamamo Nine!

＠Tamamo Cat
I tag "woof" at the end of my sentences. My hobby is[sr]cafe management. My favorite food is carrots.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

Hmm.[sr]That's pretty inconsistent even for me. Woof woof.

Hehe! Your reaction was better than I thought.[sr]It requires technique to communicate with her.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Stheno
Thank you, Tamamo Cat.[sr]But why weren't you in the treasure chest?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Stheno
You were supposed to be the last trick. After they[sr]dealt with the chimera, you should've come out.
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠Tamamo Cat
Now I'll get my carrots as the reward!
[k]

Oh, well. Though this island has been somewhat fun,[sr]I guess we came here for nothing.

Ahahaha! It happens! Don't look so depressed.[sr]Why don't we return to Rome for now[line 2]
