That's right. Die here. Die like the insects you are.

Those who survive on the battlefield. Those who forget it. Those who avoid the battlefield. Those who abandoned me there...

All of them must die. I'll kill them. I'll kill you. I'll kill every single human.

＠Dr. Roman
She's multiplying. Just like the Lahmu! I...don't think this new Ushiwakamaru can die!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As long as a finger or single strand of hair survives, a new Ushiwakamaru will grow from it!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This is the worst! There's nothing we can do! [%1], run!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even if you had a Noble Phantasm that could completely obliterate it, that thing won't stay dead!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Because...Ushiwakamaru's Spirit Origin signature is mixed in with the sea behind her!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's literally no end to this!

I did tell you... I'm going to kill you.

＠Ushiwakamaru
The only Noble Phantasm that could destroy this sea would be one capable of gathering all the magical energy of the entire era.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
In other words, only the light bands covering the heavens can rival Mother now. Do any of you have such a powerful Noble Phantasm?
