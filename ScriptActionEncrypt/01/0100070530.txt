...? Everyone got quiet when you entered the forest. What's wrong?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I mean, it's a dense forest, so I know you're worried about getting lost, but...
[k]


？1：It's SUPER hot!

I know how Ana feels... I underestimated this as well...

The heat rising up from the ground, the strong smell of dirt, the cries of the animals that are sure to drive you crazy...
[k]

＠Mash
So this is...what they call a jungle...
[k]

Was this what Earth was like 65 million years ago, just before the asteroid hit?

It's no exaggeration! This is terrible! The heat! So many flies! And it's so hard to walk!

And this Ether is incredible! Much denser than the Isle of Britain!

Romani, are you monitoring the density of magical energy? It's on par with a Reality Marble!

It's like Egypt. This is a different world, or rather, the mythological system itself is different.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I can only do so much by pointing Sheba towards Uruk. I can't distinguish heat sources, let alone details of your surroundings.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You'll have to rely on your senses. Utilize your eyes and noses to detect danger.
[k]

I'm sorry... The problem is the sea of trees there. If there were fewer of them, I could help, but...
[k]

？2：...Eyes, sure. But nose...?
[communicationCharaFace 1]

＠Da Vinci
Yup. In a jungle, your sense of smell is an important source of information. It tells you the past better than any echolocators.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The smell of an animal lingers in an area. If you could visualize it as a number, you could easily deduce what, when, and where it went.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's not only animals that hunt by sense of smell.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Humans can use their brains to do something similar.

According to the map, Ur is one kilometer south. That means we only have to endure this heat for another 20 minutes, Master.

Next time you want to enter the jungle, give money to a local, and lower your head to the ground and say this:

“Buenas noches, señorita! Señor, señor, do you want some peyote?”
