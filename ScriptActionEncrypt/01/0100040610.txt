＠Andersen
I'm glad to see you back.[sr]A shame about the officers at the Yard.
[k]

＠Andersen
Rest for a little.[sr]I heard you haven't rested at all since your arrival, right?
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
Pushing yourself doesn't equate to good work. Be it[sr]writing or hunting for the Holy Grail, occasional breaks are needed.

Thank you.[sr]But...there's no time.
[k]

＠Andersen
Fool. Are you a workaholic, too?[sr]Can you not forget the weight of what you carry?
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
Then let me tell you a story to pass the time.[sr]A story of how Nursery Rhyme and I materialized.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Um...you mean Alice, right?[sr]That's what she called herself...
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
No, Nursery Rhyme.[sr]You left for the Yard before I could tell you.
[k]

＠Andersen
I didn't get to say this, but both Nursery Rhyme and I[sr]appeared "from the demonic fog."
[k]

＠Andersen
With no Master,[sr]and no summoning ritual, either.

＠Mordred
Yeah, so was I, come to think of it.[sr]Jekyll's no Master, and there was no summoning ritual.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
I just woke up one moment in the fog.[sr]Huh, do Servants just naturally appear like that?
[k]

？1：Maybe they do.

＠Dr. Roman
No, no, no![sr]That's impossible!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If you can just appear... No, be summoned on your own,[sr]you're something way more powerful than a Servant!
[k]

？2：I don't know about that...

[charaFadeout E 0.1]
[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 7]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Mash
Yes, it's normally impossible.
[k]

＠Mash
If you mean[line 3]naturally appearing Heroic Spirits,[sr]there aren't many, but there are a few such records.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
But when that happens,[sr]they don't have a personality of their own.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
When a Heroic Spirit appears as a Servant,[sr]they're always summoned from the Throne by a ritual.
[k]

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Listen, in the other three eras we went to, the Servants[sr]were always summoned under the Grail's influence.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's absolutely impossible[sr]for a Servant to just appear on its own!

＠Andersen
So the Servants aren't appearing from the fog, then?[sr]That leaves one possibility.
[k]

＠Andersen
The fog was "created by the Holy Grail."[sr]Or, what creates the fog is influenced by the Holy Grail.

That's...what it would mean.[sr]That's the logical conclusion. No contradictions.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
Logic applies to most things in the real world.[sr]About the only thing it doesn't apply to is love.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
Use your imagination. Then, you'll anticipate[sr]most things, and sometimes even predict them.

Haha. Love?[sr]Like you'd know, you punk.
[k]

＠Andersen
I don't want to hear that from a kid who doesn't even[sr]know love. I'm a virgin. I know all about love and romance.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
...Huh? Hmm. Huh?[sr]That doesn't make sense, does it? Hmm?
[k]

？1：I don't know, but those are amazing words.

？2：Hmm? It's true, it doesn't...

？！

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
Have you forgotten? I am Andersen.[sr]My storytelling makes me a Caster Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Andersen
If a swordsman's skills lie in battle, an author's[sr]skills lie in letters, words, indolence, pain, and love.
[k]

＠Andersen
Be it improv poetry or a crazy deadline,[sr]a true author is capable of anything when serious.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
I am a creative author.[sr]Not many can match me for imagination.
[k]

＠Andersen
I won't lose a debate to an amateur.[sr]If you're not going to rest, go for a late-night patrol.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
Yeah. You're right! If we can nab that "P"[sr]and make him talk, we can end this.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
I'm going for a patrol then.[sr]I'll take a walk to the edge of the city area.

＠Jekyll
You're good at manipulating people, huh?[sr]But thanks, they were under a lot of strain.
[k]

＠Andersen
It's nothing[sr]compared to writing a moving story.
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Andersen
I just had to "motivate" them.[sr]...But I don't understand.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Jekyll
Hmm?
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
What I showed them may be an illusion. A wisp within a[sr]match light. Logical or not, it's no different from a fantasy.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Jekyll
You just used your imagination, right?[sr]So[line 3]
[k]

＠Andersen
Don't be stupid.[sr]That was just a "play" on words.
