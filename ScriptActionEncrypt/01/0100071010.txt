I've gone through your report.[sr]You have been through a lot, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Gilgamesh
Sacrifices are unavoidable in war.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
As king, I will prepare the memorial for the lost, and compensate those left behind. None of you need worry about that.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Gilgamesh
Gorgon, wielder of the Authority of Tiamat, will begin attacking in ten days! Are you certain, Merlin!?

＠Merlin
It's been a day since then, so nine days to be correct. First, let's review what we know.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Merlin
Gorgon, the monster known for killing heroes in Greek mythology.
[k]

＠Merlin
She's here either because of the King of Mages' Holy Grail or due to some twist of fate.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Merlin
Whichever it is, the Grail has restored her former appearance and power.
[k]

＠Merlin
While many legends tell of the monstrous Gorgon Sisters' murderous exploits, none depict any of them giving birth to other monsters.
[k]

＠Merlin
Therefore, the Authority to give birth to Demonic Beasts, Potnia Theron, must have come from the Holy Grail.
[k]

？1：Who are the Gorgon Sisters?

[charaFadeout C 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Three deities in Greek mythology: Stheno, the oldest; Euryale, the middle sister; and Medusa, the youngest.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
They used to be rural goddesses, but the youngest Medusa angered the great goddess Athena of Olympus.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In her wrath, Athena transformed Medusa into a monster. Medusa's sisters took pity on her, and together the three moved to a remote island called the Shapeless Isle.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
However, the people, influenced by Athena, saw all three sisters only as monsters. So, they sought to kill them.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
After defeating many heroes who came to kill both her and her sisters, Medusa truly became the monster everyone believed she was. She even devoured her beloved sisters.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's probably how this “Gorgon Monster” was born. It's a manifestation of the primordial goddess that possesses the divinity of the three sisters.
[k]

[communicationCharaClear]
[wait communicationChara]

？2：Does that have anything to do with Stheno and Euryale?

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 0]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Mash
Yes. There were three divine Gorgon Sisters in Greek mythology; those two were the oldest and middle sisters.
[k]

＠Mash
The youngest sister, Medusa, was persecuted by the people, killing many heroes who came for her head.
[k]

＠Mash
The ceaseless violence, the prejudice and persecution all drove her mad, and eventually she devoured her beloved sisters and became an enormous monster.

Humph. So an exiled goddess returns as a goddess of vengeance, huh?

＠Gilgamesh
If anything, I'd say she should destroy the Greek world instead, but I'm sure that would be a bitter pill to swallow even for her.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Gilgamesh
Then? Did Gorgon say humans have no chance against the goddesses from the very beginning?
[k]

[charaFadeout F 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 4]

Hahaha! Of course you do! Strife among enemies is the most entertaining weakness there is!
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

But aren't you quite nasty yourself, [%1]? You'd better take a long look in the mirror if you ever want to make any friends!

[charaFace F 2]
＠Gilgamesh
Curses, so you're some little Goody Two-shoes![sr]Sit right there. I shall educate you in the art of ruling and dominating your foes!
[k]

？！

[charaFace F 5]
＠Gilgamesh
According to your research, the three goddesses are each very different.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Gorgon has the greatest influence, and runs on the hatred of humans.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Although the Goddess of the Jungle has covered Ur and Eridu with greenery, she has not done anything to the people.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Also, this goddess isn't particularly assertive.[sr]She has no hatred, but she is not lazy either.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
She uses what's necessary when necessary and carefully reads the situation. She's perhaps the most perfected goddess of all.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Gilgamesh
The third goddess is the one hard at work destroying her own land of Mesopotamia...
[k]

？1：Ishtar...

[charaFace F 3]
＠Gilgamesh
...Hm. Well, that sounds about right.
[k]

？2：...

[charaFace F 0]
＠Gilgamesh
Oh? The look on your face is saying Ishtar is not a foe.[sr]It is fine, do not mind me.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
If you feel that way, you may be right. She wasn't taken into consideration in the first place anyway.
[k]

？！

[charaFace F 1]
＠Gilgamesh
Well, there is no point in highlighting that woman's faults now. I'm tired of it anyway.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
What I want to point out is the order in which we defeat them. Negotiating with Gorgon is not possible, but the other two are different.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Which means Ishtar should be first.[sr]That should be the most manageable opponent.

My king, are you commanding us to defeat Ishtar? I cannot agree to that.
[k]

＠Siduri
No matter how much damage Ishtar causes, she is still Uruk's patron deity. To fight her would be...
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Gilgamesh
How disappointing, Siduri... Even [%1] understands...
[k]

＠Siduri
Huh...? U-um, what do you mean by “understands”...?
[k]

？1：Ishtar is bad, but she's a good goddess.
？2：Ishtar is a pain, but she's not a bad goddess.

Yes... All of the victims' stories agree that Ishtar always and only attacked when there were Demonic Beasts involved.

In light of that, we believe she was trying to protect the farms from the Demonic Beasts.

[charaEffect F bit_talk_41]

And of course, that means that our heroic[sr][%1] shall be that beast tamer!

[%1] can contract with her.[sr]I don't have particularly high hopes for her.

＠Gilgamesh
However, her Bull of Heaven, Gugalanna, is another matter entirely.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
It's a lethal weapon that, if used, could incinerate a city in an instant. We will definitely need that to end this war.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Therefore, we will make her our ally.[sr]Do you have anything to say, Merlin?
