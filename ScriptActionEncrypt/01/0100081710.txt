The drama your daily lives portray is always real. It is a great show without a single lie and without any hope.

From an arrogant dictatorship that swallows up many lives, to a momentary isolation that ends all alone...

＠Demon God Bael
O king. My king. Our temple is being invaded.
[k]

＠Demon God Bael
Was the Master of Chaldea not the only target?[sr]What is this situation? What is this chaos?
[k]

＠Demon God Bael
This savagery is not within our plan.[sr]We need to find a countermeasure immediately.
[k]

＠Demon God Bael
At this rate, the throne's protection will be lost.[sr]It will interfere with the king's work.
[k]

＠Demon God Bael
Our purpose does not allow any mistake. The design of the new life does not allow the slightest distortion.
[k]

＠Demon God Bael
The work of the king must be done in silence.[sr]However, we cannot hold back the Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Demon God Bael
My king. Allow us the use of the Third Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Demon God Bael
We should incinerate those Heroic Spirits with Ars Almadel Salomonis's bands of light.

...What an ugly sight.[sr]Truly ugly to see. Do you not think so, Bael?
[k]

＠Solomon
Any Heroic Spirit would have known our purpose the moment they set foot into this temple.
[k]

＠Solomon
The bands of light are the way of balancing old Humanity. To reach a better truth.
[k]

＠Solomon
But even knowing that, they still attack us.[sr]Unbelievable[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Solomon
Truly, they are but scum with rotten brains![sr]Fools who are Heroic Spirits in name only!
[k]

＠Solomon
No matter how much humans claim to have advanced, they themselves are the proof of humanity's limits!

Then let us, the Gazing Stars, use the bands of light.[sr]We shall purge the Heroic Spirits.

＠Solomon
[line 3]What are you worried about? That is not like you, Bael. And you call yourself one of the 72 Demon Gods?
[k]

＠Solomon
Even if you incinerate those Heroic Spirits, as long as “that” exists, they will endlessly reappear.
[k]

＠Solomon
You only need to kill the one.
[k]

＠Solomon
Servants are but familiars summoned by humans.[sr]That flaw cannot be changed by sheer numbers.
[k]

＠Solomon
Let them fight until they are satisfied.[sr]This is their final battle, after all.
[k]

＠Solomon
Annoying though it may be, go and attend to the fools.

But we too feel the unbearable pain of death.[sr]Will not the death of terminals impact the throne?

＠Solomon
That is your problem. As long as I, Solomon, exist, the 72 Demon Gods are indestructible.
[k]

＠Solomon
Even if a few pillars perish from the pains of death, they will be immediately replaced.
[k]

＠Solomon
Defeat is not possible for us, Bael. Slaughter Heroic Spirits by the dozens. Taste defeat by the dozens.

On behalf of the Five Envoys, understood. We shall concentrate on eliminating those Heroic Spirits.

...Humph. I do understand your frustration.[sr]I too feel ready to lose control from anger.
[k]

＠Solomon
Why fight? Why lend a hand to Chaldea? Have you Heroic Spirits seen nothing throughout human history?
