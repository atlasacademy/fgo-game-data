...Mash. Did you feel anything strange from that Servant just now?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Nostalgia, perhaps? Or that you know him somehow?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
I didn't really feel anything in particular...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...No, I actually did have a strange sensation.[sr]We're both Servants, but something seemed different...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
I see. Hmm, then Lucius really might be his True Name. Don't know what to make of that, though...
[k]

？1：Is the True Name Lucius strange?

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
It's not really strange, but saying that name itself is something of a joke.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Lucius is the name of a Roman emperor who appears in the “Historia Regum Britanniae.”
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He didn't achieve any particular feats worth mentioning...
[k]

？2：Right... He didn't look like an emperor...

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Master, you know him!?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Da Vinci
Wow, I see you know your stuff, [%1]! That's right, Lucius was an emperor of Rome.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He appears in the “Historia Regum Britanniae,” but he was a very minor emperor...

...Anyway, the issue isn't his True Name.[sr]What's strange is the Noble Phantasm on his right arm.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That was Nuadha's right arm.[sr]The shining arm, Airgetlám.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
Well, he isn't actually Nuadha, so there's no mistake that it's a replica...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But even then, its power was extraordinary.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It was able to defeat a sphinx, a creature of near divinity. What kind of mechanism could be behind it?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
I'm curious... so curious... And as someone who also has an artificial arm, I'm also envious!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I want something like that tooooo! I want to defeat a sphinx all by myself tooooo!

＠Nitocris
Stopping the sandstorm like I did means that demonic beasts outside of our control will invade.

That's why you must guard me, just in case. You have a responsibility to bring me to the grand temple.
