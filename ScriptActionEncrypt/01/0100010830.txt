At the same time, I feel like this is destiny.[sr]That you and I share a special connection.

Don't we? The fate of a executioner killing the same[sr]person twice, I feel like only we share that kind of connection.

Amadeus, you claimed all lives, all humans, are filthy.[sr]Not I. Humans are sacred, precious things.

That's why we executioners respect life.[sr]We are incompatible, you and I.
