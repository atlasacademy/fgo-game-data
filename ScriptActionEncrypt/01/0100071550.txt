But this is going too far. To desire something more productive than humans to get revenge on them... That defeats the whole point.

Kingu has left the front line and is heading towards you at high speed.

At this rate, you'll have to fight both Gorgon and Kingu. And you won't have a chance then.

That you'd be a goddess for the beasts whose land was stolen, we could at least understand! But...why do something like this?

Returning our lands? Restoring our kingdom? What could that matter? There is nothing left for us.

All we love has slipped through our fingers. All we protected is gone from this land.

Even I have burned to ash and vanished.

There is nothing left that I want. There is only vengeance. Destruction.

I will kill everything, trample everything, slay the whole world, and die myself.

That is what it means to be an Avenger. That is what I want.

I will destroy Uruk... I will destroy every single human... For such is the level of hatred you humans had for me.

You're a human, and humans created me... Created this Avenger. If you find reason within my words, then nod.

If you embrace my purpose, then I will keep you as my Master.

＠Gorgon
Not a bad deal, is it? When this era disappears, the world of man is forever gone.

＠Gorgon
Or perhaps it already happened?

＠Gorgon
You have been the last human for so very long...[sr]You've no reason to fight for the people of this time.

Hahaha! Call it the whim of a goddess!

After everything is destroyed, I shall set a single human loose into the barren wastes!
