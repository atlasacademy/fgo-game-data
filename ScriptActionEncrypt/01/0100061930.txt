I'm Tristan, a Knight of the Round Table.[sr]I've come to collect your heads.

＠Tristan
Life is so transient.[sr]A meeting can become a parting.

＠Tristan
But such is this world.[sr]To kill and be killed is the way of war.
[k]

＠Tristan
Your fate is to burn to ashes, together with this miserable village.

I've disposed of the men left in the village. After I finish you off, I'll get the villagers who fled for the cave.

I've already told you.[sr]It's because of you, poison girl.
[k]

＠Tristan
You are the cause of everything. This isn't about us taking revenge because you poisoned the knights at the fort.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]
＠Tristan
You've foolishly decided to join up with them.[sr]THAT is the reason why this happened.
[k]

＠Tristan
My bow chased your footsteps. Yours alone. If you had fled your own way, this would not have occurred.

Exactly. This is entirely your fault.
[k]

＠Tristan
You should've told us everything at that prison, and quietly died alone.
[k]

＠Tristan
Vermin should be like vermin, slaves should be like slaves. You should've known your place.

＠Tristan
The Heroic Spirit of the Round Table who refused the Lion King's summons. The one chosen by the Holy Grail...

[charaFace B 5]
＠Tristan
...Very well. If this be my fate, I have only to confirm its truth with my bow.
