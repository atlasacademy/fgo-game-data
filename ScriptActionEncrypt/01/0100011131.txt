＠Amadeus
Hello, is this seat taken?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Oh, no![sr]Be my guest.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Amadeus
I'm sorry to be a bother while you're relaxing, but those dragons over there are too noisy.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
...[sr]...Amadeus. Marie was very kind to me.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Amadeus
But of course. She was kind to everyone, but her affection for you was unique.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
Why do you suppose that was?[sr]Because I'm a fellow Frenchwoman?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Amadeus
I'm not sure. I don't think it had anything to do with you being French.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Amadeus
Whether one is from England, Spain, or the Far East, that is of no importance to Maria.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Amadeus
The reason she was fond of you, that she held you in[sr]high esteem, was because you were a young woman who took a stand all on her own.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Amadeus
In a sense, Maria is the same. She became a queen at 14[sr]and was forced into battle all alone in Versailles.
[k]

＠Amadeus
...Of course, I'm sure that her battles paled in comparison to yours.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Amadeus
Battlefields with cannonballs and conspiracies are in truth, fundamentally different.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Amadeus
Nevertheless, it was indeed a life or death struggle for[sr]her. That is why she empathized with you.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
Because she was living through a lonely battle of her own?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Amadeus
And one other reason.[sr]This is the important one.
[k]

＠Amadeus
For Maria, standing up for a loved one is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Be it family, another person, a Servant[line 2][sr]or even the nation itself.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Amadeus
True, she was a sheltered girl who knew no hardship, so her way of standing up for someone was rather off-key.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
...Oh, is that so?[sr]In that case, I wanted to stand up for her as a friend.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
Given the situation, nothing could've been done,[sr]but I wish[line 2]I could've been by her side.
[k]

＠Jeanne
...I like to believe so.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Amadeus
A friend, eh? Yes, you thinking of her that way[sr]would be the ultimate reward for her.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Maria and I have one thing in common.[sr]We were not blessed with friends.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Amadeus
But, her wish was fulfilled in this second life. I get the[sr]feeling she was able to move on with a light heart.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
Um... Actually, I think of you as a comrade.[sr][%1] feels the same too.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Amadeus
No, no, that won't do. After all, I don't think that of you.[sr]Maria said it, remember? I'm fundamentally trash.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Amadeus
I only love music. That is how I lived my life, and I am proud of that fact.
[k]

＠Amadeus
That is why I cannot make friends.[sr]Instead, I left behind many pieces of music.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Amadeus
If I had any desire for human happiness, I would vanish in a cloud of self-hatred.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Amadeus
Still, thank you Jeanne d'Arc.[sr]I'm sure that Maria had no regrets.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
I shall avenge her.[sr]...No, vengeance isn't important, is it?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
I will make her wish come true.[sr]I will save this France.

I am treating him right now.[sr]His mind perished with her.

All we can do is to keep his Spiritron Shell intact, and use him as a foot soldier.

There's no longer any need, Master.[sr]They're heading straight for Orleans.
[k]

＠Berserk Saber
Looks like it's a final showdown they want.[sr]Don't you want the same thing?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
...So, they've stopped running around have they?[sr]Which means they think they have a shot at winning.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Berserk Saber
I suppose they do.[sr]They have many Servants as well.
[k]

We might have dragons on our side, but this should still be a glorious fight.

You're enjoying yourself?
[k]

[charaFace H 1]

Of course. As you know, I'm not right in the head.[sr]I'll be just as happy with wiping them out as being wiped out by them.
