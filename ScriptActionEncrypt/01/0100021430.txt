...Well, well.[sr]To think you took out Romulus.

[charaFace F 3]
＠Lev
Nice work for a "mere" Demi-Servant. Have you[sr]become more powerful since I last saw you at Fuyuki?
[k]

＠Lev
However, a Servant is still a Servant. Sorry,[sr]but you'll never surpass the power of the Holy Grail.

Is that the Court Mage?[sr]Then that golden chalice he has is[line 2]

Yes, that's the Holy Grail.[sr]It looks similar in shape to the one we saw before...

Who could've thought a Court Mage would ignore his[sr]king's crisis. I guess betrayal is second nature to you now, Professor Lev?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Actually, perhaps this is the real you? You seem more[sr]energetic than when you were at Chaldea.
[k]

？1：Save the small talk for later!

？2：Hand over the Holy Grail!

I see.[sr]Looks like you've learned to talk back, [&boy:girl].
[k]

＠Lev
I hear you did quite a bit in France.[sr]Thanks to that[line 3] I really got yelled at!
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Lev
I would've been back at the Temple already, but I got sent back out!
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Lev
As a result, I am here to do some clean-up.
[k]

＠Lev
My plan was to give the Grail to a fitting fool,[sr]then enjoy what would unfold. But you ruined that.

＠Dr. Roman
...I see. Find a human, or a Heroic Spirit[sr]who wants to plunge an era into madness.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Then if you give them the Grail, that era would surely drive itself into madness.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's what happened in France, but this time[line 3]

Yes, the Holy Progenitor Romulus, did not wish for[sr]the downfall of mankind. That's why[line 3]

You have no other choice but to interfere yourself.

That's quite ironic, Professor Lev. In this era,[sr]the only betrayer of mankind is you.

Shut it trash.[sr]I never had any hope for humans in the first place.

＠Lev
You either, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Lev
You think you can stop me, Lev Lainur,[sr]just because you defeated a few Servants?
[k]

？1：It's not going to go like before!

[charaFace F 2]
＠Lev
It's true you've changed.[sr]You've grown quite a bit.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Lev
You've grown more stupid that is! Don't you know that if[sr]you try to resist, you're going to suffer that much more?
[k]

？2：What are you after?

[charaFace F 2]
＠Lev
I believe I told you, I already long completed my objective.[sr]This is what you should be asking, [%1].
[k]

＠Lev
"Why did you destroy humanity?" 
[k]

＠Lev
Although, even if you did ask me, I have no reason to answer you.
[k]

？！

[charaFace F 3]
＠Lev
Besides, I think you people misunderstand something.[sr]Recover the Grail, repair the Singularity,[sr]protect mankind[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Lev
Protect humanity? [line 3]Idiots.[sr]There's nothing you can do.
[k]

＠Lev
There's no point in struggling. The end is certain.[sr]You're insignificant, worthless!
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Lev
You will perish in sorrow![sr]Allow me to show you the favor of our King!
