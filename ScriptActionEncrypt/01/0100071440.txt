I believe he's referring to the Lord of Aratta, the rival of Enmerkar, the first king of Uruk.

＠Mash
King Enmerkar came two generations before King Gilgamesh. He was also tricked by Inanna...

Ishtar cajoled him into attacking the land of Aratta for its abundant ore.

？！

＠Gilgamesh
Ah, the Abyss, yes. In Mesopotamia, there are the heavens and the earth, the underworld under the earth, and beneath that, the Abyss.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
The Abyss is a sea of nothingness. The gods Abzu and Tiamat came from that dark sea, and created Mesopotamia.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
You could call it the primordial sea that existed before life itself.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Now that Enki, the god who managed the Abyss, has disappeared, there would be no returning if you fell into it.

Now that you mention it... I heard that Enkidu also had some dealings here in the underworld, didn't they?
[k]

＠Mash
If I remember correctly, King Gilgamesh ordered Enkidu to go to the underworld, then Enkidu told him all about it when they returned.

＠Ishtar
You're pretty knowledgeable, Mash. But the truth is actually much worse than that.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Goldie over there was really into his new invention, a musical instrument, and had a party for three days and three nights.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Ereshkigal was fed up with all the noise so she opened the gate to the underworld, just a little.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The king was pretty drunk, so he accidentally dropped his instrument into the hole.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Ishtar
He was furious; you should have seen the tantrum he threw!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Ishtar
Enkidu couldn't just watch the king rage, so they went down to the underworld alone.
[k]

＠Ishtar
And so Enkidu went and took a look at the underworld, showed their gratitude to Ereshkigal, and returned to the surface.

Yes. Enkidu hated Ishtar, but was respectful to Ereshkigal.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
...Ereshkigal was the one who took in Enkidu's remains. We couldn't leave the remains of a weapon of the gods on the surface.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Gilgamesh
The thought was that they could rest in peace if they were entombed in the underworld. But...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Gilgamesh
I knew there was time before you lot appeared, so I visited Enkidu's grave. However, their remains had disappeared.

It's just as you say Ishtar. That Enkidu isn't Enkidu.

Even though Enkidu was buried, there were things that still resided in the body. That is now what we see.
