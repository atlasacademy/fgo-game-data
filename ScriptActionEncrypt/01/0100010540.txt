＠F：???
Yes, that's right. I'm so happy. This is what it means[sr]to announce oneself as a hero of justice!

[charaFace F 4]
＠F：???
I know who you are.[sr]I also know how powerful and terrifying you are.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠F：???
To be honest, I have to confess that I've never trembled in fear more before anyone else.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠F：???
Yet still[line 3]If you intend to invade this nation, then I shall face you even if I have to tear apart my dress.

[charaFace H 5]
＠Berserk Saber
I can tell who she is, even with this murderous rage burning in my heart. Her beauty is unmistakable.
[k]

＠Berserk Saber
The girl they called the Flower of Versailles.[sr]She is[line 3]Marie Antoinette.

＠Marie Antoinette
That's right![sr]Thank you for saying my name!
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
And as long as that name exists, I will play my role, no matter how foolish it may be.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
You! Dragon Witch who's torching my country.[sr]It might be pointless, but I will ask you anyway.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
Are you evil enough to perform your wicked deeds in my very presence?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Will you declare yourself a greater fool than I, the queen who failed to stop the revolution?

That's why I can't bear to look at you like this.[sr]Oh, Jeanne d'Arc, beloved saint!
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
All I know is that you're taking your rage out on the innocent.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
And I've not the slightest idea why. Everything's[sr]disappearing into a haze, like a girl going for a Sunday walk.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
I've no words for you.[sr]What I do know is this.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]

Along with the Jeanne d'Arc over there.[sr]I am going to make your heart and body mine!

I just meant that as a Queen, I'm going to bring you to your knees.
