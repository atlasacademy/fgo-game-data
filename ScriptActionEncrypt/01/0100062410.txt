Looks like the little kitty's happy to be outside again.[sr]Of course, I'm very happy, too... I'm at a loss for words!

It was a long corridor, after all. Looks like the sandstorm died down, as well.
[k]

＠Mash
Most likely because it was directly above the Atlas Institute. This region does not belong to the Sun King, after all.

A failure of one of the Knights of the Round Table... must be dealt with by a knight...
[k]


？1：But first, I want to confirm something.
？2：I want to ask about the sacred lance.

？！


[charaFace B 3]

Th-That is an excellent point... It seems I let the blood rush to my head, as well.

The Knights of the Round Table all believe in the king, but that does not mean they know what the lance represents...

Yes. If they are following the Lion King without understanding the role of the lance, it makes sense that they would be convinced.

＠Bedivere
The Holy City is no ideal city. That is the Tower at the Ends of the World. It gathers the most ideal humans, and places them in a cage...
[k]

＠Bedivere
And when that is realized, this entire area will disappear. What the Lion King is doing goes beyond what humans must do.

When the city has enough human souls, the doors to the Tower at the Ends of the World will open.

This is what the Lion King announced as soon as he summoned us.
[k]

＠Lancelot
And we decided to obey. Based on his ideals, we slaughtered the Crusaders...
[k]

[charaFace H 5]

...and decided to become enemies to all in this era. We have done this even knowing that what the king is doing is inhuman!
