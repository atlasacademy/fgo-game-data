...The "Ark" contains the Ten Commandments[sr]that Moses, leader of ancient Israel, received from God.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
From a historical standpoint,[sr]it's a relic equivalent to that of the true Holy Grail.

That's what Jason and the Argonauts are searching for.[sr]I'm certain that that's what he said.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Even with Mistah Blackbeard gone, the Singularity still stands.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Which means we should assume that Jason,[sr]captain of the Argonauts, is the Singularity.

...So should we steal the Ark first?

＠Dr. Roman
What I found incomprehensible was[sr]the actual concept of using the Ark.
[k]

？1：The concept itself was incomprehensible?

？2：There's no way to use the Ark?

？！

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
They say the Ten Commandments are sealed inside.[sr]Whoever opens it will be punished...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Basically it's one of those "don't open it" fables.[sr]Just like Pandora's Box in Greece.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Which is why I can't even begin to imagine why[sr]they'd want to find it and use it. It's just stupid.

Captain, have you been listening?[sr]"The Ark" activates when it's broken or opened.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And the effect is... well, it is divine punishment.[sr]At worst, the surrounding area will be reduced to nothingness.

Um... I'm just not sure how to fight the Argonauts.[sr]More specifically, how do we fight Heracles?

Heracles... Even as a Berserker,[sr]his powers as a great hero weren't diminished.

＠Euryale
It was only because Asterios held him down[sr]that we were able to flee to safety.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Euryale
...Seems like he died.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Yes, most likely.
[k]

＠Euryale
[line 2]How foolish.[sr]We just called his name. That's all it took for him[line 2]
[k]

＠Euryale
With just that, he felt he could die for us.[sr]Just because we called him "Asterios," not "Minotaur."
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Euryale
That's the reason he risked his life to protect us...[sr]It was just that pure and simple.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
？1：He had no regrets.

？2：Without him we all would have died.

？！

[charaFace E 4]
＠Euryale
...Perhaps. But it might have been better[sr]if we were cleanly wiped out then and there.
[k]

＠Euryale
Asterios died, and Heracles still lives.[sr]With just that, it makes it all seem so hopeless.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

That Heracles...[sr]He has to die like ten more times?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
It's eleven times. But perhaps he died once[sr]when he got pierced by the spear at the end.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
In that case, it's still ten... Not much difference.
