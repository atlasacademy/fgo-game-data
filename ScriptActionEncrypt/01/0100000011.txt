Hmm, [%1].[sr]So you're the last of the 48 candidates.
[k]

＠Lev
Welcome to Chaldea.[sr]I'm glad you're here.
[k]

＠Lev
I heard you were selected out of many public applicants, how long was your training?[sr]A year? 6 months? 3 months?
[k]

？1：...I'll leave that to your imagination.

＠Lev
I see that you already know how competitive it is in here.[sr]You're going to hide your info from your rivals?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
[charaFadein A 0]
＠Mash
Dr. Lev, [%1]'s training was less than a few hours. I think it's from embarrassment.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lev
Oh? Well, now... I see. We had an emergency opening for applicants to fill out numbers.
[k]

？2：No, I didn't go through any training.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lev
Oh? So you're a complete amateur?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lev
Right... Come to think of it, we did call for applicants just to fill numbers.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lev
So you're one of them?[sr]Do forgive me, I was inconsiderate.
[k]

＠Lev
But please don't be discouraged because you're a public applicant. We need all of you for this mission.
[k]

＠Lev
38 elite mages, plus 10 talented public applicants...[sr]Somehow, we were able to gather all possible candidates.
[k]

＠Lev
That's something to rejoice over. This year, 2017, all possible candidates capable of Spiritron Dives were brought to Chaldea.
[k]

＠Lev
If there's something you don't understand,[sr]feel free to ask Mash or myself anytime... Hmm?
[k]

＠Lev
Come to think of it, what were you talking about with [&him:her], Mash? That's not like you. Did you know each other before?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
No, I'd never met Senpai before.[sr]I saw Senpai sleeping here, so I just...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lev
Sleeping?[sr][%1] was asleep, here?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Lev
Ahh, you went through the simulation when you entered, right? Spiritron Dives can get to you if you're not used to them.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lev
After the simulation, the gate must've opened and you walked over here before you returned to consciousness.
[k]

＠Lev
It's a type of sleep-walking. When you fell, [%1], that was when Mash spoke to you.
[k]

＠Lev
You seem to be fine, but I'd like to take you to the infirmary just in case...
[k]

＠Lev
Sorry, hang in there a little longer. The Director's orientation is about to start. You should hurry over.
[k]

？1：Director?

＠Lev
The Director's the director. The person in charge of Chaldea, and the commander of our special missions.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lev
Since you're a rookie from the public, you may have only seen the pamphlet?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
It would appear so.[sr]Since the Director's profile hasn't been made public.
[k]

＠Mash
Senpai has no connection to the Director.[sr]Only mages from families that have been around for over a century show respect to the Animusphere name.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lev
Right. Well, whether you know the Director or not, it doesn't affect your work as a Master, so it's not a problem.
[k]

＠Lev
But it's good to not get on her bad side. If you wish to work in a peaceful environment, better hurry.
[k]

＠Lev
There's an orientation by the Director at the Central Command Room in 5 minutes. She's putting on a presentation for the newbies.
[k]

？2：Orientation?

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes, to greet the Master candidates assigned here today like you, [%1].
[k]

＠Lev
In other words, it's for the big boss to welcome the careless newbies.
[k]

＠Lev
Since the Director is not the type to forgive and forget, if you show up late, you'll be on her radar for the entire year.
[k]

＠Lev
The orientation begins in five minutes in the Central Command Room. Go straight down this hall. Hurry.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Dr. Lev, do you think I'll be allowed to sit in on the orientation, too?
[k]

＠Lev
Hmm? Well, if you stand way back in a corner,[sr]I think she'll look the other way... But why?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
I just thought I should take Senpai to the Command Room. It's possible that Senpai might fall asleep on the way again.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Lev
...If I leave you alone like this the Director might yell at me... I should tag along as well, eh?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lev
Well, if that's what you want to do, Mash, go ahead.[sr]You okay with that [%1]?
[k]

＠Lev
If you have no other questions, let's head to the Command Room. Is there anything else you want to know?
[k]

？1：I have no questions.

＠Lev
All right, let's get going.[sr]Stand up straight, but remember to relax, okay?
[k]

？2：Why is she calling me Senpai?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
...
[k]

＠Lev
Oh, don't worry about it.[sr]To her, every human your age is her senpai.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lev
But it's unusual to hear her actually call someone that.[sr]This might be the first time.
[k]

＠Lev
Actually, I'm intrigued.[sr]Say, Mash, why do you call [&him:her] Senpai?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
The reason? [%1] is the most human-like person I've ever met.
[k]

＠Lev
Hmm. Which means?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
I don't feel threatened.[sr]So there's no reason for me to be hostile.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Lev
I see, that is important![sr]People at Chaldea are all a piece of work!
[k]

＠Lev
I agree with you, Mash.[sr]I think you two will get along just fine!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...If you like Senpai Dr. Lev, the Director will probably hate Senpai.
[k]

＠Mash
...Well, why don't we hide in the restroom to boycott the orientation, then?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lev
That will only make the Director more upset.[sr]We're going to have to leave it to fate.
[k]

＠Lev
Shall we jump into the lions' den, [%1]? Hey, once you get used to her, she can be a pretty sweet person.

Hey Lev, I feel bad for them.[sr]Why don't I give them some anesthesia?

[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Oh, that guy's named Lev Lainur.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He's the mage who created the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba[line 3] A telescope used to observe that pseudo-planet, Chaldeas.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Sheba not only observes Chaldeas, but also serves as a surveillance system for most of this facility.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Also, it was the previous director who built the summoning/unsummoning system, which is the foundation of the Rayshift tech.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
To actualize that theory, the Pseudo-Spiritron Calculation Engine, (basically a super computer) was provided by the Atlas Academy.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
All these different talents have been gathered to carry out this mission.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's pointless for an ordinary doctor like me to be there, but if I'm summoned, I must go.
