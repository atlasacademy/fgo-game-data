Right... Da Vinci is an undisputed genius...

I'm sure she's alive. They say the ornithopter was originally an airplane, after all...

Surely she flew up into the air right before the explosion...

...What could that be? Don't tell me there's some barrier around the village?

＠Refugee Man
No. Nothing like that. I'm talking about food and water.

＠Refugee Man
We're talking about 50 people here... We never had much, but that Da Vinci lady held things together...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...That's right. Tending the wounded, gathering food, even using alchemy to create water. Da Vinci did it all...

Being too talented can almost be harmful. People find themselves relying on her before they know it...

I'm sorry, but providing food is no longer an option.

The refugees must travel to the village without food or water over the next day.

I have a knack for telling which animals are safe for humans to eat. It is amazing.
