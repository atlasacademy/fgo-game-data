They're so strong! If we let our guard down at all, Mordred will use that Noble Phantasm!

＠Mash
Bedivere is keeping Mordred contained for now, but we can't go on like this forever!

That's an impressive artificial arm! Was that why you spoke so boldly earlier!?

Where'd you get a thing like that, coward!? I don't remember us having anything like that!

[line 3]You callin' me a blockhead?[sr]Oh, you so did! You always called me that.
[k]

＠Mordred
Don't get cocky, Bedivere. You're just a feeble knight who sat down in the extra seat.
[k]

＠Mordred
You'd never have become the king's attendant if Agravain hadn't kicked it so early.
[k]

＠Mordred
You're nothing compared to me! King Arthur just happened to take a liking to you!

＠Bedivere
...Yes, you're right. I'm nowhere near the other knights.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I have neither the fairies' blessings, nor the sun's... I have no inherent gifts...
[k]

＠Bedivere
I was nothing but an ordinary knight.[sr]Yet the king relied on me until his last breath.
[k]

＠Bedivere
To repay that kindness, this arm was granted to me. A gift from the archmage Merlin. Nuadha's arm.

Fine, I'll kill you right here! There'll be nothing left of you when I'm done!
[k]

＠Mordred
I won't even tell the king you were here! You'll never come close to seeing such a thing ever again!

[line 3]Burn my soul and unleash thyself, O silver light.

＠Bedivere
...Both my loyalty and your loyalty are one and the same.
[k]

＠Bedivere
In the past they were true, but now their roots are distorted.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Bedivere
Mordred... You are both my sworn enemy and brother-in-arms. I can understand that pain now.
[k]

＠Bedivere
That is precisely why I shall slay you with all my strength. Switch On - Airgetlám!
