＠Dr. Roman
I can feel the tension across the screen...[sr]The Director is grumpy as usual.
[k]

？1：She's not just grumpy, she's a total crank.

？2：Why is she always so mad?

？！

＠Mash
Well, I can feel some sympathy for the Director's ill temper.
[k]

＠Mash
Excuse me, but [%1] Senpai, there's too much about Chaldea you don't know.
[k]

？1：Y-You really think so?

？2：Well, I admit I came here clueless...

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
I really don't know what to do with you.[sr]It's like you're a lost little kitty.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
[line 3]Well, not that I'm any different.
[k]

＠Mash
It's been about two years since I started here, and I still[sr]don't get it. I kind of sneaked in. Almost like an alligator.
[k]

？1：I-Is that right?

？2：True, alligators have no clue.

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes, I've learned as much as I can from the database.[sr]But I'll share it with you.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Chaldea Security Organization. Or more accurately,[sr]the Security Organization for the Preservation of Humanity, Fenis Chaldea.
[k]

＠Mash
A research observatory with the purpose of continuing and strengthening human history, with researchers, scholars, and mages from all around the world.
[k]

＠Mash
They watch a world that magecraft couldn't observe, and science couldn't measure.
[k]

＠Mash
We're a special organization with national support, created to prevent humanity from reaching a "bad end."
[k]

？1：You sure know a lot, Mash.

？2：Yeah, I figured.

？！

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Anyway, that's pretty much it.

It's true that Chaldea receives financial support from across the globe, but the majority of that comes from the Mage's Association in London[line 3]
[k]

＠Mash
From the the Animusphere family.[sr]Director Olga Marie's family.
[k]

＠Mash
Chaldea is a research organization, but due to its importance, it operates on a military level.
[k]

＠Mash
There are extremely strict rules and punishments for everything, so the Director's attitude is actually reserved.
[k]

＠Mash
The Director isn't a villain, but she is evil.[sr]She'll get rid of any staff member she doesn't like.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Well, I'm not sure if it's okay to call someone who's got a bad attitude, evil.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...Sorry, I wanted to give you some encouragement, but I'm not used to cheery words.
[k]

＠Fou
Kyu. Kyu, kyu!
