＠Mash
Not just Heracles. Medea and Hektor also possess[sr]terrifying power.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
If all three attack at once,[sr]it'll be impossible for us to hold out.
[k]

＠Mash
If we could at least lure Heracles away from the[sr]others[line 2]
[k]

？1：...

？！

[charaSet B 98003003 1 "Dr. Roman"]
＠Dr. Roman
...How about we flee with the "Ark" in tow,[sr]and wait for an opportunity...
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
Doctor, just go choke on an[sr]expired sesame bun or something.

How about we hole up?[sr]Anywhere like that near here?
[k]

＠Atalante
Nope. Some cramped pagan catacombs[sr]are all this island has.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Atalante
Even if there were some kind of stronghold here,[sr]it wouldn't be enough to hold off Heracles.
[k]

＠Orion
Hmm, I suppose you're right.

Master?

...Yes?

Oh good, nice, great idea![sr]You're just as reliable a [&man:woman] as I thought!
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠David
That's a reasonable strategy. But, besides the Servants,[sr][%1] would also be at risk.
[k]

＠David
Well, I guess that's life. The odds of winning[sr]usually go up with your life on the line.

Will Heracles head straight[sr]for Euryale?

...Out of countless Heroic Spirits, Heracles is[sr]likely in the top tier.
[k]

＠Orion
Even though he's Berserker, I doubt[sr]he's completely devoid of intelligence.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Orion
When he was fighting Asterios,[sr]he was dead set on going after Euryale.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Orion
...That's the reason Asterios somehow managed[sr]to keep up.

Berserkers are easy to lure.[sr]The one I can't get a read on is Jason.

[charaFace D 5]

He impaled the enemy along with his own ally.[sr]Who knows what other cowardly tricks he'll pull off?

＠Atalante
No, don't worry about Jason.[sr]Trust me. I'm sure he will act this way.
[k]

＠Atalante
...It's true he's a coward, but, more than that,[sr]he places absolute trust in Heracles.

[charaFace E 1]

I like [%1]'s plan. Count me in.

Count me in, too. Since everyone's betting equally,[sr]it's fine as long as one of us survives and wins it all.

Are you expecting something from me, a plush toy?

＠Orion
It's Mash who has it toughest here.[sr]She's risking her life on the front line.
[k]

＠Orion
Shouldn't Mash decide whether we go through[sr]with this plan or not?

＠Mash
...I'm fine. I'll make sure that[sr]the plan Master devised succeeds.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Of course, that's contingent on the Doctor's cooperation.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Doctor?[sr]You've been silent for a while now. Are you listening?
[k]

[charaSet B 98003003 1 "Dr. Roman"]
＠Dr. Roman
Of course I'm listening.[sr]It's risky, but we don't have any time left. Count me in.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We don't know when or if King David will fall into[sr]enemy hands. I'll provide all the backup I can.
[k]

？1：Let's do this.

？2：Let's win.

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes, Master!
