＠Gawain
So this is the end... I guess this is divine intervention...
[k]

＠Gawain
In the end I won't make it to the king's fight... I guess that is my fate for being an unfaithful knight...

...What are you saying? There is no knight more loyal than you, Sir Gawain.
[k]

＠Bedivere
You're the same as me. You admire what it means to be a king rather than the concept of honor.
[k]

＠Bedivere
You cannot call yourself unfaithful...

...Not when the Holy City was prosperous... but when everything is about to end...

...The King may have regained his heart... if you were the one...

I...resent you from the bottom of my heart.

However, I cannot ignore your evil plans. You will pay for the numerous atrocities you've caused in the name of the king.

...My mother was mad.
[k]

＠Agravain
“One day, you will rule over Britain.” That was the grudge I had to hear when I was growing up.
[k]

＠Agravain
Through the plan of my mother, Morgan, I got to sit among you all. I did not want to be a Knight of the Round Table, but I suppose that was the fastest way.
[k]

＠Agravain
I was but a tool to steal the throne away from King Arthur and give it to my mother.
[k]

＠Agravain
I agreed to it. I understood that Britain needed a strong king.
[k]

＠Agravain
I just wanted Britain to continue on. I used King Arthur to that end.
[k]

＠Agravain
...I used our king.
[k]

I wanted a king that would labor. A king that would, even for a little bit, extend Britain's life.
[k]

＠Agravain
I just needed someone for my plan. I did not really care who became king.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Agravain
King Arthur was the best. That is all. King Arthur was easier to use than Morgan.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Agravain
I hate women.
[k]

＠Agravain
Morgan was a vixen, ugly to her core. And Guinevere, who extolled virtue, fell in love with you.
[k]

＠Agravain
I have and will continue to hate women.
[k]

＠Agravain
I will continue to despise humans.
[k]

＠Agravain
And I will continue to resent the emotion of love.
[k]

＠Agravain
That is me...
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Agravain
Do you understand the relief I felt when I found out the first person that made me fear being resented...was a man?
[k]

＠Agravain
...That's what you and Guinevere have done. You cannot even fathom the emptiness I felt in my heart when I found out of my king's pain.
