...Yes. What should we do now? We have no way to have an audience with the Lion King.
[k]

＠Mash
If we head to the Holy City, we'll have to fight the Knights of the Round Table. We currently lack the strength to do so.
[k]

＠Mash
Besides... We cannot simply leave this place. The villagers' living conditions are too poor.
[k]

＠Mash
They don't even have enough food for tomorrow.
[k]

＠Mash
If we leave, Arash will probably be the only one who can hunt...

A fight with the Knights of the Round may be inevitable if we want to face the Lion King and get some answers.

Pardon me if this seems rather rude, but that name... Is that your True Name as a Heroic Spirit?

That's...

I am fully aware that normally, this is not something I should be asking a Servant.

However, I must know. Pardon my manners.

...

...Thank you. But I'm all right, Master.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Sir Bedivere. I'm... not a proper Servant.
[k]

＠Mash
I'm a Demi-Servant. Specifically, I'm the result of a fusion between a human and a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Mash
Mash Kyrielight is merely my name as a human being.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
As for my True Name...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The Heroic Spirit who fused with me perished without telling me. Therefore, I don't know what kind of Heroic Spirit I am.
[k]

＠Mash
I don't even know the True Name of my Noble Phantasm. As such, my Noble Phantasm output... is considerably lower.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Bedivere
...I see. Thank you very much for sharing your story.

＠Bedivere
I apologize again for my manners. All the doubts that I had have now vanished.

Right. It would make sense for a Servant to be curious about the existence of a Demi-Servant.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If anything, all the Heroic Spirits we've met so far are perhaps the exceptions. They all accepted you without question.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Mash is a Servant, but not a Heroic Spirit.

Of course. It's not just me. I'm certain all Knights of the Round Table who have encountered you felt the same way.
[k]

＠Bedivere
The knight who gave you that Noble Phantasm is that special.
[k]

＠Bedivere
He was the strongest, wisest, and most courageous of them all[line 3]
[k]

＠Bedivere
The only one who chose to take pride in a spiritual and mindful path rather than one of strength and martial prowess.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I pray that you yourself will be able to find his True Name.
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 12]

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠Bedivere
Yes. The answer is basically right in front of you. But it is your destiny to discover it for yourself.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Bedivere
...However, as long as the Heroic Spirit inside you is a Knight of the Round Table, there are other issues.
[k]

Namely, will you be able to fight your former comrades?

...Well, I...
[k]

？1：So that's why when we fought Gawain...
？2：Mash looked like she was in pain.

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Yes. When I saw the Holy City's walls, and when I fought Sir Gawain, my body was screaming.

“This is wrong... This can't be the work of King Arthur.” That's what it was telling me...

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠Bedivere
...Yes, that is true.
[k]

＠Bedivere
What the king has done in these lands is definitely not what the King Arthur we know would have done.
[k]

＠Bedivere
...Allow me to be frank. No matter what I must sacrifice, I WILL defeat this Lion King.
[k]

＠Bedivere
That is why I have come this far. That is why I have lived till now.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Bedivere
But what about you? And your friends?
[k]

＠Bedivere
If your goal is to correct this era, then there may be no need to confront the Lion King.
[k]

[charaFace D 11]
＠Bedivere
...I will stay in this village and ask Hassan-i Sabbah to lend me his strength.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Both Lord Hassan and I are rebels in the eyes of the Holy City. They will mercilessly try to purge our lives.
[k]

[charaFace D 8]
＠Bedivere
But you are still neutral. If you surrender now, it may not be too late.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Even then[line 3]will you still fight? Against the Knights of the Round Table? Against the powerful Lion King?
[k]

？1：...Of course.
？2：The Lion King is wrong.

We will fight the Lion King. Of course we value our lives, but even more so[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I cannot overlook what the Lion King did in the Holy City. This goes beyond my responsibility as a knight.
[k]

It's something that must be done to make amends to all who live here. To all those who lost their lives at that gate.
