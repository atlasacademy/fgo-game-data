＠Sanson
That's, impossible![sr]How could I be defeated?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Sanson
I've killed so many since that day, and become so much stronger... So why?

＠Marie Antoinette
How sad, Charles-Henri Sanson.[sr]I should've told you when we reunited.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Our relationship ended that day.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
Because your blade was truly[line 3]rusty.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
You've killed so many people that it's lost its way.[sr]You've increased your proficiency as a killer.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
Executioners and killers are not the same, Sanson.[sr]The more skilled you become at killing others[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
The rustier your blade as an executioner, savior of criminals, becomes.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
By the time you followed the Dragon Witch, you were no longer the Sanson I knew.

No... Lies! It cannot be! I kept my faith that you would come! That's why I kept honing my skills!
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Sanson
To see you, and behead you with more skill[line 3][sr]Give you a much better ecstatic moment!
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Sanson
I thought that by doing so, you would surely forgive me!

...Geez. You really are a pitiful, adorable person.[sr]I don't hold a grudge against you.

From the beginning, you never had the need to be forgiven by me.

Yes. Perhaps the two vampires you[sr]loathe may be the last ones standing.

Just by gaining one Servant?[sr]How ridiculous.

Speaking of ridiculous, it's amazing that you are still here.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Jeanne Alter
Are you intoxicated with the idea of saving these citizens?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Jeanne Alter
You, the person killed by her citizens.[sr]A woman put to the guillotine, beheaded in ridicule!

＠Marie Antoinette
So disappointing.[sr]Witches don't understand such simple logic?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
It's true that I was executed.[sr]There was ridicule, and there was disdain.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
However[line 2][sr]that gives me no reason to murder them in return.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Marie Antoinette
I became a queen because the people asked me to.[sr]A queen cannot be without her people.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Thus, it was inevitable. If they don't want you,[sr]then you exit even if you don't want to.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
That is the destiny of those serving their country.[sr]I believe my execution led to my people's next smile.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
No matter when, viva la France![sr]Stars glimmer, and that will do. That's all we need.

Now I am certain.[sr]Say[line 2]"Dragon Witch."

If I can help the Saint who saved France...[sr]No, if I can help a friend.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
Then I will gladly shed the last of my radiance and fall.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Like a star, like a flower.[sr]Like a fleeting dream.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Marie Antoinette
That is what a Servant is,[sr]and how Marie Antoinette lives[line 2]!
