＠Mash
All hostile units eliminated... Complete silence confirmed.[sr]Good work, Senpai.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Good work.[sr]I received a transmission from Jekyll, so I'll connect you.
[k]

＠Jekyll
Can you hear me?[sr]I have supplemental information to pass on.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Oh[line 3]I see. They took the radio transmission from[sr]Jekyll and patched it through via Dr. Roman's channel.
[k]

＠Jekyll
Right. Chaldea's technology is marvelous. But let me cut[sr]to the chase. It's about the Magical Tome running amok in Soho.
[k]

＠Jekyll
Unlike killer homunculi or automatas, the Magical Tome[sr]can get past closed doors and into buildings. That we know.
[k]

＠Jekyll
We have specifics on the damage now.[sr]They say it puts people into an unending slumber.

＠Mordred
Through magecraft?[sr]Or a drug?
[k]

＠Jekyll
We don't know yet.[sr]If it's just a drug, it shouldn't pose any issue for you...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes, I don't think that would affect us.[sr]Senpai has Poison Resistance Skill (Temporary), too.
[k]

＠Mordred
I see, that's good.[sr]But well, nothing beats good, old-fashioned vigilance.
[k]

＠Mordred
If it is magecraft, in my case, my Magic Resistance[sr]Skill nullifies most effects on me[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
But I can't block a direct hit of, say, a drug made by a[sr]Servant's skill or Noble Phantasm at high magecraft levels.
[k]

？1：Let's be really careful.

？2：It's okay if it doesn't hit us.

？！

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
Well, yeah.[sr]Just act carefully.
[k]

＠Jekyll
Once you've arrived in the Soho area,[sr]stop by the antique bookshop I specified first.
[k]

＠Jekyll
There should be an informant there. That is,[sr]if they haven't been attacked by Magical Tomes yet.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Understood.
[k]

＠Mordred
Then let's get going.[sr]Soho's not far off now.
