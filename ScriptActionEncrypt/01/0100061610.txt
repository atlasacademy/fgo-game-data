When I heard that you ran into Sir Agravain, I was extremely worried...

But you chased off that Agravain of Iron.[sr]What marvelous work. I wish I was there to see it.

[charaFace B 4]

I know I shouldn't be depressed. I know I should look forward to the chance to make it up to you. But...

[charaFace B 1]
＠Bedivere
No, this is bad, I get pessimistic way too easily.[sr]I should be more optimistic like you.

I'm fine. It's not that I can't hold my alcohol,[sr]it's just[line 3]

[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
What does that mean?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Cursed Arm
Hahaha. This is going to be an embarrassing story. You see, out of all of the Old Men of the Mountain, I was the most ordinary.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
I was pretty good at everything, but I didn't have any exceptional talent.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
We Old Men of the Mountain are the greatest assassins of our generation. We each need to have one special skill that nobody else can replicate.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
Hundred Personas can take on a hundred personalities. Serenity's entire body is poisonous, and can also neutralize any poison.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
I never had anything like that. Nevertheless, I still desired to become an Old Man of the Mountain.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
...I guess I was desperate because I was young, or actually, because I was alive.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
I wanted the title of Old Man of the Mountain, no matter the cost. I wanted to earn my place in history as a great, remarkable man.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
And in order to achieve that, I chose to sacrifice my own body.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
...My right arm is not a man's arm.[sr]This is the arm of the demon Shaytan.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
Though I myself lacked talent, I could at least take something that did and make it my own... That was my logic.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
This body, Cursed Arm, is the result.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
My face, my people, my love... I left them all behind and became an Old Man of the Mountain.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
...All without understanding that I would become a nonperson, indistinguishable from the others in history and memory.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Cursed Arm
Well, I'm sorry you had to hear this boring story.[sr]But it looks like we are the only ones who are not drunk.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
[%1], I have one favor to ask of you.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
The smell of this feast has attracted uninvited guests. They now gather outside the village.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
While we're both destined to be sober, would you keep my company a little longer?
[k]

？1：Of course.
？2：I can't rely on you alone, Cursed Arm.

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Cursed Arm
Haha, well then, let's duck out quietly. Tonight is a pleasant dream. The people here need not wake from it.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

Indeed... I'll stay with you, Hassan!
