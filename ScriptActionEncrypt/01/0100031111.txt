＠Drake
All right.[sr]We'll get going soon!

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Huh? But we have no strategy yet...
[k]

＠Drake
Oh please, we can just play it by ear![sr]They say you can't deal with trouble till you run into it.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
Besides, if we waste more time here, they are just gonna[sr]come after Euryale again after they grab that "Ark."
[k]

＠Drake
Anyway, lay forward!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
If what Jason said was correct,[sr]neither of us has any leads.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Drake
Though, we have a better chance because I'm here[sr]instead of their incompetent captain!

...Well, it's true that Jason's worthless.[sr]At least, you're probably a better captain.

＠Orion
He's not a bad guy.
[k]

＠Orion
He's just utterly worthless with a horrible personality,[sr]and now he's getting cocky because he's gained some power.

Senpai, I don't understand which part of him[sr]is "not a bad guy."

Just because you say someone's not a bad guy,[sr]that doesn't excuse everything they've done.

＠Orion
Right.[sr]Okay, I take it back. He's not a good guy.
[k]

＠Orion
He's a scumbag with a terrible personality, but has power.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
There's nothing good about him whatsoever...

See, that's what I meant.[sr]In that case, I win.

＠Drake
Treasure always ends up in the pocket of the decisive[sr]one. That's how this world works!

＠Drake
If Heracles is unstoppable, then bring it on.[sr]Only humans can challenge the impossible.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Drake
We're greedy and shameless.[sr]We live by dreaming of achieving the impossible!
[k]

＠Drake
Isn't that right, [%1]?
[k]

＠Drake
Since you've come all the way to this era,[sr]that makes you just as big a fool as me, right?
[k]

？1：Not as much as you, Captain.

？2：If that's what you think of me, it's promising.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Damn right you are![sr]I'm a merchant. I only go after the best goods!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
...That's right. Both in France and in Rome,[sr]that's how it was for us.
[k]

＠Mash
Let's go, Senpai. With you as my Master,[sr]I feel I can take on any opponent!
[k]

？1：Anchors aweigh!

？2：Set sail!

？！

[charaFace D 2]
＠Drake
Full speed ahead then![sr]Get to it, men! Sound the bell!
[k]

＠Drake
The "Ark" will be ours![sr]Let's go!
