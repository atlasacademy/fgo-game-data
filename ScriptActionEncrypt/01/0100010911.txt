To be honest, I'm nervous about leaving your side.[sr]Not that there's a time when I'm not nervous about you.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Amadeus
...But lots are derived from fate.[sr]If I defy fate, I might invite misfortune.

[charaFace F 1]

Well, you can use your Noble Phantasm to escape, and Jeanne is a defense specialist.

Master... Thank you!

[charaFace F 0]

Actually, what I meant was it's because we have Siegfried who's wounded.

Amadeus, make sure you get along with them.[sr]You tend to be misunderstood by friends.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Amadeus
I don't want to hear it from you.[sr]Anyway, Maria...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Yeah?
[k]

＠Amadeus
Well, never mind. Just be careful along the way.[sr]Don't try to find a pastry shop even if you get hungry.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
Oh! My heart beat thinking that you might propose to me again!

When Mr. Amadeus, standing right there, was 6 years[sr]old, he proposed to Marie who was 7 years old.

Yes, I reached out to him as he fell, then I saw him staring at me with his starry eyes[line 2]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Marie Antoinette
"Thank you, nice lady. My name is Amadeus."
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
"If a beautiful lady like you has no fiance yet, could I be the first one?"
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
He said that to me![sr]I'd never been flattered like that since I was born!
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Amadeus
Who knew the story would get passed down...[sr]this is a nightmare...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Hehehe. Of course it would.[sr]I was so happy that I told everybody about it.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Amadeus
So it was you! You did it![sr]You turned me down! You're such a femme fatale!
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Marie Antoinette
I had no choice. After all, I couldn't decide who would be my fiance.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
Besides[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Amadeus
Besides?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
You know how my life was after that, don't you? I was happy with my decision. It was best to turn you down.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
It turned out that you were loved by many people as a[sr]musician. That's why I ended my life as a silly queen.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
It can't be helped you see, I have no choice because I'm always in love.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
Maybe I was in love with a country named France.[sr]I only loved the country itself, not the people...
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
Because I was such an arrogant woman, I ended up getting killed by the nation.

Am I?

[charaFace F 4]
＠Amadeus
Yes, you are. You've got it all wrong.[sr]You say you were in love with France?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Amadeus
You're wrong. It's not that you were in love with[sr]the country. France was in love with you.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
[line 6][sr]...Yes. Thank you, Mozart.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

Wait. Isn't that strange? Doesn't that mean that I was killed by the people who loved me?

That's right. That's how people are.
