Oh. This is a diagram of Tiamat's true form? This is made really well. How'd you do it?
[k]


＠Dr. Roman
Hehe, it's a collaboration between me and Uruk's priests! Based on their information, I polished it up!
[k]


＠Gilgamesh
Yes. Good work on that front. But now, take a look at her legs.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
From last night til dawn, we received several reports from the surviving academic facilities near the coast.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
“Tiamat is walking on the water's surface.” “It doesn't look like she can control her own weight.”
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
“We hypothesize that those legs may be too thin to support that giant body. We should assume Tiamat can only walk on water.”

That was the final report. Both myself and Chaldea believe this theory is dead-on.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
If it wasn't, there's little reason to encroach on the land like that.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Its purpose is to engulf the land, but at the same time it creates a pathway for Tiamat[line 3]

Even if we can't kill Tiamat on land, if we get rid of the ocean around her, we can stop her movement.

Therefore, our combat objective shifts from Tiamat to that black mud. We will remove it entirely!

Chaldea has named that black mud, “Encroaching Ocean: Chaos Tide.” They're feverishly analyzing a way to revert it to normal seawater.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If they make it in time, we can delay Tiamat's arrival at Uruk...

I will be the one to remove that black mud... No, the Chaos Tide.

I can't do an entire ocean's worth, but my Noble Phantasm is enough to clear a perimeter around Tiamat once she gets ashore.

I will use my Sun's Pilgrimage: Piedra del Sol to vaporize the mud right out from under her, yes!

It's dangerous to position yourself right in front of Tiamat. We don't know what she'll do to enemies once she sees them.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A large number of Laḫmu are circling around Tiamat as well. Battling them will be inevitable.

＠Dr. Roman
We're verifying a route that won't be in Tiamat's line of sight with relatively few Laḫmu.

I declare to all remaining citizens of Uruk.

＠Gilgamesh
I commend you for surviving to this day. First and foremost, I am overjoyed at our success!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Over six months ago, when the Demonic Front was set up, I told all of you:
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
No matter what we do, Uruk will fall. I will not determine for you how you should meet that end.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
You can flee. You can drown in pleasures. You can throw yourselves down to the Underworld in despair.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
However, you all said you would fight. Despite knowing the end was coming, you were determined to resist.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Truly...Uruk was a fortunate city. Its history, its life, its people[line 3] Myself included.
[k]

＠Mash
King Gilgamesh...
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
The protection of gods is no longer needed in the world of man. As proof, I built a fortress, and you all answered to my call.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I know now, with certainty, that it was no mistake! And now this final trial will test it, and us, to the utmost.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Now is the time to deny the primordial god, and begin the age of man! Mind yourselves, my elite warriors!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
This is the battle for true separation from the gods! Give your lives to me, the king!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Pass on the glory that is Uruk to generations to come, to the last man!
