There are different kinds of sin. To harm others. To deceive others. To envy others. To take the lives of others.

These are all evils that mankind holds. These are all toxins that affect only mankind.

However... This is the oldest evil of them all. The Original Sin II... the sin of parting from ■, and leaving paradise.

Life was born from the sea. The primeval sea, Nammu, the goddess of the beginning.

To mankind, the goddess is the sea itself. The roaring of the waves became a voice to expose your sins.
