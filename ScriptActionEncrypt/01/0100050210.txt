Patient No. 99, severely wounded. The wound on the right arm is serious, I recommend amputation.

Here, too... I don't think it can be saved.[sr]Left femur shattered. It's a miracle that this one's alive.

＠???
We're going to have to amputate this as well.

？1：???

＠???
Gouge wound on the lateral region of the abdomen... No problem, as long as we remove the damaged organs and stitch it back up.
[k]

？1：???

？！

＠???
Don't worry, you'll still live. Your condition is far better than the other patients here.
[k]

＠???
In another 200 years, highly advanced artificial limbs should be developed... I suppose that's too far ahead.
[k]

＠???
Now then, it's time to amputate.

Normally, I would amputate those limbs to prevent the blood from reaching unnecessary areas...

And by keeping those wounds clean, we can prevent them from getting infected.

Don't worry, I am going to heal you, even if that means killing you.

In any case, what you've encountered was probably due to the Singularity.

I don't know what they are, and there are many mysteries about this army you've joined up with...

But what I can be certain of is that someone is trying to prevent the United States of America from being established.

If the United States isn't established, it will cause a logical error in this world.

Aside from the “anchor” that King Solomon used, I believe other powerful Servants are appearing in this era.
