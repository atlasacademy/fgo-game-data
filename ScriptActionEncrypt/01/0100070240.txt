＠Dr. Roman
We've been marching for an entire day.[sr]You must be tired, [%1].
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But we're almost there. Just hang in there a little longer.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That area is easy to observe.[sr]We can finally have a proper operation.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Just a little bit more... One more day, and you should arrive at what I believe is the city of Uruk.

＠Merlin
It's easy to observe this area because it's still close to the “former Mesopotamian world.”
[k]

＠Merlin
The only safe place is the area around Uruk, where the king is going strong and maintaining an environment livable for humans.
[k]

＠Merlin
Northern Mesopotamia has become a kingdom of Demonic Beasts, while the south has become a mysterious jungle that no one returns from.
[k]

＠Merlin
For humans who survived attacks by Demonic Beasts, the city of Uruk is the only refuge.

＠Dr. Roman
Now I understand the situation here.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
With the rise of the Three Goddess Alliance, the Sumerian city-states have been dealt a devastating blow.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Many cities have been destroyed and many people have fled to Uruk, the center of this world.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Demonic Beasts' invasion up north is the most serious issue at hand, as they're currently the major force wiping out humanity.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In response, Uruk's king has dissolved the city of Babylon and hastily constructed a great fortress known as the Northern Wall of Uruk.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In other words, Babylonia has turned itself into the front line for the war against Demonic Beasts. It's the last fort protecting the Mesopotamian world. Correct?
[k]

＠Merlin
Yes. It's still unknown how the King of Mages influenced this era, but if the Demonic Beasts bring down Uruk, human history is finished.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Merlin
If the first dynasty of Sumer, the blueprint of city-states, is destroyed, there is no certainty in what will become of the human race afterwards.
[k]

＠Merlin
During the same period, Egypt's first dynasty was also flourishing, but they alone can't preserve the Foundation of Humanity.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Merlin
Therefore, there are two things you need to do.
[k]

＠Merlin
First, search for the Holy Grail the King of Mages sent to this era and retrieve it. That should give us an idea about his plot.
[k]

＠Merlin
Next, take down the Three Goddess Alliance if possible. Although that fight should belong to the people of this era...
[k]

＠Merlin
...if we do nothing, the Foundation of Humanity can't be restored. This task is beyond our abilities, but it is what we must do.
[k]

？1：What do we know about the alliance?

[charaFace C 4]
＠Merlin
Not much. Out of the three goddesses, I only know the True Name for one.
[k]

＠Merlin
There's the goddess controlling all Demonic Beasts up north, the goddess residing in jungles in the south,
[k]

＠Merlin
then there's the soaring goddess who has no fixed residence.
[k]

＠Merlin
The biggest threat is the goddess in the north, but the soaring goddess is another problem altogether.
[k]

＠Merlin
In a way, she's the most troublesome goddess in Mesopotamia, even more so than the goddess controlling the Demonic Beasts.
[k]

＠Merlin
The people of Uruk are still puzzled over what to do about her.
[k]

？2：What were you doing, Merlin?

[charaFace C 1]
＠Merlin
I was looking for something, under orders from the king. That's also why I was in the Cedar Forest.
[k]

＠Merlin
I was searching for something called the Tablet of Destinies, but I've put that on hold so I can guide you to Uruk.
[k]

？！

Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes.[sr]The king of Uruk in ancient Mesopotamia.
[k]

＠Mash
He is a historical figure who appeared in the Epic of Gilgamesh, mankind's oldest heroic epic,
[k]

＠Mash
as well as other ancient Mesopotamian stories.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
His historical name was Bilgamesh, where “bilga” means ancestors, and “mesh” means hero.
[k]

＠Mash
His father was King Lugalbanda, a demigod.[sr]His mother was the goddess Ninsun.
[k]

＠Mash
He was a hero born of god and human, which made him a combination of the two.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
In his youth, he was fond of people, while also being a sage grounded in reason,
[k]

＠Mash
but he became the complete opposite in his adolescence. He turned into an out-of-control tyrant.
[k]

＠Mash
He gathered the land's fortune, demanded prosperity in toil from his citizens, and abandoned the gods as relics of the past.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
To admonish him, the gods created the being that appeared before us, Enkidu.
[k]

＠Mash
As fate would have it, Enkidu and King Gilgamesh fought for three days and three nights in front of a temple in Uruk.
[k]

＠Mash
The battle was a draw. Afterwards, King Gilgamesh recognized Enkidu as his only friend.
[k]

＠Mash
His tyranny relaxed a bit and he governed the country while still being feared by the citizens of Uruk.
[k]

＠Mash
However...
[k]

？1：However?

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Yes. King Gilgamesh matured as a king after gaining a friend, but encountered many trials.
[k]

？2：You know quite a bit, Mash.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Y-yes. After we found out about the era of the Seventh Singularity, I studied so I could be useful to you, Senpai...

＠Merlin
Oh, the Cedar of Lebanon story.
[k]

＠Merlin
King Gilgamesh set foot into the holy ground of the Forest of White Cedars and killed Humbaba, the Demonic Beast guarding it.
[k]

＠Merlin
Due to Mesopotamia's climate, the country was always in need of lumber.
[k]

＠Merlin
Bringing home quality cedar was his obligation, as both a king and a hero.
[k]

＠Merlin
However, his achievement captured the attention of a wicked goddess.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Merlin
The goddess's curiosity drove her to desire all things unusual, beautiful and praise-worthy.
[k]

＠Merlin
Who was this wicked goddess you ask? She was Inanna, Queen of Heaven, daughter of An, also known as Ishtar. And she set her sights on Gilgamesh.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Merlin
The world's greatest goddess confessed her love to the King of Heroes. However, King Gilgamesh rejected her.
[k]

＠Merlin
Why? Because Gilgamesh knew how coldly she treated her husband Dumuzid.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Merlin
This must have been quite a shock to Ishtar.[sr]To be rejected by a man... by a mere human!
[k]

＠Merlin
Furious, Ishtar went crying to her father...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Merlin
...who, out of love for her, gave her something terrible.
[k]

＠Merlin
A Divine Beast powerful enough to destroy the world... Gugalanna, the Bull of Heaven. With it, Ishtar tried to destroy Uruk.
[k]

＠Merlin
The bull damaged crops, made the rivers run dry, and summoned a tempest before being defeated by Gilgamesh and Enkidu.
[k]

＠Merlin
Uruk was saved, but by killing the holy beast, Enkidu incurred the wrath of the gods and for their sins, the gods killed Enkidu.
[k]

＠Merlin
It was, after all, the gods who created Enkidu in the first place. In modern parlance, the gods flipped Enkidu's off switch.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Merlin
Honestly. The Mesopotamian gods' greatest fault was being pushovers to their daughters.
[k]

＠Merlin
Between An and Enki of the Abyss, Ishtar was given a multitude of treasures.
[k]

[charaTalk B]
[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Yes, yes. From that story alone, it's easy to see that Ishtar had a pampered upbringing...

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 4]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Mash
That's right. The death of his only friend, Enkidu, was King Gilgamesh's first real encounter with mortality.
[k]

＠Mash
Death claimed even Enkidu, the mighty king's equal. Gilgamesh, in turn, began to wonder whether it was possible to conquer death.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
As a result, King Gilgamesh embarked on a quest for immortality. He went to the ends of the earth, descended into the Abyss...
[k]

＠Mash
...and at its bottom, obtained the Herb of Rejuvenation. However[charaFace A 12]...
[k]

[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 3]
＠Dr. Roman
It was stolen by a snake, right?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Gilgamesh returned to the surface and went to bathe. While he soaked, a snake crept in and ate the herb.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And so, snakes gained the ability to shed their skin, and humans forever lost the chance to become immortal.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
No one could ever really know what effect that had on the king's state of mind.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Anyway, King Gilgamesh returned to Uruk, but because of his absence, the city had nearly fallen into ruin.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Reflecting on his own selfishness, he decided to try and restore Uruk.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
From then on, he never went on quests, instead focusing on his kingly duties.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
There you have it. The Epic of Gilgamesh in a nutshell.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The epic was set down in poetry, so we can only imagine what the truth may have been.

＠Merlin
Did he really seek out the magical herb because he feared death, or was it because he loathed death?
[k]

＠Merlin
I think it would be interesting to ask the man himself.[sr]Oh, but...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Merlin
I suppose he isn't the type of person who would speak freely about his memories. Unless you were his traveling companion or something.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Merlin
The point is, this is a man who had the guts to call a goddess as powerful, though spoiled, as Ishtar a fool and kick her to the curb...
[k]

＠Merlin
...while bragging about possessing the originals of all the Noble Phantasms and having the greatest advantage over any hero.
[k]

＠Merlin
Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes, is an extremely arrogant, cold-blooded tyrant. Remember that.
