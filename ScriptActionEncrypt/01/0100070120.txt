The battle is over. We've only sustained minor injuries. However[line 3]

？1：It was an enemy type we've never seen before.

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes. I'm not sure how to describe it, but...[sr]It looked to be from a completely different ecosystem...
[k]

＠Mash
Unlike werebeasts, dragons, and other creatures that eventually disappeared from the world at the end of the Age of Gods...

We were prepared. We had data on of all the Phantasmals and Demonic Beasts from the Sumerian era.

＠Mash
It wasn't mere hostility. Their intention was to kill.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
All of the Demonic Beasts we've encountered thus far have attacked us out of bestial instinct, to feed themselves...
[k]

＠Mash
The Demonic Beasts just now, though, they attacked solely to kill us. I could feel the hatred in their eyes...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]

Hatred... Demonic Beasts that harbor hatred toward humans... Are you saying they're trying to annihilate us, not eat us?
