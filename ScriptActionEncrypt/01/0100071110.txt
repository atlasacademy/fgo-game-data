And you, shameless goddess, who came back with them! Tell me how it feels to have joined my army!

Nobody joined your army, you idiot!
[k]

＠Ishtar
I, the wise and farsighted goddess Ishtar, have simply entered into a business partnership with [%1]!
[k]

＠Ishtar
Just you wait. This one's going to be an amazing Master!
[k]

＠Ishtar
And until then, I'll bring [&him:her] back to life even if [&he:she] dies or explodes!
[k]

[charaFace E 6]
＠Ishtar
...Heh. There's no need to say who the real winner is here. And when that happens, this is what you'll be screaming:
[k]

[charaFace E 7]
＠Ishtar
“Oh, Ishtar! You truly are the goddess of victory! I am so very, very ashamed. Guess I'll have to kill myself!”
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Gilgamesh
I'm not going to die, you fool! I even liberated Eanna, your resting place, and you haven't repented at all!
[k]

[charaFace E 10]
＠Ishtar
Of course I haven't! I'm actually really mad![sr]Eanna was mine to begin with!
[k]

＠Ishtar
So why'd you steal it!?[sr]Argh! I knew I shouldn't have come!

Please, both of you, stop.

The patron deity appears before us... For a priestess such as myself, there is no greater honor.

＠Siduri
Let us forget about the damage report from the farmers, as well as the other things, and celebrate her return.

From the look of things, maybe King Gilgamesh and Ishtar will be able to work together!

＠Gilgamesh
Well, whatever. We can deal with rehabilitating you later. We have more pressing issues.
[k]

？1：Pressing issues...?
？2：You mean the Goddess of the Jungle?

？！

[charaFace F 1]
＠Gilgamesh
That's right. Now that we know Gorgon is an incarnation of Tiamat, we have a powerful weapon at our disposal that we can use against her...
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
The axe of the god Marduk, who ripped open Tiamat's throat, is still kept within Eridu.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
This axe will be the key to defeating Gorgon.

Eridu... The first city in Sumerian mythology where the divine right to rule was given.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But now it's covered in jungle.[sr]I see, so that's why...

＠Gilgamesh
I told you, there's an order in which to defeat the goddesses. First Ishtar. Then the one in the south.[sr]Then the one in the north.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
So, how about it, Ishtar? I bet you know who the Goddess of the Jungle really is.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Many of the heroes I've summoned so far have gone into the jungle, trying to learn exactly that. None returned.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Only a very powerful Divine Spirit could defeat such Servants.
[k]

？1：It's not Jaguar Warrior?

...Of course not. That's also a Divine Spirit, but it's only a secondary one. Next time, I'm skinning it for its pelt.

So we can just ignore her, then? Personally, I'm relieved.

After all, if she were one of the three goddesses, I have no idea how we'd deal with her!

...Well, I guess I could tell you that.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The goddess that holds dominion over the south is the “Winged Snake”...
[k]

＠Ishtar
A fellow goddess of Venus, and the great bird of the sun. The wind of Mesoamerica! Quetzalcoatl!

Wait, wasn't Quetzalcoatl male, anyway!?[sr]Why's she a goddess?

＠Ishtar
Oh, that's right. Humans wouldn't know.
[k]

[charaFace E 8]
＠Ishtar
The place you call Mexico[line 2]the region of Mesoamerica, that is[line 2]has a very different mythology.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Their gods are said to not be from this planet, but to have come from the sky.
[k]

＠Ishtar
When an asteroid collided with Earth, “something” that came with it survived and infected the plants...
[k]

＠Ishtar
Eventually it became a microscopic organism that changed the local animals into “gods,” and built that area's civilization.
[k]

[charaFace E 10]
＠Ishtar
The deities of Mesoamerica move from one human to another. One of those vessels was probably a female.

Quetzalcoatl... Hmm... With human history incinerated, I can't see the future of this Mesoamerica you talk about.

[charaFace F 2]
＠Gilgamesh
Doctor Roman! Gather information on this goddess!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I know nothing of any deities who were able to come back to life in the A.D. era!
