Whew. In spite of the Demonic Beast attacks along the way, it looks like you made it safely past the ruins.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This is...oh? It looks you're heading north?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Based on our mapping data, isn't Uruk to the southeast? I thought you'd go south down the Euphrates.

＠Enkidu
Oh, right. You do not know the current situation in Mesopotamia.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]
＠Enkidu
Let me start with that. To be blunt, humanity in Mesopotamia is on the brink of extinction.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Roughly 80% of the population here has been slaughtered.
[k]

＠Enkidu
The survivors are huddled in the city of Uruk, facing the ever-looming moment of extinction.

...Who is causing chaos in this era?[sr]Does that person have the Holy Grail?

[charaTalk B]
[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Yup, yup. We'd all think that, naturally.[sr]After all, the king of this era is the tyrant Gilgamesh.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's not hard to imagine him using the Grail's power to oppress his people and lead the world to destruction!
[k]

[communicationCharaClear]
[wait communicationChara]

？2：Is it the leader of the Demonic Beasts?

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
The boss of the Demonic Beasts we encountered in the ruins... That is indeed a possibility.
[k]

＠Mash
Many Demonic Beasts appear in myths, and Mesopotamian myths are no exception.
[k]

＠Mash
...Furthermore, in those Mesopotamian myths, there's a great goddess dubbed the “Mother of Demonic Beasts.”
[k]

＠Mash
If one of them has the Holy Grail...
[k]

？！

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠Enkidu
No, nobody has hold of the Holy Grail. Something other than the Mage King's followers is destroying this world.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Mesopotamia faces destruction by something equal to, if not greater than, the King of Mages.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Yes. To be blunt, the gods are the ones destroying humanity.
[k]

＠Enkidu
It's not the God you're thinking of.[sr]The gods of this era are different...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Enkidu
The Three Goddess Alliance has descended on this era and claimed roughly 60% of the lands of Mesopotamia.

[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 4]
＠Dr. Roman
No, she was a goddess that was forced to tag along with Orion, so I don't think she's powerful enough to destroy the world.

Hahaha, as the one who has been victimized the most, let me tell you this! Those three[communicationCharaFace 5] are devils indeed! Especially the oldest one!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
She lacks Authority because of her low rank among Divine Spirits, but if there are any male dictators, she can destroy the world another way!

＠Mash
No, all the goddesses we've encountered so far have been diminished somewhat in order to be contained in Servant form.
[k]

＠Mash
Their Spirit Origins have been on par with Heroic Spirits, so I don't think any have the Authority of a god.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Enkidu
Good. That is more understandable.[sr]This must be what you call a fragment of the spirit.

＠Enkidu
However, the goddesses that have appeared here in Mesopotamia are different.
[k]

＠Enkidu
It is true they are Divine Spirits summoned by someone, but their Spirit Origins are on the level of true gods.
[k]

＠Enkidu
The monsters we fought earlier were subordinates[line 2]no, it's better to say children[line 2]of one of the goddesses.
[k]

＠Enkidu
The Three Goddess Alliance is, as the name suggests, three female deities working together.
[k]

＠Enkidu
We know almost nothing about them, individually or as a group. Their objective, though, is crystal clear.
[k]

？1：...And that is?

？！

[charaFace D 5]
＠Enkidu
...The annihilation of the human race.[sr]Complete extinction. No survivors.
[k]

＠Enkidu
“Eradicate humanity here to cause everything rising from this era to die out.” That seems to be their objective.

＠Mash
Impossible... They're not just seeking to cause chaos in this era, but to annihilate mankind itself!?
[k]

＠Mash
That's no different from the King of Mages! If they're goddesses, aren't they on humanity's side!?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Enkidu
There's never been a time when gods allied with humans. Humans are nothing more than worker drones to the gods.
[k]

＠Enkidu
It is said the gods of Mesopotamia created humans to be “those who perform their jobs in their stead.”

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠Enkidu
Whatever the truth is, for gods, humans are objects to keep, not objects to love.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Gods who love humans merely suffer from a logical error due to being multifunctional.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Enkidu
Take the great goddess Inanna[line 2]known as Ishtar in Akkadian[line 2]for instance.
[k]

＠Enkidu
That goddess has a confusing nature unfit for a deity. She loves abundant harvests, man, war, and being at the top.
[k]

＠Enkidu
She claims to love humans, but favors war where humans kill each other. Isn't that contradictory?
[k]

？1：Well, yeah...
？2：That's a double standard...

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Enkidu
Right. That's why it's helpful to think of it as a kind of logical error.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Lack of uniformity from having too many elements and functions. Put simply, she's just insane.
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...Interesting interpretation. Contradictions are created from having too many functions...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In polytheism, the roles of the gods are subdivided into small parts. In other words, they are all specialists, so nothing is wasted.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's why so few gods have this error that makes them love humans. Is that what you're saying?
[k]

[communicationCharaClear]
[wait communicationChara]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 1]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠Enkidu
Yes. Usually the demiurge who possesses many functions and roles is the one that loves humans.
[k]

＠Enkidu
The more roles a god has, the more they make logical mistakes. Just like humans.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Enkidu
...Anyway, it's useless to preach about gods here.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Enkidu
The three goddesses that appeared here each used their own methods to destroy Mesopotamia.
[k]

＠Enkidu
The greatest force of the three drifted over from Greece: The “Goddess of Demonic Beasts.”
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Enkidu
...Yeah, you should see it soon. I think it's simpler if you see for yourself rather than trying to explain.
[k]

＠Enkidu
From this plateau, you have a clear view of the situation at the Northern Wall.
[k]

＠Enkidu
That is the first threat. The evil offspring of the Goddess of Demonic Beasts, who crushed the very center of this world.

？2：It looks like it has no end...

？！


＠Enkidu
Right. When Demonic Beasts filled the northern area, it was made with materials salvaged by dismantling Babylon.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Nowadays, it is called...
[k]

＠Enkidu
The largest and final fort that protects human hope and the four corners of the earth: Absolute Demonic Front Babylonia.
[k]

＠Mash
Amazing... Not as impressive as the Holy City's outer wall, but it's a tough wall that stretches out over the horizon.
[k]

＠Mash
Something is moving outside the wall... Are those the Demonic Beasts from earlier?
[k]

＠Mash
N-no, that's not possible! I see thousands of them!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
No, that's not all. To the north, I'm getting magical energy readings orders of magnitude greater!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Unbelievable. My goodness. There's no way humanity can possibly survive something like this!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Demonic Beasts earlier had power equal to a small autonomous tank! Now there're thousands of them! You can't possibly hold that off with a single wall!
[k]

＠Mash
Uh... Doctor... I can hardly believe what I'm seeing either, but... that's exactly what they're doing.
[k]

＠Mash
There appear to be soldiers outside the wall, and they seem to be holding against the rushing Demonic Beasts...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I-is that possible!? Just how powerful are these Sumerians!?
[k]

＠Enkidu
Do not be surprised by that.[sr]They have been holding that wall for six months already.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
S-Six months!? No human could do that!
[k]

＠Mash
Yes... But, it's amazing...[sr]They must be extremely proficient soldiers...

It is exactly as Mash has surmised.
[k]

＠Enkidu
The fortress city that fights Demonic Beasts day and night. An endless onslaught of Demonic Beasts driven back by its soldiers.
[k]

＠Enkidu
But the humans suffer fewer casualties... Precise army utilization. Seamless shift changes.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Training new soldiers even during combat, putting them on the front line, and having the wounded rest and concentrate on healing.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Enkidu
This is the ultimate form of point defense. At that rate, they should be able to hold the front line for another month.

For now, let's hurry to Uruk. The fact that military operations are in full force means that their commander[line 2]their king[line 2]stands strong.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If the threat upon Uruk isn't a king gone mad with the Grail, but this “Three Goddess Alliance,” negotiations will be simple.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Request an audience with the king, explain our objective, find the Holy Grail within this era, and recover it.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We'll think about dealing with that Northern Wall afterwards. Got that, [%1]?
