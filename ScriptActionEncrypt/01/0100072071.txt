You mock me. You, who could hardly handle the Laḫmu, and have lost Quetzalcoatl. You have nothing left.

Look at your Master's fingertips. They are on the verge of necrosis from the drain of magical energy.

You cannot even lift your shield.

You'll have to run while carrying [%1]. Or would you rather have me do the honors?

But once aboard my boat, Maanna, your Master is mine. Even if the Singularity gets repaired, I'm not returning them to Chaldea.

No one could have predicted Tiamat could fly. It's a miracle they stopped it.

If those two hadn't given their lives, Uruk would have fallen.

But we still don't have enough time! How's it going, not-so-great goddess?

Now there's a path for the Chaos Tide! Tiamat will be here in two hours!

How's work on the gate of the underworld going!?

Don't ask for the impossible! I'm pouring in magical energy, but it's just too big!

Even working ourselves to death all over again, we're just barely able to keep this pace up!

I can't get started on opening the gate!

Gah...! I thought that might be the case... Is there nothing we can do?

...No, such questions are pointless. That's why they're running back there right now.

[charaFace B 2]
＠Gilgamesh
Very well. Come forth, Tiamat! The entirety of Uruk will drive you back into the World of the Void!

＠Gilgamesh
Hurry and make your return, Master of Chaldea!

＠Gilgamesh
I will show you my final move, putting all Uruk on the line!
