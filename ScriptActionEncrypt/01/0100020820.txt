I'm used to it.[sr]So, uh, what were we talking about[line 2]

Right, that Mediterranean god![sr]Personally, I'd really like to find out about that.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

Are you sure?[sr]Don't you need to return to Rome?
[k]

＠Nero
I don't know what this ancient god may be, but what if it's truly one of the gods?
[k]

＠Nero
It's not impossible, right?[sr]There are Roman legends.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
For instance, Romulus the founder and first king of Rome became the newest god after he disappeared in lightning.
[k]

＠Nero
Things like that occasionally happen.[sr]Ancient gods. How amusing.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Further, assume they are gods of Rome. If the United[sr]Empire's "emperors" took that god away, we'd have bigger problems.

I don't want that.[sr]That's the one thing I absolutely cannot stand.

There's something I'm worried about.[sr]Something about Nero.
[k]

＠Boudica
It happened right after you got here.[sr]I wonder if you noticed.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Boudica
She occasionally spaces out. She been like[sr]that ever since the United Empire showed up.
[k]

＠Boudica
I think it might be just me, but when it happens,[sr]I feel a slight trace of magical energy.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Boudica
...She's a human from this era, not a mage.[sr]Still, I definitely feel it.

[k]

[charaFace G 5]

I wouldn't worry about her at all![sr]...It's not something I want to do personally.
[k]

＠Boudica
For better or for worse, she's the symbol of this land.[sr]If something happens to her, it would be a war lost.

I don't want to lose another war.[sr]That's the only reason I care about her.
