＠Dr. Roman
This is bad... The Allied Force is being pinned at the front gate. The Holy City guards are using this chance to make their move.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They'll be wiped out! We need to do something to get rid of the wall somehow!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It appeared out of nowhere. There has to be a way to make it disappear too!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Everyone, hurry and look around you! Do you see a way in, or maybe a generator!?

Hah, there's no such thing...!

You know, the Archer that was with you! Is he at the rear sniping again?!? Hey, show yourself!

...I see. So he died before I could beat him, huh? Damn it. He won and ran away.
[k]


？1：You two didn't fight.
？2：I don't think that's called running away...

？！

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Sure it is! He stopped Father's sacred lance!
[k]

＠Mordred
...I was never able to do that even until my death. I can't believe some minor no-name took that lance out first.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
Whatever. Just one less thing to look forward to! You're all gonna burn from Father's lance anyway!
[k]

＠Mordred
Now get ready, wimps! I'll at least give you the honor of dying by my hand!

I am indeed! It is a disgrace that you call yourself King Arthur's heir!

＠Bedivere
No matter how cruel you were, you once did your duties as a general.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Bedivere
But now there's not a trace of that! You fight alone! Without taking command of your men!
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Bedivere
And you look at this situation and think nothing of it? The king is trying to burn the world, and his own men!

＠Mordred
My Father's killing his own men? Of course... Of course he would!
[k]

＠Mordred
Listen! An army is the last thing the Lion King needs!
[k]

＠Mordred
The Lion King's idea is a city with no war. In that case, why would you need an army!?
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
We're going to protect the Holy City and die here! We'll be the Foundation of Humanity created by the Lion King!
[k]

＠Mordred
That's what the Lion King's Round Table is all about!

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
It was the honor of a knight, which you were given and we weren't!
[k]

＠Mordred
You were at King Arthur's side to the last. How would you know about our feelings!?
