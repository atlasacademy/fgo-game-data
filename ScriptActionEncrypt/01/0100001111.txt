Chaldea is finished. You humans have reached the moment of your destruction.

What do you mean?[sr]Is it related to being unable to see 2019?

[charaFace D 2]

It's not "related."[sr]It's the reality that this is the end.
[k]

Unable to observe the future, you babbled that it had "disappeared." That was truly wishful thinking.

The future didn't disappear. It was incinerated.[sr]The moment Chaldeas was dyed crimson.

Your end is certain.[sr]Your era no longer exists.

Chaldeas' magnetic field may be protecting Chaldea,[sr]but any outside of it will face the same fate as Fuyuki City.
[k]

We didn't lose contact with the outside world due to interference, we simply lost the outside world itself.

...But the end of that era[line 3][sr]Will still end up with its definitive result unchanged.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But these singularities are different.[sr]These are humanity's turning points.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
"What if this war didn't end?"[sr]"What if this naval voyage wasn't successful?"
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
"What if this discovery was wrong?"[sr]"What if this nation couldn't become independent?"
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The ultimate decision point to determine the current state of humanity.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Destroying them is like causing the foundation of human[sr]history to crumble. That's what these seven singularities are.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The future had already been decided when these seven[sr]singularities formed. As Lev said, humanity doesn't make it to 2019.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[line 3]But, we're different.[sr]Chaldea has yet to reach that future.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Do you understand? Only we can fix this mistake.[sr]Now we have a chance to return the singularities to normal.

＠Dr. Roman
So here's the deal.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Rayshift into these seven singularities and get history back on track.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's the only way to save humanity.[sr]However we are still powerless.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
All other Master candidates are frozen.[sr]Mash is the only Servant we have.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I realize you're being forced into this situation.[sr]Even so, I'll still say it.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Master Candidate #48, [%1].
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If you wish to save humanity...[sr]If you wish to have a future beyond 2018.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Then you alone must go and face these seven singularities in human history.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Are you prepared to do this? Can you shoulder[sr]the burden of Chaldea and humanity's future?
[k]

？1：Of course.

？2：If it's something I can do.

？！

＠Dr. Roman
[line 3]Thank you.[sr]With those words, our fate has been decided.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
We will now carry out the Prevervation of Humanity as laid out by Olga Marie Animusphere, former director of Chaldea.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Our objective is the protection and recovery of human[sr]history. Our search target will be each era's relic and Grail.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Our opponent is history itself. Many great Heroic[sr]Spirits and legends will stand against you.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Challenging them is an act of blasphemy against the[sr]past. To save humanity, we must defy human history.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But this is the only way to survive.[sr]No, the only way to take back the future.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...No matter what sort of end awaits us.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
To reflect our determination, we shall abandon the original mission name, First Order.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This is now Chaldea's last yet original mission.[sr]The Grand Order!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In the name of the magical world's highest order.[sr]We will take back the future!
