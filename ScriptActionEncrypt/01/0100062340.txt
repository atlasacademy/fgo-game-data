＠Holmes
Now, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1]. I'll leave the actual awakening of the Noble Phantasm to you.

＠Holmes
But I fear Hermes is not doing very well.[sr]One more search and it'll run out of power.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Holmes
...I should reflect on my actions as well.

＠Holmes
It would seem my plan to search for enchanting unsolved mysteries has somehow backfired...

The Lion King's sacred lance, Rhongomyniad.[sr]You must know why it exists.

Needless to say, I have heard of this name, as well.[sr]But, I have never set eyes upon it.

The lance that the Lion King possesses...[sr]How much do you know of it, Sir Bedivere?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Bedivere
Very little. The king had a number of holy artifacts aside from the sword.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Bedivere
I imagine Rhongomyniad is one of them. Even the Knights of the Round Table were not informed of it.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Bedivere
Merlin called it the “Tower at the Ends of the World.”
[k]

＠Bedivere
A pillar of light that stands far west of the Isle of Britain. A tower that stands beyond the horizon... at the edge of the world.

＠Holmes
There are two lances, Ms. Sanzang.
[k]

＠Holmes
The first is the massive tower that pierces this world: the lance in its physical form.
[k]

＠Holmes
It is an indication of the lance's strength. It would seem that it indeed exists as a tower, but it cannot be accessed by humans.
[k]

＠Holmes
Most importantly, it exists at the edge of this world. One can never reach the edge, no matter how much they walk.
[k]

＠Holmes
The tower stands at the edge of this world, seeing all of mankind, and protecting it.

[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Holmes
And the other is the lance that the Lion King wields. Think of this as the shadow that this tower casts upon the world.
[k]

＠Holmes
A personal weapon that allows the user to use the skills, the Authority of the tower.
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 12]

[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Holmes
A great analogy, Ms. Kyrielight.
[k]

＠Holmes
The tower will continue to exist at the edge of the world, while the lance is held by the tower's keeper.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
The only mystery that remains, is why the tower is pinned on this planet.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
There is a theory that our world, the human world, is nothing more than a texture placed upon the surface of this planet.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Holmes
Our understanding as this planet's ruling intelligent lifeform... the laws of physics as we know it...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
The texture that results from this understanding is our world. And it is sewn tightly to this planet so as not to be removed.
[k]

＠Holmes
What keeps it in place, my friends, is the phenomenon known as the “Tower at the Ends of the World.” And, this tower is not limited to the Isle of Britain, either.
[k]

＠Holmes
There are several around the world. One of which is the sacred lance currently in the Lion King's hands.

[charaFace E 0]
＠Sanzang
It's like a pagoda, a vessel for receiving faith. I get it.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Sanzang
But, how is that related to the state of the Holy City? What does the Lion King intend to do with it?

[charaFadeout B 0.1]
[charaFadeout E 0.1]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Holmes
...Most likely, the Lion King intends to use the lance as the tower.
[k]

＠Holmes
The Lion King intends to create an ideal world at the Holy City by gathering only the chosen ones.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
Not simply a pure human being, but one that will always do the right thing, no matter what.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
According to Hermes' calculations, the sacred lance can store up to 500 souls.
[k]

＠Holmes
The Holy City was built over the Holy Land in a single night. It seemed impossible, but not until you understand why...
[k]

＠Holmes
That city is the sacred lance itself. People that were brought to the city have all been sealed inside it.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
The Lion King claims he is quarantining pure humans, but the truth is that he is not letting them get away. It's an elaborate trap.

True, the Castle of Camelot was created by fairies.[sr]It's no wonder it appeared overnight.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...But that's not right. I had a really bad feeling, from the moment I saw it.
[k]

＠Mash
That's the outer shell of Rhongomyniad.[sr]It is not something that will save humanity.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]
＠Bedivere
Then...what will happen to all of the people inside the Holy City? They must live lives of captivity while being protected by the King.

＠Holmes
To live or to die...that is not the issue. All those in the Holy City will be consumed by the lance.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
The sacred lance is similar to the Atlas Institute.[sr]It's a shelter, Sir Bedivere.
[k]

＠Holmes
However, there is no room to exist as a lifeform. All of them are being herded, as virtuous human elements.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Holmes
Eventually the Holy City will converge and become a single tower. Inside of that tower is a smaller version of hell.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
The people have not been gathered in this so-called utopia to live. They are samples.
[k]

＠Holmes
To be stored for all eternity, underneath the Lion King's command. As though displayed in a case to show the value of mankind.

[charaFace E 2]
＠Sanzang
There's a huge mistake! What are you talking about, Touta?
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
Let me finish! Now, listen... So, the Holy City has been turned into this tower.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
Then, what will happen next? I believe the tower will disappear along with the Lion King's army.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
At the very least, the mountain people and the Lion King will have no reason to fight...because he will fade, along with his ideals.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Sanzang
Hm, you're right... I suppose that would technically put an end to the conflict. Technically.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_2 1.5]

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Holmes
Correct. The Lion King intends to turn the Holy City into the Tower at the Ends of the World. Surely you know what that means?
[k]

＠Holmes
When the tower is complete, the entire area will become the Ends of the World.
[k]

＠Holmes
In exchange for creating the complete world known as the tower, the world outside it must be destroyed.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
The Lion King is not simply trying to protect his own people. He's going to eliminate all other people aside from his own.
[k]

＠Holmes
And that destruction has already begun.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

The reason this Singularity has been an exception within an exception is because it exists “nowhere in this world.”

The King of Mages is no longer the one who's trying to destroy this era, nor the one that created it.
