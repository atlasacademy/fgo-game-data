＠E：???
[line 2]That sums up Nero Claudius' army.
[k]

＠E：???
All the details are in the report.[sr]Look it over later.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠E：???
One comment from me.[sr]Think of the enemy commander, Lu Bu as a disaster.
[k]

＠E：???
The same goes for Spartacus.[sr]It's no use confronting them head-on.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠E：???
That said, these disasters can be dealt with.[sr]The two Berserkers are like automatic machines.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠E：???
It should be easy to "lure" them.[sr]Luckily, they didn't materialize as other classes.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：???
Guess our luck is turning.[sr]Were my Luck parameters that high?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠E：???
Luck that's already played out is nothing but reality.[sr]Meaning that reality is working in your favor, nothing more.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠F：???
Oh? You can look at it that way too, I guess.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：???
It doesn't matter either way.[sr]I want to see her face.
[k]

＠F：???
Nero Claudius.[sr]The fifth emperor of the Roman Empire.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：???
What kind of king is she?[sr]No, what kind of emperor is she, I should say.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠E：???
I will make your wish come true.[sr]No matter what.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠F：???
Thank you, but I kind of feel weird.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠F：???
I'm what you may consider a curveball as a Heroic Spirit, so my "memory" is a little different too.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：???
It seems a little bit off, that you became my teacher.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠E：???
Those are my words. Can you imagine being sent back in time, and becoming a vessel for a Heroic Spirit I have no connections with.
[k]

＠E：???
What happened to me in my own era?[sr]Did I switch with this Heroic Spirit?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠E：???
Or did the time in "my era" stop, and I'm here[sr]as myself, integrated with this Heroic Spirit?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠E：???
...I have no idea what's going on.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：???
But you came here anyway.[sr]As my new teacher.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：???
Right, Mr. Zhuge Liang.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠E：???
No. Well, as a Heroic Spirit, that may be true.

And[line 2]
[k]

＠Mash
The true Roman Empire Army has started its attack.[sr]The United Empire is being invaded.
[k]

＠Mash
Jing Ke already came back with intel. A city[sr]resembling Rome indeed exists in the specified location.
[k]

＠Mash
This is the place Stheno was talking about.[sr]This is the real blessing from the goddess.
[k]

＠Mash
Boudica and Spartacus of Gaul, along with Lu Bu and Jing Ke.
[k]

＠Mash
An army commanding five Servants, including me.[sr]That is the true Roman Imperial Army led by Emperor Nero.
[k]

＠Mash
It's a force that no standard army can match. Yet the[sr]United Empire force won't send in their Servants.
[k]

＠Mash
No sign of Lev Lainur either.[sr]Everyday, we advance further.
[k]

＠Mash
We certainly have the upper hand now.[sr]The Imperial Army is marching toward the enemy capital with unbelievable momentum.
[k]

＠Mash
In the meantime, I[line 2]

That's right, I'm the one who asked. To take[sr]advantage of the fact that you became a Roman viceroy!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
What do you think about "Novus Commentarii de Bello[sr]Gallico"? This title is an homage to the book written by Caesar.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
That sounds interesting, right? Though you do have[sr]to cover the part where a god showed up...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]

I suppose you're right.[sr]Well then, let's talk about something serious!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Let's assume you guys could save the world.[sr]I thought about what would come after that.
[k]

Even if the world is saved, the tragedy of Chaldea will never be reversed.

Oh, it's a joke, it's a joke. Why would I count my[sr]chickens before they hatch when the world's about to end?

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
What's happening in Rome is exactly like a war.[sr]In order to grasp the situation correctly, I just use the best means.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I understand its purpose now.[sr]In that case, I will dispose of this journal right away.

Regarding the war record, I will deliver it to Da Vinci later.
