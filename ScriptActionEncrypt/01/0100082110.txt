All right, we have communication![sr]I hope you are okay, [%1]!

＠Da Vinci
We just confirmed the collapse of the throne room![sr]The King of Mages[line 2]I mean, Goetia is gone, too!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Da Vinci
But there's no time to savor the victory. The temple is crumbling and the band of light is unstable, too!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The power binding all the magical energy together must have vanished with Goetia's defeat.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Da Vinci
At this rate, it'll lose its ring form and revert to its natural state: as mana that will diffuse into the atmosphere.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Da Vinci
If that happens, there won't be anything left of the Singularity.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It'll explode like a supernova![sr]Get back to Chaldea before that happens!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Da Vinci
Chaldea is safe. I've taken care of it.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If you can use the dimensional fissure in the throne room to make it back to the holy gate, I can Rayshift you.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But if the floor crumbles, you won't be able to get to the holy gate. Whether the band of light's diffusion or the temple's collapse comes first is... well...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Da Vinci
Anyway, hurry back. We can talk details after that.

Obviously. Only the Beasts possess the power to manifest independently.

Any true Heroic Spirit would begin crumbling the moment we appeared in this space.

＠Gilgamesh
No. From here on out, what happens should be for humans alone. Neither you nor I are meant to be part of it.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Goetia, the Beast who knew no love. An Evil of Humanity fueled only by his own grief. One who sought nothingness.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
...It's ironic. The Evils of Humanity themselves represent a love for the human race.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
All that destruction, it wasn't because Goetia hated humans, or harbored any malice toward them. Malice is temporary. It fades so very easily.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
That's why...the threat to humanity truly rises from the very wish to protect it.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Wishing for a better future threatens the current peace.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Gilgamesh
Hmph. Thinking of it that way, I suppose the Beast managed to shake itself free from that cycle.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Gilgamesh
To be honest, I don't really know a great deal about those Beasts, since I do not possess the Grand title.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
But, it's said they manifested like a chain reaction.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
In a world where one of the Evils of Humanity reared its head, other calamities, culminating in “The Final Evil,” will appear.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Since Beast I has manifested, I'm sure the final one, Beast VII, is somewhere in this world too.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Whatever shape the Beasts of Calamity take, it falls to humanity to combat them.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Gilgamesh
I don't care how it turns out. But you should watch over them, and help them as much as you can.
[k]


＠Gilgamesh
Now get moving. Unless you want to stay here and sacrifice yourself to that great fool, King Solomon.

Everything I did here in this temple, all the time I spent planning... All of it, for naught.

...That's right. I lost.

＠Goetia
The band of light is vanishing. The Incineration of Humanity will be reversed. The moment King Solomon ceased to exist, all of my work was undone.

I, too, am no longer the 72 Demon God Pillars.[sr]This is all that remains.

I'm going to stop you in order to protect the one thing I cannot possibly relinquish. And you're going to stop me so you can return home alive.

...I have said what I needed to say.

＠Goetia
So, let us begin, and bring an end to this quest.

＠Goetia
O Master who overcame seven Singularities in seven worlds... Your Grand Order is all about the Incineration of Humanity.
[k]

＠Goetia
My name is Goetia. I am the one who used humanity to destroy humanity. The one who strove for what lay beyond.
[k]

＠Goetia
A climax with no one around.[sr]...I strove for an empty wish that none truly wanted.
[k]

＠Goetia
I am born now and I shall perish now.
[k]

＠Goetia
This battle may be without resolution or reward, but I shall put my entire being on the line to crush you.
[k]

＠Goetia
...My sworn enemy. My hatred. My destiny.
[k]

＠Goetia
I want you to witness this.[sr]This brief moment is now my story.
[k]

＠Goetia
This brief but precious time has given the creature called Goetia true life.
