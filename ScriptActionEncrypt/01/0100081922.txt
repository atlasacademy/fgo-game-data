According to legend...
[k]

＠
Though King Solomon had rings that granted him true omnipotence, he used them only once.
[k]

＠
And in the end, he chose to return them to Heaven of his own free will.
[k]

＠
He seemed to be saying that the era in which fate rested in the hands of the Almighty was over, and the era in which humans would live freely had come.

Goetia, let me teach you the final magecraft.

＠Solomon
You knew that Solomon had one last Noble Phantasm, but you were never able to learn its True Name[line 3]
[k]

＠Solomon
No, it was never possible for you to do so.
[k]

＠Solomon
You possess nine rings, and I possess the tenth.
[k]

＠Solomon
And now, with all the rings here, I can recreate that moment.
[k]

＠Solomon
I can recreate Solomon's true first Noble Phantasm.[sr]I can recreate the one “human” heroic legend about me.

Yeah, it's strange. We saw the same things, sat on the same throne, and spent the same time together.

But Solomon and you reached completely antithetical conclusions. If there was a difference between us, it would be...

To put it simply, I just didn't have the freedom to get mad. That may be the thing that most separated us.

It's not that simple...![sr]You just gave up being a Heroic Spirit!

It's not about giving up one's life. ...It's the complete abandonment of one's existence, one's everything!

＠Goetia
Everything Solomon made will become worthless.[sr]The Temple of Time will lose its power.

＠Goetia
We 72 Demon Gods will cease to be a colony, and go back to being individual demons...

Neither King Solomon nor his works will ever appear on Earth again!

You know that! You're about to disappear from even the Throne of Heroes!

My band of light is nothing compared to that![sr]You will experience true nothingness!

An end no human has ever reached... The complete annihilation of your being! And you did it to yourself!?

That doesn't mean I will die. But, from here on, Solomon will disappear from the Throne of Heroes.

＠C：Romani Archaman
The agent of God will disappear from human history. The world shall be ruled by the laws of physics, by human knowledge.

＠C：Romani Archaman
...With the complete annihilation of Solomon, King of Mages, the Age of Gods will truly come to an end.

＠C：Romani Archaman
Yeah. It's scary, and sad, but it was something only I could do. And since that's the case, I have to do it, no matter how painful it is.

＠C：Romani Archaman
This is the right thing to do.[sr]You and Mash taught me that.

＠Goetia
I'm sick of it! No matter what happens, they just disappear, and only fear remains!

Of course nothing is eternal, and pain awaits us all in the end.

＠C：Romani Archaman
But that doesn't make life a story of despair. Not at all.
[k]

＠C：Romani Archaman
It's a fight against death and separation in what precious little time one is given. It's a repetition of meeting and parting, despite knowing there's an end.
