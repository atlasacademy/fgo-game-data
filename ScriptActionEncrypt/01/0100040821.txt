＠Mash
Battle is over, Senpai.[sr]Good work.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I don't see Helter Skelters around,[sr]but we still ran into something troublesome...
[k]

？1：Those were...

？2：I remember that shape.

？！

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
Yes, Senpai. The enemy has a striking resemblance[sr]to the magical tome we saw in Soho.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
But this time our attacks worked...[sr]Without Andersen giving them a name.
[k]

＠Mash
Normal attacks alone were sufficient.[sr]They also didn't change form...

＠Jekyll
May I speak? This is just a guess,[sr]but I think those are a type of transformed grimoire.
[k]

＠Jekyll
Maybe the Demonic Fog transformed the tomes[sr]that were kept underground with the Mage's Association.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
(Oh...[sr]I was thinking the same thing, but he said it first...)

...A swarm of attacking books, huh?

...It was like a nightmare, or perhaps a vision of hell.

Don't be stupid.[sr]Those things weren't even...

To burn a book! It is something inconceivable![sr]Oh, how sad...but there was a joy in it!
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Wrongdoings that should ne'er be done. Unforgivable[sr]acts of barbarism! There should only be sadness, yet...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Shakespeare
I cannot help but feel a moment of forbidden joy![sr]Oh, my God!
[k]

[charaFace H 2]
＠Andersen
No books are needed except my own.[sr]Actually, I'd prefer to even burn my own works!

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
If there were no books in the world! No need[sr]to lament of the many great works I'll never read!

＠Andersen
If there were no books in the world![sr]I'd never have to scream, "Who published this trash!?"

If there were no books in the world![sr]I'd never have to worry about deadlines!

A-Anyway, Senpai.[sr]This makes our path clear, doesn't it?
[k]

＠Mash
When the book-type enemies appeared,[sr]they formed a path to the underground by chance[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah. Once the author Heroic Spirits calm down,[sr]it's time to go underground!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm so excited.[sr]This is like the headquarters of the Mage's Association.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I wonder what it's like down there?[sr]Oh, I wish I could go and see for myself.

Then you should come.[sr]Instead of just being a voice.

O-Okay![sr]Back to my observation work!
