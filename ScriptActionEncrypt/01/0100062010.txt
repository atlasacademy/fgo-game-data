＠Lancelot
...Why was the sacred lance unleashed? Sir Tristan setting fire to the battlefield was already excessive.
[k]

＠Lancelot
Dropping the Light of Judgment on top of that was simply cruel. Thus far, Your Majesty has brandished the sacred lance to rule these wastelands.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Lancelot
But, even for rebellions, not once has the Light of Judgment been unleashed upon human settlements.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Lancelot
...Under these pressing circumstances, we utilize fear to speed up governance. We've believed that this is the righteousness of the Lion King.
[k]

＠Lancelot
But using the sacred spear against a village is wrong. That is not justice. That is not even fear.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Lancelot
My king. Why do such a thing to the village? I would like to hear the true intention behind it.
[k]

＠Lancelot
...Even more so if it was not Your Majesty's decision but that of someone else... the opinion of someone who keeps the government.
[k]

＠Lancelot
Are you other knights not curious of that, too? Whether the king's decision was really his own?

Stand down, Agravain. ...Heh. For some reason, you grow short-tempered when Lancelot is your opponent.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Lion King
And hear me, my knights. The enforcement through my sacred lance was entirely of my own volition.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Lion King
The reason I have never dropped it on a human settlement is clear. Burning down a village would only fan the flames of rebellion.
[k]

＠Lion King
The bonds of the mountain people would only strengthen, and they may even prepare an army to invade the Holy City.
[k]

＠Lion King
That would be unnecessary. Until preparations with the sacred lance are complete, I have no time to spare on insignificant scuffles.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

However... The sacred lance has entered the final stages. The Tower at the Ends of the World will finally be welcoming us.

...Our greatest enemy was time.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Lion King
We had to open the tower before that king entered the next stage after the Incineration of Humanity.
[k]

＠Lion King
And that is about to take place. The defiance of the mountain people is but a trifle.
[k]

＠Lion King
Therefore, I launched the direct enforcement of the village. If the rebellious forces rise up because of it, all the better.
[k]

＠Lion King
If it be but a small number that reach the Holy City in a fight to their death, Sir Gawain can manage their extermination on his own.

This was my true intention. Have you any objections, Sir Lancelot?
