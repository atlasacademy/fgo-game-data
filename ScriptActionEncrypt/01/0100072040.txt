＠Dr. Roman
Tiamat's still speeding up! This is bad! She's going to reach the Fangs of Napishtim soon!

＠Dr. Roman
If it's destroyed, the Chaos Tide will flood into Uruk!

＠Dr. Roman
If that happens, Uruk will be reduced to nothingness before Tiamat even reaches it...!
[k]

？1：I know. Just a little further...!

You'll go flying if you don't pay attention! Make sure you lower your center of gravity and hang on!
