＠Berserk Assassin
I can't believe you couldn't finish off a young girl...[sr]I wonder if you felt sympathy for her.
[k]

＠Berserk Assassin
Kindness doesn't suit you.[sr]It's not very monster-like, Dracul.

＠Berserk Lancer
Who knew that you'd reveal my True Name in front of others. I'm extremely displeased.
[k]

＠Berserk Assassin
What's wrong? I would rather be remembered by a bad name than not at all.
[k]

＠Berserk Assassin
Besides... I prefer to be called by my True Name.[sr]Dread and despair, faintly spiced with hope.
[k]

＠Berserk Assassin
The ones with the best cries are the little squirrels who think "I can escape."
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Berserk Lancer
But in the end, you were driven to ruin by the hands of those who actually escaped.
[k]

＠Berserk Lancer
Elisabeth Báthory. Otherwise known as Carmilla.[sr]How humorous your tragic end was.
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Berserk Assassin
How boring. That's why I don't like your kind.[sr]Even as you're damned as a vampire, you still cling to your noble "heart."
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Berserk Lancer
[line 3]You mean to say that I cling to my faith even now?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Stop this instant. I told you that you could devour freely,[sr]but do not forget who is friend and foe.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
Turn your animosity to those little girls now.[sr]Save your petty squabbles for later.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Berserk Assassin
Ah, you misunderstand, Master.[sr]Secretly, I idolize Count Vlad as a leader.

＠Berserk Lancer
That's the first I've heard of it.[sr]Comparing idolizing with plotting assassination.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Wow... They're fighting amongst themselves...[sr]It's a bad work environment, over there.
[k]

＠Mash
Do not let your guard down, Master.[sr]They still intend to kill us!
