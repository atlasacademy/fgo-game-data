Everyone, I thank you for gathering here in the Holy City of your own accord.

＠Gawain
Humanity's time has ended and this small world is marching toward ruin.

His Majesty has cast judgment. There is no place for people to live on this earth, in any land.

＠Gawain
That is, with the exception of our Holy City of Camelot.

Our Holy City is a complete, perfect, pure-white, millennial kingdom. Beyond this gate awaits an ideal world.
