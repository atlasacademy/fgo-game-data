＠Shakespeare
The British Museum! A symbol of the British Empire![sr]Or rather, what remains[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Shakespeare
Oh, what a sorrowful sight! This museum once held[sr]so many of humanity's greatest treasures!
[k]

＠Shakespeare
I cannot help but sigh.[sr]This building once held human progress itself.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Shakespeare
Can such a thing be allowed! Oh![sr]'Tis like the burning of the Library of Alexandria!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Shakespeare
Truly, a shame[line 3]
[k]

＠Shakespeare
However, however.[sr]This is the way of humanity as well.

Foolishness and grieving are human traits.[sr]"You, gods, will give us some faults to make us men."

...It's no different than the last time I was here.[sr]Rubble. Ruin. Nothing else.
[k]

＠Mordred
Whoever destroyed this place must've had a[sr]personal grudge. There's no survivors.

So this is the British Museum...or what's left.[sr]I'd seen it, but just in image data...
[k]

＠Mash
Nowhere else in London were buildings destroyed.[sr]Just here...
[k]

？1：It's sad.

？2：I don't like destroyed buildings.

Start digging here. According to Jekyll,[sr]the Clock Tower spread underground as well.
[k]

＠Andersen
Despite the thorough wreckage, the ground is intact.[sr]That means what we're after is underground.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
But, unfortunately, the stairs are buried in rubble.[sr]So[line 3]You see?
[k]

[charaFace H 2]
＠Andersen
Time to show off the ridiculous strength of Servants![sr]Now go smash stuff like a bulldozer!

I-I'll help. Yeah.[sr]I probably won't be of much use though.

Hmm... It's true. There's something here.[sr]What is this?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You don't see anything, right?[sr]But it's there. And it's moving around.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's not the Mystic Codes scattered in the rubble, either.[sr]Which means there's only one answer!
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠Jekyll
It's from below!?[sr]Saber, sorry, but get ready[line 3]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
Don't treat me like you're my Master![sr]I know! If they come out, we'll fight them!
