Air temperature 48 degrees Celsius, relative humidity 0 percent, atmospheric mana density 0.3 milligrams...

...This is awful. This isn't an environment for humans to live in.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The desert sandstorm was rough, but this is just as harsh... It's exactly as I expected, too.
[k]

？1：As you expected?
？2：What do you mean?

？！

＠Da Vinci
This is the King of Mages' work. He created a Singularity by disturbing the Foundation of Humanity.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
As a result, human history has become unstable. Everything up to where the King of Mages crosses history is incinerated.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Conversely, it meant Singularities themselves were safe from the waves of humanity incineration...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But if the Foundation of Humanity is this disturbed, even Singularities would be no exception.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
My conclusion is that this land will be incinerated in time. That's the reason why King Ozymandias doesn't use the Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It makes sense, right? In the end, this land would fall to ruin even without using the Grail.

...They've partially turned into ghouls.[sr]At this point, they're finished as human beings.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They can only live through hate, envy, and harming others now. They likely won't survive for long, either.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That's the kind of place this era has become.[sr]We've come here to fix that, to reject such an era.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

To do that, you must wield your sword, Master.[sr]The time has come to discard your innocence.
