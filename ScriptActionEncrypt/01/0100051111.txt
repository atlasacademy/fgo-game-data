I-I can't fight like this, I can't help it![sr]I'd love to fight if I could!

No, I meant the opposite. That's a good thing. I thought you were some playboy prince, but you're actually really nice.

＠Elisabeth
Okay, I feel more motivated! Leave these weaklings to me. I'll make sure you see your wife again!

＠Rama
Y-Yes... That's right. I just hope I have the chance to apologize...
