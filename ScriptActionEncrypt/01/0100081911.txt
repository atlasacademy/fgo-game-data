...It was like time had stopped.

＠
Nothing on Earth existed that could stop those bands of light. But that was only if one thought in terms of physical laws.
[k]

＠
Her defense was a shield of the psyche.
[k]

＠
If there was no impurity, and no hesitation within it, its invincible walls would never melt or break.
[k]

＠
I knew that. I knew that, of course.
[k]

＠
The walls of her castle could defend against even my Third Noble Phantasm. But that meant[line 3]

＠Mash
Aaah... Aaaaaahh!
[k]

＠
That hellish moment continued. As she blocked the heat that would pierce the planet, she thought...
[k]

＠
She thought of the journey so far and the journey to come. She thought of her past, and of the future she would not be there for.
[k]


＠Mash
...I'm glad. This should open up an opportunity for you, Master.
[k]

＠Mash
Thank you for everything.
[k]

＠Mash
I wanted to pay you back for everything you gave me... That's why I was able to put my own weakness aside and push ahead, Senpai...
[k]

＠Mash
And now, finally, I really feel like my life had value.
[k]

＠Mash
...Like Captain Drake said, at the very end, I realized my wish.
[k]

＠
...That's right. That's why we wanted your approval.
[k]

＠Mash
...But I regret one thing.

I was always the one that was protected[line 3]

＠Mash
So at least once, I wanted to be useful to Senpai.

...That is right. Even after all those battles, it still was not nearly enough for her.
[k]

＠
That was how strong her gratitude toward[sr][%1] was.
[k]

＠
Even if it all started with a simple chance meeting one morning...
[k]

＠
She was always protected by [%1], and she was able to fight because[sr][%1] was there.

Behold the result. Her body could not take the heat from the bands of light, and evaporated.
[k]

＠
But her heart remained untouched, and her snowflake shield remained unscathed as it protected her Master to the end.
[k]

＠
...That's why I say that she was neither a brave warrior, nor the protagonist of the story.
[k]

＠
In the end, she was simply an ordinary girl.
