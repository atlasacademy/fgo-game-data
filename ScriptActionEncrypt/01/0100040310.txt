＠Jekyll
I understand your situation now, more or less. Now, let[sr]me tell you of the city's circumstances that we're aware of.
[k]

＠Jekyll
Each night for the past three nights,[sr]a lethal fog has descended upon London.
[k]

＠Jekyll
If you wear a mask in an area where the fog is thin,[sr]you probably won't die from it.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Jekyll
But it's no good where it's thick. Normal creatures[sr]will be corrupted by the magical energy just by breathing it.
[k]

＠Jekyll
It probably depends on one's predisposition,[sr]but in the worst cases, death comes within an hour.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Jekyll
I don't have the exact numbers, but according to[sr]my calculations, several hundred thousand have died.
[k]

＠Jekyll
There are areas that have become ghost towns already.[sr]The East End is just about wiped out.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Jekyll
It's only a matter of time before the entire city[sr]is nothing but ruins.
[k]

＠Jekyll
It's all because of that fog. An extraordinary dense fog[sr]laced with potent magical energy[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Jekyll
For now, we're[sr]calling it Demonic Fog.
[k]

[charaFadeout F 0.1]
[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 12]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Mash
London, covered by a deadly fog... It's slightly similar[sr]to an incident that will occur in the 20th century.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Is it off by a century?[sr]That's probably what the Singularity is... But...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'll look at the 20th century case, too. I had thought this[sr]was a one city deal, but it's getting pretty complicated.

＠Jekyll
These past three days[line 3]on top of the Demonic Fog,[sr]London has been plagued with other types of threats.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Jekyll
Those committing atrocities under cover of the fog.[sr]Automatas made of magecraft, killer homunculi...
[k]

＠Jekyll
Helter Skelter[line 3]
[k]

＠Jekyll
And there's a serial killer.[sr]The newspapers call them "Jack the Ripper."
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
The newspapers?
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Jekyll
Yes, the newspapers were still being printed[sr]on the first day of the Demonic Fog... Though no longer.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Jekyll
Understandably, it seems neither Scotland Yard[sr]nor the government has a handle on the situation.
[k]

＠Jekyll
Government functions are already starting to freeze up.[sr]External support is hindered by the fog, isolating London.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Jekyll
It's already been three days.[sr]A cooped-up populace won't last long.
[k]

＠Jekyll
The Demonic Fog doesn't go indoors,[sr]but once food and water runs out, London will perish.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...That's horrifying. The situation requires quick response.[sr]All right then, Mr. Jekyll and Mordred.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I have a proposal. We'd like you to help us search for[sr]the Holy Grail, the likely origin of this situation.

While they make the circle,[sr]I'll help you pass the time.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Da Vinci
Previously, I spoke about Servant class affinity,[sr]so I think I'll expand on that.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Just as each Heroic Spirit has a story to tell, they have[sr]classifications that explain how they were born.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
There are three attributes: Heaven, Earth, and Human.[sr]Most Servants fall under one of these categories.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Heaven includes Divine Spirits demoted to Heroic Spirits,[sr]children of gods, and embodiments of legends.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Earth includes legendary heroes that took hold in the[sr]land, fairies, and Demonic Beasts.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Da Vinci
Human is for heroes and great people who actually[sr]existed. I'm included in this group, as a great artist who actually existed.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
Heaven wins over Earth, but loses to Human.[sr]Earth wins over Human, but loses to Heaven.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And Human wins over Heaven, but loses to Earth.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Da Vinci
...Humans believe in gods. However,[sr]gods that they stop believing in become "nonexistent."
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Native heroes and fairies have nothing to do with faith.[sr]However, they are no match for the gods that created them.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Da Vinci
...And there are rare, special Heroic Spirits[sr]that do not belong in any of the three attributes.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They are an exception of exceptions.[sr][line 2]The Heroic Spirits of the Star.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Da Vinci
They do not belong to Heaven, Earth, or Human.[sr]Yet they exist on earth under heaven, and are born of humans.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Servants of the Star have nothing to do with Heaven,[sr]Earth, or Humans. After all, they're an exception.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
That said, these are nothing more than categories.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The effects aren't as pronounced as Class affinity,[sr]so it's not worth integrating into a strategy.

Dr. Frankenstein was a scientist. But the person[sr]he was modeled after was a real-life mage.

[charaFace A 0]

Yes. Strictly speaking,[sr]magecraft and science are contrary to each other.

＠Mash
Chaldea's existence is an extreme exception, and if you[sr]think about it, both globally and historically[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Oh yes, but everything has an exception. In a certain era,[sr]science and magecraft virtually meant the same thing.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
For example, even if you set aside ancient times,[sr]some will say alchemy is the origin of chemistry.
