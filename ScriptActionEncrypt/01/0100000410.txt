The hostile lifeform has been removed.[sr]Let's move on.

＠Olga Marie
I didn't know what would happen with that monster, but I expected nothing less of a Servant's body. Such power.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Not that it makes them look any less scary...[sr]By the way Director, I have a question for you.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The Fuyuki in our data, and this Fuyuki are just too different.
[k]

＠Mash
What happened in this city, exactly?[sr]What are your thoughts, Director?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Olga Marie
Let's see, history must've been slightly disrupted.[sr]That's the only reason I can think of.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Mash, [%1].[sr]I'm only going to say this once, so listen up.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Chaldea observes the future through an Earth model[sr]called Chaldeas. At the same time, a familiar called Laplace compiles past records.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
You can say it is Laplace's job to gather data on history that wasn't made public, and information that was buried in darkness that no one knows.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
According to Laplace's observations, an unusual Holy Grail War was confirmed in this city in 2004.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Holy Grail War?[sr]You mean the Holy Grail from the legend?
[k]

＠Mash
The magical chalice that is the root of all magecraft, the one that is said to grant its holder's wishes?
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Yes, that's the one.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Mages in Fuyuki City competed for the Grail, and in order to activate it summoned seven Heroic Spirits[line 3]
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That was the beginning of the Holy Grail War. Unknown[sr]to anyone, Servants were summoned to this town.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The Fuyuki Holy Grail War system is simple.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Seven Masters fight each other.[sr]The last one standing gets the Grail.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Chaldea learned about this in 2010. My father...[sr]I mean, the previous director used this data to build the summoning system.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That's what makes up Chaldea's Heroic Spirit Summoning System, Fate. Our third invention after Laplace and Chaldeas.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Third? Isn't that the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Olga Marie
That was created by Professor Lev.[sr]Well, I guess you can say we both worked on it.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Olga Marie
Anyway, this is where Servants come from.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Seven Servants fought here, and in the end, Saber was victorious.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The town wasn't destroyed, and the Servants shouldn't have been noticed by anyone, but...
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Now this is happening. We should assume that[sr]the outcome changed due to this Singularity.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The anomaly in 2004 brought about an alteration to human history and as a result, we're no longer able to see 100 years into the future.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That's why it's our job to repair this anomaly.[sr]Somewhere here is the reason history has been disturbed.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Olga Marie
Once we analyze and eliminate it, that will complete our[sr]mission. All of us will be able to return to the present.
[k]

？1：I see. Got it.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Anyway, although we're not sure what's going on, it's good that the mission is simple.
[k]

？2：Heroic Spirits were summoned at Chaldea?

[charaFace E 0]
＠Olga Marie
Of course.[sr]But it didn't go well, and there weren't many successes.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
According to the data, three were summoned, but I only know of two.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The previous director summoned the first.[sr]The second and third arrived after I became Director.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
...The second fused with Mash.[sr]And, well, you know the third.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The weirdo that now lives in Chaldea.[sr]Leonardo da Vinci.
[k]
