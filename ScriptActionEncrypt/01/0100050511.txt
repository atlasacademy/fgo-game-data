＠Dr. Roman
In Eastern and Western America, the Celts and Edison have raised armies and are at war. This we understand.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But do you know of any other Servants who we speculate were summoned as countermeasures?

Yes, there are three other... No, two other Servants that fight with me. I'll introduce you after we escape.
[k]

＠Geronimo
It seems there are many more Servants who have been summoned here to America, though.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Geronimo
...But we're short on military strength, so we had to act very carefully.
[k]

＠Geronimo
To be honest, the Celtic army is picking us off one by one.

But if you join us, we'll be able to take decisive action.

What is it, angel?[sr]...I take that back.[charaFace C 4] I was inappropriate. My apologies.

Go ahead.

＠Nightingale
If memory serves me correctly, Geronimo, you were once at war with this nation.
[k]

＠Geronimo
...That's right.
[k]

＠Nightingale
If this era is corrected, you will be treated as a warrior who failed.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Is that still all right?

I don't mind.

...Victory or defeat, in the end, it's no more than a point embedded in the flow of time.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Crushing this era would mean that my brothers and I shed all this blood for nothing.
[k]

＠Geronimo
It's simple to pretend something doesn't exist. It's even easier if that something is disadvantageous to yourself.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Even so, being able to acknowledge something is what makes us warriors. Only a sly coyote would pretend something doesn't exist.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Geronimo
Too much irony for my taste.
[k]

＠Nightingale
...I see. Then for now, I can think of you as an ally, yes?

I wouldn't want to try fooling a gaze that could even shoot a sun down. Ah, here's the exit[line 3]
