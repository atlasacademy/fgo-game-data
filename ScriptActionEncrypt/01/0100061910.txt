Hahaha. Absolutely.

＠Cursed Arm
I had prepared myself for it, but it was terrifying to go through that feeling again.
[k]

？2：Isn't the First Hassan a little too scary?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Cursed Arm
You can't be a leader if you're not scary.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
We are just the leaders of Assassins, but he is the leader of all 19 past Old Men of the Mountain.

Normally, you would need to pass a sanity check the moment you set eyes on him.

＠Mash
Yes, I believe so.
[k]

？1：Mash, what's the Atlas Institute?

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
One of the three major schools of the Mage's Association.
[k]

＠Mash
The Atlas Institute specializes in alchemy. The success that it has seen can't be duplicated.
[k]

＠Mash
Trismegistus, the Pseudo-Spiritron Calculating Engine that analyzes Chaldeas, was a donation from it.
[k]

＠Mash
And that wasn't the only one. The Atlas Institute has also provided many other technologies to Chaldea.
[k]

？2：Wasn't Trismegistus made by them?

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes, they manufactured Trismegistus. Only they could analyze and calculate Chaldeas so accurately.
[k]

＠Mash
The Atlas Institute is the brainchild of the oldest alchemists. Its goal is to “avoid a bad future.”
[k]

＠Mash
Without the institute's cooperation, Chaldea wouldn't have become an organization recognized by the Mage's Association or the United Nations.
[k]

Hmm. The Atlas Institute of that time period...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Wasn't the desert of Ozymandias before Christ?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Then it would be the Atlas Institute before the Mage's Association was formed... It feels dangerous...

...Are you against the idea of us going to the Atlas Institute, Doctor?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Why would I be? You'll learn the truth about the Lion King if you go there.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In other words, you could find out why the Round Table is taking such drastic actions.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Okay... I didn't expect that. I thought you would be opposed to that idea.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
I do think it's dangerous, but any Singularity is.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm also interested in what the Lion King's purpose is. Also, I'm curious to know how he's upsetting the Foundation of Humanity without using the Grail.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
...But it's true that I am worried.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Every mage's workshop has tons of traps against invaders.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
You saw it beneath the Mage's Association in London, didn't you?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It is said that the Atlas Institute has so many abandoned magical weapons, it can destroy the world seven times over.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
To send you guys to such a place...[sr]If Da Vinci were here, what would she say?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Definitely. If Da Vinci were alive...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]

...She is alive. Leonardo is not gone. She's a reckless genius, but she won't die so easily.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Yes. This is just my gut feeling, but...
[k]

＠Mash
I felt like First Hassan deliberately tampered with the communications from Chaldea.
[k]

＠Mash
Maybe he didn't want the Doctor to hear about the Atlas Institute... That's what it felt like to me.
[k]

＠Mash
So I couldn't help but be wary of sharing such things with him.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

But it seems like that was my misunderstanding.

Doctor Roman remains, as ever, our slightly unreliable yet good-hearted leader.
