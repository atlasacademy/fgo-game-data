Haha... Well, it can't be helped.[sr]I fought plenty, I've had my fill.

＠Fionn
Diarmuid, I'm quite satisfied.[sr]But are you still not content?
[k]

＠Diarmuid
...Yes. I thought victory would be ours this time.
[k]

＠Fionn
[line 2]Well, to be honest. I didn't care if we won or lost this time.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fionn
When I was alive, I became more and more tainted.
[k]

＠Fionn
The glimmer in my eyes wallowed within politics.[sr]The treasure, power, and duty I won tied me down more and more.
[k]

＠Fionn
It was painful.[sr]So painful, yet I couldn't let it go.
[k]

＠Fionn
[line 2]I fear that's why I envied you so much,[sr]as you were trying to die for your love.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
My king... You...

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fionn
We fought together.[sr]In a pure yet avaricious pursuit of victory.

That's not necessary.[sr]I have neither the time nor the means to heal myself.
[k]

＠Nightingale
My heart is torn to pieces by the simple existence of patients, after all.
[k]

＠Nightingale
That's why... If I was to be healed, it would be when there are no more patients in the world.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Until then, I will bear any wound as compensation.

＠Fionn
Yes, very well! It was worthwhile being summoned,[sr]if only because I was able to live youthfully until death!

＠Fionn
Farewell, defenders of order![sr]Let us meet again, if fate allows!
