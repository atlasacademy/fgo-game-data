＠Nero
I get the gist of what you're saying.[sr]That goddess isn't our enemy, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Right. I'm assuming that's the case.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Hmm, in that case, isn't it simple?[sr]Ancient Goddess Stheno, come to Rome!

I am Rome.[sr]The fifth emperor of the Roman Empire, Nero Claudius.
[k]

＠Nero
I shall accept you as a new god.[sr]Let us defeat the United Empire together!

I am not suitable for combat.

Now that I've taken on the form of a Servant, I do have some skills and basic functions, but...

I don't possess the power to fight valiantly like my younger sister.

As you walk along the coast, you'll find an[sr]entrance to a cave. All the way in the back...

[charaFace E 5]
＠Stheno
I prepared a treasure.[sr]It doesn't exist in nature, it's something special.

I'll give it to you because you're fun.[sr]Haha, I don't usually reward someone like this.
