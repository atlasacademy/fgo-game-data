...Oh, come to think of it, we ran into each other a bit[sr]in France, didn't we?

＠Atalante
I was affected by Madness Enhancement back then...[sr]But this time I've been summoned as a normal Archer.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Thank you very much.[sr]My name is Mash Kyrielight.

Mash, was it?[sr]You can stop joking.

＠Atalante
Lady Artemis is the goddess of hunting and virginity.[sr]There's no way she could be summoned as a Servant.

Hey, Darling?[sr]Atalante doesn't believe me.

I-I'm fine. The Holy Grail War on the great seas[sr]has strengthened my mind a bit...
[k]

＠Atalante
E-Even finding out the goddess I worship is[sr]hopelessly romantic won't be enough to break me!
[k]
