Trismegistus in Chaldea was based off it.

？1：That's...the original?

＠Holmes
Indeed. The one sent to Chaldea is merely a copy.

＠Holmes
It is a Photonic Crystal, a Philosopher's Stone. An out-of-place artifact that cannot be created through science in the present world.

The simple truth... We should be able to understand the results. Although it would be like looking at a mathematical equation's solution.
[k]

？1：What are you checking?

[charaFace D 3]
＠Holmes
Ah, I'm embarrassed to admit it, but it's a record that even I couldn't trace. The recording of a certain event, kept secret from all.

[charaFace D 1]

Hahahahaha! That's not what I'm doing. I'm only interested in the honest truth!

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Holmes
No, it's not the origin.[sr]But it is an important factor.
[k]

＠Holmes
The Holy Grail War. That is a grand ritual, where Heroic Spirits are summoned to fight, in which the last surviving mage and Servant standing obtain the Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
You already know that much.[sr]Right, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1]?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Very well. That ritual did indeed take place.[sr]In 2004, located in a certain city of Japan.
[k]

＠Holmes
I checked the records of this war. However, I couldn't figure out what happened during its course, or how it concluded.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Holmes
The only traceable data was from when the Holy Grail War started: the identities of the seven mages who sought the Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
Among those seven who participated, one of them was related to someone you know.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Or to be precise, the daughter of that person.
[k]

？1：...Don't tell me it's...
？2：...The previous director of Chaldea?

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
That's right. The father of Olga Marie Animusphere, the late director of Chaldea.
[k]

＠Holmes
As a Lord of the Clock Tower, he secretly headed to that regional city of Japan, and participated in that bloody ritual.
[k]

＠Holmes
His name was...
[k]

[se ad15]
＠Holmes
...Hm? An answer already? It's a little sad that it doesn't make sounds while in operation.
[k]

＠Holmes
However, I'm glad to see it backs up my hypothesis.[sr]This resolves one of the questions.
[k]

＠Holmes
The winner of the 2004 Holy Grail War in Japan was Marisbury Animusphere.
[k]

＠Holmes
Hermes recorded that he killed six other mages, and obtained the omnipotent wish granter known as the Holy Grail.

Correct. Records indicate Marisbury brought his assistant along to the Holy Grail War...
[k]

＠Holmes
...and that, having been given special exemption the following year, the assistant was then invited to join the staff of Chaldea.
[k]

＠Holmes
He became the top of the medical division in his early twenties, so “special” is the word for it. I'd hesitate to call him a normal person.
[k]

？1：...The top of the medical division...
？2：...

？！

[charaFace A 0]

[charaFace A 7]

Doctor Roman... He knew the former director before coming to Chaldea?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Yes. And it gets stranger. The personal history of the man named Romani Archaman is unknown.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Holmes
I couldn't find anything about him in records from before the Holy Grail War. I might figure it out if I keep using Hermes, but...
[k]

＠Holmes
We don't have the time to salvage data about a single person, out of the billions of personal data files updated yearly.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
But that's the reason why I don't trust Doctor Roman. There's no mistake that he's human, and not a mage, but...
[k]

He's hiding something. Something extraordinarily close to the truth.

[k]

＠Holmes
The only things recorded are results.
[k]

＠Holmes
According to Hermes, Marisbury went on to become a great mage.
[k]

＠Holmes
To the Clock Tower, Chaldea and the Animusphere family's theories were mostly disregarded.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
However, that assessment was overturned after repeated successes. The establishment of the Heroic Spirit Summoning System.
[k]

＠Holmes
Experiments that made it possible to not just observe the future, but also use Rayshifts to intervene in other time periods.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Chaldea was nothing more than an observatory in 2004, but then gained vast amounts of equipment like any other research facility.
[k]

＠Holmes
It's safe to assume that Marisbury wished for fortune.
[k]

＠Holmes
He had no reason to wish for the Incineration of Humanity. Reading the documents, he comes off as a man of good sense.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
His desire was ordinary, his envy was ordinary, and his love of happiness was ordinary... That's the type of man he was.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
In that case, he was either used by a third party, or... he stepped into a minefield of destruction, without even noticing it himself.

＠Holmes
Lev Lainur was appointed to Chaldea at the turn of the century. That coincides with the time when the technology to construct the observation lens, Sheba, was provided to Chaldea.
[k]

＠Holmes
Lev Lainur was working under the King of Mages.[sr]I have no doubt about that.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Holmes
...To be honest, this causes me the biggest headache. Chaldea caught the eye of Lev, and he infiltrated it.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
In that case, there must have been some issue at Chaldea before the Holy Grail War of 2004.
[k]

＠Holmes
That war was just a way for Marisbury to obtain capital. There's a possibility that it wasn't related to the Incineration of Humanity.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Holmes
With that in mind... I don't want to say this, but... it would mean this about Romani Archaman:
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
“We don't know what he was doing, but he had no connection to the incident. A simple nuisance, a mystery... Someone who doesn't really matter at all.”

...By being in possession of something that gathers Heroic Spirits.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
A seat where many heroes once gathered.[sr]A rite of vows called the Round Table.
[k]

＠Holmes
Chaldea processed that relic, using it as a catalyst for summons, and buried it in the body of a fused being.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
I am sure you can understand this, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1]... That while the weapon she carries looks like a shield, that's not what it actually is.
[k]

＠Holmes
That the first Servant you contracted with is actually the groundwork for gathering many Heroic Spirits.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
