＠Uruk Soldier
Yes, my king!
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
Currently, there are 306 citizens left in Uruk. Of those, 212 are soldiers, and the rest are civilians.
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
Initially, the citizens refused to evacuate, but after the king spoke to them, they agreed to evacuate to the Northern Wall.
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
Of the citizens who already escaped to the Northern Wall, there are 157 survivors. After this afternoon's Laḫmu attack, there are now 38 surviving soldiers.
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
All together, there are five hundred humans left alive in Sumer.

No. It's correct. Between the two Laḫmu attacks and the sea encroachment, the first dynasty of Uruk has fallen.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Even if we make it through this predicament, the kingdom cannot be maintained. It would only go into decline.

Tiamat sees things differently than you or I, yes. To her, humans and the land are all a single life-form.

Oh, on that point, I do have a theory...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Tiamat... Actually, I believe all of the Beasts have individual differences.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Of all of them, Tiamat's inborn nature is to never experience death. No matter what she does, death will never find her.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[%1] destroying Tiamat's brain out at sea more or less proved the theory.

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
I know this sounds absurd, but stay with me:[sr]Tiamat [communicationCharaFace 5]is the mother of all life in existence.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The very fact that we're alive proves her existence. That's why there's no way to destroy her.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's paradoxical, but as long as life continues to exist on land, Tiamat, Beast II, will never die.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
She is the beginning and the end.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The only way she could be affected by the normal laws of physics, and be harmed, is as the last thing on the world to die.

Now we're up against a wall...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
All of us at Chaldea want to agree on the strategy of luring Tiamat to Uruk and then sending her to the Underworld.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But there just isn't enough time.

...You COULD go up against Tiamat and just accept that you'd die or get swallowed up by the mud, but then we'd be even worse off...

Whining will do us no good. We have no plan, but hastiness is also the height of folly.

＠Gilgamesh
And [%1] is exhausted. Let us rest our weary bones here.

There isn't much time until dawn.

＠Gilgamesh
This will be our last chance to relax in Uruk. Everyone, replenish your energy.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
But don't stop thinking. We are not going to sleep and just give up.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
We're going to get through tonight so we can survive tomorrow.
