Let's say there was a heroic deed done amidst a mass of tragedies. A miracle that happened among many sacrifices.

Out of all the people who only worked for profit, there was one who went around and helped the suffering and asked for nothing.

Such an achievement would only be taken advantage of, and then dishonored by those who failed to live up to that standard!

We've burned away the mud from the sea, but if the black mud comes from Mother, that doesn't matter.

Let's get back to Uruk right away. We need to come up with a new plan.

No, Ishtar. We can't do that.

You should know that already. There's no point in going back now.

＠Quetzalcoatl
If we don't stop Tiamat, all the work being done in Uruk as we speak will be for nothing.

[charaFace C 2]
＠Ishtar
Then what do you propose we do!? Watch you blast away with your sun until you die!?

If we're down to you killing yourself, let's at least try MY last resort first...

That won't work either, Ishtar. ...That thing can fly.

？！

Yes, just vaporizing the mud beneath her is not enough. If she can fly, then she won't fall.

[charaFace C 2]

That can't be! Tiamat is the goddess of Ki, the Earth. She would never go near An, the heavens!
