＠Jeanne
I'm so ashamed that I said I'd fight on my own earlier.[sr]Thanks to you two, I feel stronger than ever.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne
Even if I'm up against myself, a witch, I have nothing[sr]to be afraid of now the two of you are with me.
[k]

？1：Being called a witch...

？2：Are you all right?

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
I am fine.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
Needless to say, it saddens me that they'd mistake me for that other Jeanne.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
But it can't be helped.
[k]

＠Jeanne
In fact, it hasn't been more than a few days since I was burned at the stake...
[k]

＠Jeanne
If a resurrected me caused a massacre in Orleans, then I can't blame them for being scared of me.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne
...I was afraid the British might be stirred up, but it would appear things are going smoothly.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
We should seek out the Jeanne who they call a witch and defeat her.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
But for now, we should scout around first.[sr]The goal is simple, but reaching it not so much.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As expected, Jeanne d'Arc is well-versed in the art of[sr]the war. Like she said, an assault on Orleans is ill-advised.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's an unfamiliar land and we have yet to set up any[sr]bases. For now, take the initiative and gather intel on their defenses.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As for the witch Jeanne[line 2]Or shall we call her Dark Jeanne? I would like to find out what kind of Servant she is.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The rest is up to our forces.[sr]It would be good to have more allies.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Jeanne, is there a reading on any other Servants besides ourselves?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
I'm sorry, but as I am now, I am incapable of using my ability as a Ruler to detect other Servants.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Like other ordinary Servants, I cannot detect them unless I am within a certain distance.
[k]

？1：Wait, what about the other Jeanne?

？2：Rulers can detect Servants?

？！

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jeanne
I was careless.[sr]There is that possibility.
[k]

＠Jeanne
The other me... No, Witch Jeanne... Urgh, it's[sr]too confusing, I will also refer to her as Dark Jeanne!
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
Anyway, if that Dark Jeanne is truly a Servant then her Class, like mine, is Ruler.
[k]

＠Jeanne
If that is the case, she will immediately be able to detect[sr]our location. We must be prepared for battle at all times.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
If possible, I would like to minimize our activities in any nearby towns and villages[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
But without any lead on our hands, I doubt that's possible.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Let us head out early tomorrow morning.[sr][%1] is human and should probably get some sleep...
[k]

？1：I'll do that then.

？2：Are you all right?

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne
Yes, I am fine.
[k]

＠Jeanne
My abilities may have gone down in rank, but I still possess the basic abilities of a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Well, good night.

＠Jeanne
Did [%1] go to sleep?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes, surprisingly quick for someone who is unfamiliar with sleeping outdoors.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Is that so...
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...I could be imagining things, but is there something you aren't telling us?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
...
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
I don't mean to pry...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I thought it best to confront you in case it should become an obstacle in battle.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne
Quite right.[sr]As you wish, I shall tell you.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
It could be because my summoning was incomplete.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Or[line 2]perhaps it's because my original self died just a few days ago.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
How can I put it?[sr]It feels as if I am a "brand-new Servant."
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
A rookie, you mean?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Yes. There is no future or past in the Throne of Heroes.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
But, I don't have the power to access the records there.[sr]Therefore, it is difficult for me to act as a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
It feels like going into battle for the first time all over again. And that bubbly-looking mage from before...
[k]

＠Jeanne
He called me a saint and savior, but even with that expectation, I have no such power.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
...So, the thing is.[sr]I fear that I will become a burden to you.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Jeanne, if that's all then it's all right.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
What?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
I mean, this also feels like my first battle.[sr]We are the same.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
As a Demi-Servant, I cannot fully harness my power as a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
However, the Heroic Spirit inside of me said "It's okay."
[k]

＠Mash
And Senpai[line 3]Master, trusts someone like me.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...I don't know how to say this, but Senpai didn't choose to fight to prove something.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Senpai is simply trying to do what should be done, I think.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
So, it's all right.[sr]There's no reason for you to worry.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
...Thank you. I feel a little better.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne
I am pretty familiar with this era and this country.[sr]Let's give it our best tomorrow!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Yes!
