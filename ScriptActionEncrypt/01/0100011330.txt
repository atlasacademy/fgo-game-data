＠Elisabeth
Why, you! Why you, why you, why you!
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Carmilla
This is...quite irritating. This "me."
[k]

＠Elisabeth
Right back at you![sr]How did you get to be a Servant?
[k]

＠Carmilla
Never thought you'd say that. From where I sit,[sr]it's far more maddening to see that I've become a Servant as myself!
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Carmilla
I'm a revered countess, feared by all.[sr]The finished product.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Carmilla
I'm not like an unfinished product like you.[sr]I devoured fear and became an Anti-Hero.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Carmilla
But what about you?
[k]

＠Carmilla
You devoured the existence that is me. You simply[sr]refused to age, and feared being sealed away.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Carmilla
Of course you did.[sr]From your perspective, I'm just a sign of your sin.
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠Carmilla
The guilt you brought upon yourself, the unassailable record of your murders!
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Elisabeth
...That's right.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Elisabeth
You are who I really am, my final destination.[sr]The symbol of my sin, that no tears will ever change.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
Denying you means looking away from the crimes I've committed.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Elisabeth
But that doesn't mean I can't take responsibility![sr]It may be ugly self-deception, but I'll say it anyway!
[k]

＠Elisabeth
I... I don't want to be like you!
[k]

＠Carmilla
How foolish, we're spirits of the past.[sr]The future's already been decided.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
I know that![sr]But I'm saying it anyway!
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Elisabeth
Help me, Little Puppy!
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Elisabeth
You may be a step down from the Master I dream of, but you're still first rate!
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Elisabeth
Please let me settle things with her![sr]Let me sing with everything I have!
