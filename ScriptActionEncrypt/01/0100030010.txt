What was that pillar of flesh? Who was that,[sr]claiming to be one of the 72 Demon Gods?

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Also, please refrain from spreading rumors.[sr]None of this information is substantiated.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
To begin with, the 72 Demon Gods are all fantasies.[sr]Demon Gods don't actually exist.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
These days people speculate that they were merely familiars broken down into 72 different roles, right?
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Da Vinci
Yeah. But since the roles were so clearly defined,[sr]some theorize that they may be the origin of angels.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And since he actually claimed to be one, it's not unrelated?
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Da Vinci
How about the hypothesis that Lev, or the mastermind behind him, summoned "a certain ancient king?"
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
...That possibility does exist...[sr]Still, I find the idea of 72 Demon Gods hard to believe...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Da Vinci
Why is that?[sr]I mean, [%1] actually fought one, right?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
That's why. The data I have seems to[sr]correspond with what I would expect from a "demon."
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
But, uh, how do I put this... It follows the legend too well.[sr]The concept of demons came much later than that king.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Suppose that king really did turn into a Heroic Spirit.[sr]His Noble Phantasm would be a lot simpler and smarter.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It would be strange to have such an ominous Demon God, one that modern-day people know of, serving under him.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Da Vinci
Hmm. You have a point.[sr]The chance that they're just assuming the name is high.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Now, if we could just ask Servants related to Demon Gods a few questions, it would make our lives infinitely easier.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

Yeah. That's why, for now, I won't comment on the Demon God Lev transformed into. It's still anybody's guess.

Ocean, you say?

[charaFace B 5]

Right. The geography is shifting[sr]correspondingly with the Singularity.

＠Dr. Roman
It doesn't look like there's an area[sr]that can be specifically marked "here."

The sea only has several islands scattered around.[sr]I would like you to investigate the cause of the Singularity immediately.
