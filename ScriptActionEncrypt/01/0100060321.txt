？2：You did well, Mash!

＠Nitocris
(...I'm surprised she managed, with such a weak body... Upon closer inspection, her hands and legs are still trembling...)

＠Da Vinci
Still, this means we're safe now. The other sphinxes around us won't attack.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
As she said, we should cut through the storm. It's finally time to confront the truth[line 3]

＠Da Vinci
