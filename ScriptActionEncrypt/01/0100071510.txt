＠Siduri
Currently all remaining forces have gathered at Uruk's Northern Wall to prepare for the imminent invasion of Gorgon's main army.
[k]

＠Siduri
The Demonic Beasts have gathered in the Cedar Forest. They number roughly 100,000. That's over ten times the size of our force.
[k]

＠Siduri
The Northern Wall has been fortified repeatedly, but once they invade, it won't last more than half a day.
[k]

＠Siduri
On top of that, if Gorgon herself appears, the Northern Wall will almost certainly collapse under her attack.
[k]

＠Siduri
With no wall, the soldiers will find it hard to retreat, and will likely be swallowed up by the waves of Demonic Beasts.

[charaFace H 5]
＠Gilgamesh
In the face of such a massive attack, we won't be able to defend. That means the only thing we can do is attack their base.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
We of Uruk will buy you some time[line 2]half a day[line 2]at the Northern Wall. While we do that, you head to Gorgon's base: the Blood Temple, also called Blood Fort.

[k]

＠Ishtar
First of all, how are you going to destroy the Blood Fort? Humans can't even get through its entrance, you know?
[k]

＠Ishtar
I flew around that area a few times to check things out. That thing is more like a fortified mountain than a temple.
[k]

＠Ishtar
And in that “mountain” is a cave where she's made her nest. It's like she's an ant.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Protecting the entrance to that cave is a Bounded Field. So, normally, you'd need to organize some sort of siege, right?

This morning, a mysterious Servant calling themselves the Jaguar Parcel Service delivered the axe to us.
[k]

＠Siduri
Per the king's orders, we sent it directly to the Northern Wall. The Servant left a message for Lady Quetzalcoatl, too:
