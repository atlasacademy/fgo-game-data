＠Nightingale
I would hesitate to call it infinite.
[k]

＠Nightingale
It may be infinite given enough time, but we're defeating them faster than they're being created.
[k]

＠Nightingale
You could say that we're cornering her, both in Magecraft and science.

Let's go, everyone...[sr]Although we may not make it in time.

？1：Make it in time?
？2：For what?
？！

＠Nightingale
...I don't know, but it seems like they're hiding a secret weapon.

[charaFace D 7]
＠Nightingale
Her smile wasn't because this is too easy for her,[sr]nor was it an attempt to mock us.
[k]

＠Nightingale
That was the smile of a predator.
[k]

＠Nightingale
It was an unbearably sadistic smile, made right when she destroys something dear to us.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Nightingale
But it's not towards us. If it was, she would have used the trump card immediately.

Yes, I understand what you're trying to say, Nightingale. However, we must still pursue her.

Now, we head to the White House!
