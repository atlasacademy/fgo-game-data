[charaFace H 5]

What was it that called me, lightning itself?[sr]What was it that called me, the genius?

A cry? A wish? Good? Evil?

I see[line 3][sr]It was all of them that brought me here.

Fascinating.[sr]All the scholars together called me?

Hahaha[line 3]

＠Nikola Tesla
Hahahahahahahaha![sr]Fascinating! You have brought me laughter, scholars!

＠Nikola Tesla
I am a genius, but also a super-human who loved the[sr]bizarre! Very well then!

＠Nikola Tesla
I shall grant your wish![sr]I, the genius and the lightning, shall head to the surface!

[line 2]So, yeah.

While the explosive magical energy from the summoning was blowing you away or almost burying you under rubble,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Heroic Spirit Nikola Tesla started heading for the[sr]surface. This was just a few minutes ago.

Nikola Tesla.[sr]He's known for being a scientist and inventor, isn't he?
[k]

＠Mash
If you define the modern era as an electricity-based[sr]machine civilization, then you can say he created its "foundation."

＠Dr. Roman
Yup. Looks like there's similar cases in the past. Where[sr]one of them is a human, the other's a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But the human Nikola Tesla has nothing to do with that.[sr]We just have to stop his materialization as a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The powerful lightning that he automatically brings to his[sr]surroundings will instantly activate the Demonic Fog.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
If he gets to a place where the fog is especially dense,[sr]what's happening in London will spread explosively.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Then it won't just be in London.[sr]It'll cover all of Britain.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
If that happens,[sr]we'll be unable to restore Humanity in this Singularity.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Foundation of Humanity will be completely[sr]destroyed, and human history will end in this era.

＠Dr. Roman
Normally a Heroic Spirit that appears from the fog[sr]doesn't automatically become our enemy, but...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
In his case, Makiri's incantation[sr]has had a small effect similar to Madness Enhancement.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He's not a pure Berserker.[sr]But his mind and actions are limited.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
When I spoke to him via the comms,[sr]he did respond[line 3]
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But there was a sense that his actions were controlled.[sr]If we don't stop him he'll automatically go for the Fog.
[k]

？1：Let's stop him!

？2：Let's chase him.
