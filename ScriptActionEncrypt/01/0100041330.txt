Hmm? Somebody's here. A man and a woman.[sr]They're not dead, so are they Servants?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Looks like they're Servants that appeared from the fog.[sr]I see two of them. They don't look like enemies.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
But you did wonderfully. You truly are one of Raikou's[sr]Four Kings, whose might shakes the heavens.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Sakata Kintoki
You too. Thanks for the help![sr]Whew...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...But you just looked away, didn't you?[sr]You did. Why? Is your worship a lie?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Eh, I did not.[sr]Sure you're not imagining it?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
(Those boobs! I can see your boobs, Fox![sr]I don't know where am I supposed to look, get it!?)

＠Mordred
Now we just have to catch up and slay him. Okay,[sr]let's follow him, Mash, [%1]!
[k]

？1：Are we going up those stairs?

＠Mash
Yes, they're made with a type of magecraft...[sr]It seems, anyway. We can walk on them.
[k]

＠Mordred
It's scary to think about them disappearing halfway up.[sr]But we'll deal with that if it happens.
[k]

？2：Looks like there's no time to rest.

＠Mordred
Yeah, we're gonna run up those stairs![sr]Even if they might disappear partway!
[k]

＠Mash
That's probably a magical staircase created by[sr]Nikola Tesla. Who knows how long it will last...
[k]

＠Mordred
I'll take care of that if it happens.[sr]There's no time to waste, just like you said.
[k]

？！

Yes, Senpai. The Activated Fog is gone.[sr]That golden Servant was right!

So you're here[line 3][sr]So you truly will try to build a new legend?

But sadly, that's impossible. Even without[sr]Activated Fog, my lightning is far too strong.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Nikola Tesla
Why? Because I am a genius.[sr]Why? Because I am the lightning.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
What is a god[line 3][sr]Yes, what is a god? A god is the lightning.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
Since ancient times, many men have believed this,[sr]and in fact...
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
Even setting Zeus and Indra aside, it is indeed a god.[sr]Lightning, a divine power striking from the heavens.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Nikola Tesla
Behold. The light I bring to the earth[sr]is great power itself!
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
Energy guiding a new electric, consumer civilization! My[sr]lightning is the final farewell to the old era and its myths!
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
It is a new myth![sr]It is "my light," a gift unto humanity!
