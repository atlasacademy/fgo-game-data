They'll be here soon, my king.[sr]How's your body?

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
The restoration is complete. It'd be a bit troublesome if Arjuna[charaFace A 4] betrayed us, though[line 2]

If the need arises, we could always use “that.”

＠Medb
They'll struggle, and writhe, and try to stand up.[sr]All those who glare at us with determination in their eyes.

＠Medb
We'll crush them under our heels easily.[sr][line 2]Ahh, [charaFace B 3]I'm so excited!
