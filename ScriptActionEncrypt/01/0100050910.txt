It's a shame that a Western is the only thing you can shoot in a town like this[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠G：???
But not to worry. Even in a Western, my extraordinary acting talent will no doubt win me an Academy Award!
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠G：???
I'll be concurrently responsible for production, direction, the script, music, and the leading role...

[charaFace G 2]

Oh, no![sr]I just realized there's no cameraman[line 2]!

[charaFace G 0]
＠G：???
Hmph, what am I to do... Perhaps the time has finally come for me to try my hand at summoning?
[k]

＠G：???
But my profound talent may result in summoning a big shot... I'll be forced to choose between Eastwood and Scott...
[k]

＠E：???
Hmm. Hollywood, is it? One must not underestimate the creative minds of Servants.

Do excuse me. My name is Fergus. I once earned my keep as a Knight of the Red Branch.

Normally, I would have happily called myself a cameraman in order to hit on you[line 2]but things are complicated now.

So I'm going to kill you. Period.[sr]If you want someone to resent, you have only me.
[k]

＠Fergus
I'm doing this entirely for myself, after all. I'll cut you down just because I want to.
[k]

＠G：???
Hmph. You seem to have your reasons, but I won't ask. You're quite bold to think you can kill me.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠G：???
I don't mean to boast, but I, Nero Claudius, am not a petty Servant who will die so easily, you see?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Fergus
...Nero, the tyrant of ancient Rome![sr]What an unusual Servant to run into.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

No wonder your radiance is different from that mediocre rabble. Such a swelling. A swelling similar to a waterfall.

＠Nero Bride
Mediocre...rabble?
[k]

＠Fergus
Indeed. On my way here,[sr]I cut down three other Servants.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Fergus
So you'll be my fourth victim.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Nero Bride
Oh. Very impressive.
[k]

＠Nero Bride
But unfortunately, O mighty Fergus mac Róich, you're quite mistaken.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Nero Bride
The fourth victim...will be YOU!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Fergus
[line 2]I see. So I guess you aren't just an emperor that orders people about from your throne.
[k]

＠Fergus
How delightful. I guess there was no need to bring them...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Fergus
Very well then. I'm Fergus, of the Saber class. I'll face you as one of the queen's knights.
[k]

＠Nero Bride
You know, what you're most mistaken about is your destiny. You are truly unlucky.
