Heh[line 3]that was quite heated for mere amusement. Thanks to that, my head feels better.

＠Nitocris
Pharaoh, what exactly... No, um, do you intend to punish these people?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Ozymandias
Naturally. Their objective is the Holy Grail.[sr]The Grail now belongs to me.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
That means they will eventually try to kill me. I have no intention of letting them live.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Nitocris
Wha... Are you saying that I personally brought your enemies before you, Pharaoh?
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Ozymandias
Indeed I am. However[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Ozymandias
Nitocris. I hadn't told you about the Holy Grail, nor have I shared with you any knowledge relating to this Singularity.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
That was my own blunder. This is not your crime.[sr]That is all because[line 3]

...Hmph. I honestly thought they had perished around the Fourth Singularity. So much for my speculation.
[k]

[charaFace F 9]
＠Ozymandias
Good grief[line 3] You're far too slow! Slow, slow, slow! There's a limit to how slow one should be!
[k]

＠Ozymandias
O Master of Chaldea!
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Humanity in this era collapsed long before you arrived!

King Ozymandias...[sr]What exactly does that mean...

[charaFadein F 0.1 1]
＠Ozymandias
Exactly as I said it. In this era[line 3] there should have been a war to claim the Holy Land.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
One side defending, and one side invading. A merciless slaughter between two absolutely incompatible nations.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
At the end, one side would have claimed the Holy Grail, and the Holy Land would have become a seedbed for a Demon God Pillar.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
[line 3]That is, if you had arrived in this land just a little earlier.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But that didn't happen... So that means the war to capture the Holy Land never occurred, correct?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
After all, the Grail is in your possession, King Ozymandias. You were likely summoned by someone on the Crusaders' side.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And then you naturally opposed them, taking the Holy Land as your own.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Is this territory of Egypt something you summoned? And is that what caused the collapse of humanity in this era?

＠Ozymandias
...Who are you?[sr]You seem to be quite knowledgeable...
[k]

？1：She's Leonardo da Vinci.

[charaFace F 1]
＠Ozymandias
Oh? I know that name. One of the greatest geniuses in human history.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Ozymandias
Yes, yes indeed. It is said that there is a fine line between genius and insanity!
[k]

？2：She's Da Vinci-chan.

[charaFace F 5]
＠Ozymandias
Da Vinci-chan? I don't know of a Heroic Spirit by that name...
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Ozymandias
However, I can tell by your beauty.[sr]With true beauty comes true knowledge, after all.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Listen, Da Vinci-chan or whatever your name is. I intend to take you as my concubine one day. Plan accordingly.
[k]

？！

＠Da Vinci
No, no, no. My intelligence is only a tiiiiiny bit higher than yours, O great Sun King.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So? Was my theory correct? Can we assume that you're the Singularity in this era?

Heh[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Ozymandias
Heh heh, hahahahahaha![sr]I'm sorry to say you're mistaken, foreign sage!
[k]

[charaFace F 9]
＠Ozymandias
Did you think that I, the all-powerful Sun King, would use a poisoned chalice such as the Holy Grail!?
[k]

＠Ozymandias
I am simply the holder and protector of the Holy Grail! I have no interest whatsoever in the Holy Land!
[k]

[charaFace F 8]
＠Ozymandias
Therefore, listen carefully.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
The one who turned this era into a unique Singularity, and utterly destroyed all of humanity[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Ozymandias
He sits on the throne in what was once Jerusalem, that sacred city devoid of all hope. ...Which is where you're heading.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
They call him the Lion King... The infamous pure-white Lion King!
