Ereshkigal. You are the patron deity of Kutha, and yet joined the Three Goddess Alliance.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Of all your sins, none is greater. None even comes close.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Though I may be dead for the time being, I can still convict you under my royal authority.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Invaders are meant to be defeated by force, but the world itself judges traitors to their own.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
That is how royal authority works. You should be fully aware of that.

...Yes. If it is a king who has gained Dingir, he can punish even a god by exchanging everything he has to do so.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
That is the rule of our world. So what? Are you going to kill me in exchange for your life?

Neither my role nor my obligations have changed one bit! I am Ereshkigal, the one entrusted with the underworld!

I exist to manage all humans... all souls within the underworld. That is my destiny!

I have no regret or remorse for dedicating all I have to that task!

[k]

＠Ereshkigal
I have managed the souls of the dead here for a numbingly long time. Entertainment, joy, sadness, friends to call my own...
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
I didn't have any of those, while I watched my other half fly freely through the heavens.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
You accuse ME of a crime? After all this, you point your finger and say collecting souls is wrong?
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Is nobody going to commend me for all the work I've done...a job I did all this time all by myself?

You don't understand, fool? That one isn't foolish enough to compliment what should be normal.

It's fine to lament the obligations given to you. It's also fine to abandon them and pursue an alternate path.

However, bemoaning the obligations that you chose to uphold dutifully is evil,
