＠Leonidas
Hahaha. No need to address me as king. I am a mere soldier now. Nothing more than a shield to protect Uruk.
[k]

＠Leonidas
And today I shall be a drill sergeant from hell in the eastern barracks!
[k]

＠Leonidas
This may be a touch juvenile for someone like myself, but I am going to take great pleasure in introducing the soldiers to the hell that is Spartan training!
[k]

？1：Won't they die?

＠Leonidas
Hahaha. If a soldier dies from strenuous training, that only proves they lack spirit.
[k]

＠Leonidas
And if the training is too much and they keel over? All I must do is smack some of that spirit back into their bodies, and they'll perk right up!

？2：So the northern front is fine?

＠Leonidas
Yes. The flooding strategy at the Tigris River was successful. The Demonic Beast invasion should be weakened for a few days.
[k]

＠Leonidas
In the meantime, we must ready our army. The armory has done an excellent job of replenishing our weapons,
[k]

＠Leonidas
but the quality of the soldiers is disheartening.[sr]A matter I shall handle directly!
[k]

＠Leonidas
To make them more combat-effective, I will beat the fundaments of soldiering into them!

Today's request is actually from Leonidas.

＠Siduri
He mentioned that his trainees are coming along well, so he wants you to have a mock battle with 100 of them or so.

Indeed! Sparring with a hundred people sounds stupendous! I engaged in many such trials before my coming-of-age ceremony!

＠Leonidas
But why such a hard task, you ask?

Lord [%1], I assume you have a Spartan acquaintance?
