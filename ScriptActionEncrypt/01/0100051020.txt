＠Da Vinci
Yes, nice work as always. I'm glad you managed to establish the base safely.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
Now then. I suppose today's story should be about the United States of America?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Although... I don't have much relation to that nation at all...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Da Vinci
Besides, what kind of fool would put a code in their own self-portrait?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Do you know how it feels to have something like that pushed onto you? Do you?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
Anyway, setting that aside...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The phrase “e pluribus unum” is their national motto, meaning “out of many, one.”
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Da Vinci
But that is the contradiction.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
To unite many into a single entity,[sr]the many must lose their individuality.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They claim to be rationalism incarnate,[sr]yet act as champions of justice.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They strive to be the strongest in the world, yet believe in a god.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The nation of America is the embodiment of contradictory tendencies in humans.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
[line 2]And for that reason, their nation has no connection whatsoever to monsters or Magecraft.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
While they may all reach for the same unattainable stars, their approaches are fundamentally different.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Da Vinci
But having no connection doesn't mean one has no knowledge.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
A Holy Grail War may have occurred, even in this nation. But that would be in a different world, a faraway[sr]world[line 2]
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Da Vinci
...That's about it for today's lesson, I think.[sr]The summoning circle is established, after all.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Anyway, ciao everyone♪[sr]Do your best as always!

The necrosis in your heart is starting to spread faster. I can still keep you alive for a few days, but[line 2]

＠Nightingale
After that, I can't make any promises.
[k]

＠Rama
I understand.[sr]Just let me rest for now.
[k]

＠Nightingale
I'll inject a double dose of painkillers. That should help.
[k]

＠Rama
No, I won't stay conscious without the pain.[sr]I need to be able to move, if the time comes...
[k]

＠Nightingale
Then I'll give you the normal dose.[sr]Just be prepared for intense pain.
[k]

＠Rama
I know. This is a punishment that I must accept.
[k]

＠Nightingale
...Punishment?
[k]

＠Rama
I suffered an unsightly defeat to Cú Chulainn.[sr]Not only that, but to save me[line 2]
[k]

＠Rama
Many people were sacrificed.[sr]Therefore, this is my punishment.
[k]

＠Nightingale
...Are idiots allowed to become kings in India?
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Rama
What?
[k]

[charaFace D 7]
＠Nightingale
In what world would people, after risking their lives to save someone, be happy to see that person suffer?
[k]

＠Nightingale
The people who saved you surely wished for your safety, and for your good health.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Rama
Uh...
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Nightingale
All too foolish. Recover from your wounds, and fight to honor those who saved you.
[k]

＠Nightingale
That is the best, and only, thing you can do for them.

Yes, a primal landscape. A place where it's hard for people to survive, where only beasts are allowed to live.

How long do you need to devote to something for a nation to be born here[line 2]I can't even begin to imagine.

Countless people, resources, blood and sweat. The culmination of humanity's efforts that transcends good and evil.
