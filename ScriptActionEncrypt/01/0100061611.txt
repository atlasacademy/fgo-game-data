Ha, it took longer than I thought.[sr]I suspect the feast must be over by now.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
[%1], Lady Mash.[sr]You should rest here tonight.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
...Because tomorrow morning we will be discussing our next move. See you then.

＠Mash
...It seems like Cursed Arm is going to rest for the night. The square is still a mess, but we can't do much about it.
[k]

＠Mash
That was an amazing sight earlier.[sr]A shower of rice from Touta's bags...
[k]

＠Mash
Sanzang and Touta then used that rice and made a lot of stir-fried dishes.
[k]

＠Mash
An endless supply of rice... Enough for every single villager to eat and then some!
[k]

＠Mash
Did you know? I understand that's Touta's Noble Phantasm.
[k]

？1：That's surprising.
？2：Although he can't fight with it.

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...Right.
[k]

＠Mash
A Servant's Special Arts. An EX-ranked Noble Phantasm, yet it serves no purpose in battle.
[k]

＠Mash
A cure for people's hunger achieved without conflict.[sr]I never knew such a Noble Phantasm existed.
[k]

＠Mash
It's just amazing.
[k]

＠Mash
It reminds me of something Nero said, something like, “How can there be a nation without laughter?”
[k]

＠Mash
Those were her words to you during her fight with Romulus.
[k]

？1：That's right.
？2：Mash, you were listening?

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes. I was there at the time.[sr]I just couldn't come out.
[k]

＠Mash
The faces of the villagers earlier today...[sr]They were all smiling. Everyone was happy.
[k]

＠Mash
So that's the kind of Noble Phantasm his rice bag is...[sr]I never would've imagined it.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Of course, defeating an enemy of the innocent...[sr]is the same as saving the innocent...
[k]

＠Mash
But...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
No, never mind. I can't put it into words.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
But I do understand. I understand that every event in a Singularity is, by nature, a distortion that never should have been.
[k]

＠Mash
Everything gets corrected upon retrieving the Holy Grail: phenomena, memories, everything.
[k]

＠Mash
For Chaldea, for Senpai, restoring the Foundation of Humanity is the only action that means anything.
[k]

＠Mash
Forging friendships with those who suffer in a Singularity is therefore meaningless.
[k]

＠Mash
I know that, but... somehow...
[k]

？1：It's not meaningless.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...I, I suppose you're right.
[k]

＠Mash
Episodes, interactions, emotions... The joy, the sorrow... It's all real, regardless of whether it ends up being erased or not.
[k]

？2：Its meaning will remain, even if it gets erased.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Even if there are no records of our actions... the meaning will remain?
[k]

＠Mash
Do I have it backwards?
[k]

＠Mash
...Even if no one remembers it, even if it doesn't exist in Chaldea's records,
[k]

＠Mash
the fact that such a life definitely existed is, in itself, an essential element of human history...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...Hmm. It might be a little too difficult for me to understand, but...
[k]

＠Mash
But what a beautiful expression. “Its meaning will remain, even if it gets erased.”
[k]

＠Mash
...Even if nobody remembers anymore, the feelings that existed at that time are what make up this exact moment.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
...My apologies. I've rambled on. Like Hassan said, we're going to be busy in the morning.
[k]

＠Mash
Good night, Master. I hope you rest up, and wake up feeling good tomorrow as you always do.

All the surviving soldiers are working around the clock so we may hold a funeral for our lost comrades.

Then the only way to track them down is with my bow. It should not pose a problem if the tracks are only a day old.

This kind of job is normally for the Raider Knights, but I am sure this is also the will of His Majesty the Lion King.

＠Tristan
Even if they are just insects, I cannot stand them still roaming around.

[charaFace F 1]

Ah, how sad. It seems I will have to... pluck them from the soil with these fingers once again.
