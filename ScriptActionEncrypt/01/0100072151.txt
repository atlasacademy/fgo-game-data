Beast II is still standing! Dammit. Her Spirit Origin's durability is astounding!

Your attacks are still effective, though! Almost, you're almost there!

Ugh, trying to swallow me whole!? Rude! I'm not Marduk, there's no way I'd survive that!

What, is Merlin out!? You can't neutralize the Chaos Tide without him!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Damn! She went to target the support first! We won't be able to fight for long without him!

＠Dr. Roman
Keep your distance! If you two get consumed by the Chaos Tide, that'll be the end of everything!

In that case, I'll be a shield for Master!

Getting swallowed by the mud would change Senpai into a different creature, but I won't let that happen!

As a Demi-Servant, I should be able to withstand it for a while!

Doctor! If Master is determined to stay, I stay, too!
