Whew. I finally caught up to you. Lord Ushiwakamaru, please stop jumping off the walls.

＠Benkei
If you dive into a horde of Demonic Beasts on your own, even you may find yourself in a bit of trouble.

？1：Hello, everyone.
[charaFace E 1]

Oh, Lord [%1].[sr]Glad to see you arrived safely.

Mash, Merlin, and Ana are all here too. Yes, with this group, tomorrow's operation should go off without a hitch!

[charaFace F 1]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Yes, finally. I've been looking forward to this.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
It's our first co-op mission with the strangers from beyond our time who live at the embassy. Naturally, I am excited.

Yes. King Gilgamesh owns many weapons of great power.
[k]

＠Leonidas
This is a large ballista that allows us to manually launch them. There's a lapis lazuli embedded in the base.
[k]

＠Leonidas
When the soldiers shatter it with a hammer, the stored magical energy is released, and fires the treasure at the target.

An Uruk-style[line 2]or maybe I should say a King Gilgamesh-style[line 2]ballista.

The normal King of Heroes would never allow his soldiers to use his treasures as disposables.

＠Ushiwakamaru
That's right. They're very valuable, so he'd only use them against powerful masses of foes.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
It can't be aimed very accurately, so it's mostly used to scare the enemy. We're lucky if it hits anything.

＠Merlin
Dingir means “deified.” In Sumer, anything can be elevated to godhood by great deeds.
[k]

＠Merlin
A god recognized not by other gods, but by man. In other words, a faith by humanity, for humanity.
[k]

＠Merlin
The king naming these tools Dingirs shows his intention to have Uruk protected only by humans.

It's true that it's wrong to beg the gods for help when you're in danger. The only god who will answer to that plea is the god of death.

But last night the movements of the Demonic Beast horde changed. They're now patrolling the outskirts of Nippur.

A new commander has most likely appeared to replace Girtablilu.

Girtablilu... The Demonic Beast commander who was defeated before we arrived, right?

We should assume so.
[k]

＠Leonidas
That makes opening the Nippur gate dangerous on its own. But the people of Nippur are already starting to starve.
[k]

＠Leonidas
We can't delay the rescue mission any longer. So we're going with a diversionary tactic.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Lord Ushiwakamaru and Lord Benkei's unit will head towards Nippur from the east.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Naturally, the Demonic Beasts will attack them.
[k]

＠Leonidas
When they do, Lord [%1], Lady Mash, Lord Merlin, and Lady Ana will enter Nippur from the west.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Open the gate and then lead the survivors to our Northern Wall.
