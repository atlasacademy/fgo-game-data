Sigh... Please keep an eye on your surroundings.

＠Olga Marie
Even if Romani is monitoring us, this is a Singularity.[sr]There's no telling what might happen.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Come here, Kyrielight.[sr]You're hurt, aren't you? I can heal something like that.

＠Dr. Roman
Really, now.[sr]When the director is calm, she can be dependable...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
[%1], you should know...[sr]The director is in a complicated position as well.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Initially, Marie was like you all, a Master candidate.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Three years ago, the previous director, her father, passed away and she had to take over Chaldea when she was just a student.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Since then it's been one tense day after another.[sr]She had to take over as head of the Animusphere family.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
It was all she could do to keep Chaldea running.[sr]Around that time, an anomaly was found in Chaldeas.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We could no longer see into the promised future of 100[sr]years from now. There was huge criticism from the Association and our sponsors.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
She was ordered to get the situation back to normal as soon as possible.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
To make matters worse, they found that she had no aptitude to be a Master.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
The noble Animusphere family, one of the Twelve Lords, the dominating faculty of Astronomy at the Mage's Association.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Oh the scandal that would occur if the head of such a family was found to be unfit to become a Master.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You can imagine the level of gossip happening behind[sr]the scenes. I'm sure those rumors reached Marie too.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
She still worked to be her absolute best as Director.[sr]This last half-year, she's just barely been hanging on.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
She's worked herself so hard, I'd like her to come for counseling, but with how things are...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
In any event, she's been emotionally stretched to the[sr]limit. She doesn't hate you, or anything like that.
[k]

？1：I know. Director Marie isn't an evil person.

＠Dr. Roman
I'm glad you think so.[sr]But you know she is evil, right?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
She isn't cruel, nefarious, and dishonest, that I can[sr]promise you. She's just a rather serious person.
[k]

？2：I was just having fun.

[communicationCharaFace 2]
＠Dr. Roman
Hey, that's not nice! But I understand how you feel.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
The Director wasn't allowed to go out much growing up, so everything she says is honest and innocent...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But make sure you don't say that in front of her.[sr]She'll just hate you more.
[k]

？！

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Anyhow, you're the only three I can trust right now.[sr]I want you to continue investigating without fighting.
