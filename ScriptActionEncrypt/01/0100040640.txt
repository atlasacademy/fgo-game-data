＠Shakespeare
Well then[line 3]who is it that doth summon me!? I, Caster[sr]Shakespeare, travelled with great haste to the city of fog.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Shakespeare
Or so I wish to say to you. But it seems that I was not[sr]summoned to participate in a Holy Grail War this time.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
This is quite vexing indeed. O God! Where dost lie the[sr]grand story that I am destined to behold?
[k]

＠Shakespeare
No reply. Silence. God hast forsaken me. Where art the[sr]tale making blood boil, flesh dance, heart shiver, and soul shake!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Shakespeare
Then, I can only utter these words.[sr]Oh, "Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind!"

Do you know him?[sr]This, uh... Caster Shakespeare guy?
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Never heard of him. He's a blank.
[k]

＠Mordred
But we just confirmed our theory.[sr]Right now, this guy materialized from the Demonic Fog.

It is a tragedy that my Master does not exist. But, I was able to meet you. Surely this too is destiny.

I shall weave a tale of your exploits.[sr]I pray that your tale shall live up to your reputation.

[k]

＠Mordred
This guy[line 3]doesn't look like an enemy.[sr]It's kind of odd if you think about it.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
What's the difference between him and the likes of Jack[sr]or that clown? Jack aside, everyone moved on their own will.
[k]

＠Mordred
Also[line 3]

[charaFace E 5]

Never mind. Wait.[sr]What, did this night patrol hit the jackpot?

？！

[charaFace F 4]
＠"P"
How unfortunate. It seems you have already procured[sr]the Servant that newly materialized.
[k]

＠"P"
He appears to be a Caster. If only we had[sr]procured him, he would have made a fine ally.

Hah hah. I get it.[sr]It's really quite simple when you reveal the trick.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...Yes. Now I understand as well.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So, you procure and round up Servants materializing[sr]from the Demonic Fog, and make them your allies.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I see. Logically it's simple.[sr]But, easier said than done.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Unless you have the Holy Grail, it's impossible[sr]to make Heroic Spirits move according to your will.

[line 3]Correct. I confess as much.[sr]It is as you say.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠"P"
We continue to wait in London for those who[sr]are indispensable to us to manifest themselves.
[k]

＠"P"
So, we procure Heroic Spirits materializing from the fog[sr]one by one, and "adjust" them so they work on expanding the fog.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠"P"
It is truly regrettable indeed[sr]that we were not able to procure all of you.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠"P"
We surely would have been fine friends.[sr]All of us.
[k]

？1：I doubt it.

[line 3]As you wish. There is no catalyst to transport at[sr]this time. I shall procure you here myself.

I am Paracelsus von Hohenheim. I manipulate[sr]the Four Great Elementals, and I seek the True Ether.
