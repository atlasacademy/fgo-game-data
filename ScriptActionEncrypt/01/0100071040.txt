＠Ishtar
And so, even though it is only a temporary contract,[sr]I have honored you by becoming a Chaldean Servant!
[k]

＠Ishtar
I'll do whatever you want, as long as it doesn't bore me, okay☆?

Wow... First Miss Artemis, now Ishtar... That's the second time we get a real goddess Servant, huh...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Wait, now's not the time to be worrying about that.[sr]Let's go over the basics.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Ishtar. You're a Pseudo-Servant, right?[sr]As in you use a human body as a vessel?
[k]

＠Ishtar
That's right. Divine Spirits can't normally be used as human familiars. The difference in scale between us is just too great.

＠Merlin
And since it's so different, you can't come here from the world you moved to.
[k]

＠Merlin
With the Age of Gods over, Divine Spirits simply watch over human history. This era is no different.
[k]

＠Merlin
The reason you're able to manifest as a Servant is that you've possessed a human you're compatible with... Is that right?

＠Ishtar
That's important, of course, but what's also important is the shape of the soul, so to speak. What kind of person they were.
[k]

＠Ishtar
If they're like me, Ishtar, then they're compatible.
[k]

[charaFace E 8]
＠Ishtar
But what about it?[sr]You've got Pseudo-Servants with you too.

＠Dr. Roman
Yes, we've seen several during our travels through the Singularities, but never one like you.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You seem to have been summoned into this era.[sr]But how did that happen?
[k]

[communicationCharaClear]
[wait communicationChara]

[charaTalk E]
[charaFace E 11]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
＠Ishtar
Oh, that, huh?[sr]Honestly, I'm not sure myself...
[k]

＠Ishtar
What I do know is that the Matron at the Sacred Temple in Uruk tried to summon me.
[k]

＠Ishtar
But she was doing it in a really roundabout way.
[k]

[charaFace E 8]
＠Ishtar
Since Uruk was about to become a Singularity, it was able to connect with different eras.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Normally, time and space are paired together, but Singularities can cross over them both, right?
[k]

＠Ishtar
So I guess she found a mage girl who was compatible with me in some era or another, and summoned me into her.
[k]

＠Ishtar
At which point, I became a Pseudo-Servant, and the Temple Matron forcibly summoned me to the land of Uruk.
[k]

[charaFace E 11]
＠Ishtar
Well, because of how it was done, I don't really remember what happened around the time I was summoned.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The next thing I knew, the Matron had died from draining herself of magical energy.
[k]

＠Ishtar
When I went outside, the path that connected Heaven and Earth[line 2]the thread that had barely held on from the Age of Gods[line 2]was gone.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Gilgamesh built the fortress cities and said that humanity could get by on its own, so gods weren't needed anymore.
[k]

[charaFace E 8]
＠Ishtar
Do you know how confused I was when I saw that?[sr]I felt like shooting everything in sight with my bow.

＠Dr. Roman
I see. That explains a lot.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So, it wasn't Solomon's Grail that summoned you.[sr]It was Uruk's Sacred Temple.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But that leaves one problem.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_2 1.0]
＠Dr. Roman
As Chaldea's representative...[sr]No, as a doctor... I have an ethical problem with this.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]

What's going on with the girl you possessed?[sr]Are you in total control of her?

＠Dr. Roman
...You're right. I'm afraid I don't have a good response to that...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But my mistake and your problem are different matters. And that's why I'm asking you.

＠Ishtar
...Humph. That's a good answer.[sr]I've changed my opinion of you a little.
[k]

[charaFace E 7]
＠Ishtar
So I'll answer your question. If you're asking if I killed the owner of this body, then no.
[k]

＠Ishtar
If you're asking if her mind can take control, that's a “no” too.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Ishtar
She and I have become one. Right now, it's about a 70/30 ratio with me as the majority.
[k]

＠Ishtar
When a Divine Spirit and a human become a Pseudo-Servant, the Divine Spirit has more spiritrons, and therefore the main personality is me.
[k]

[charaFace E 7]
＠Ishtar
Well, the original me, Inanna in the higher dimensions, isn't as humanlike as my current form.
[k]

＠Ishtar
But neither of us is more important than the other.[sr]I'm always going to be me, no matter what.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I can only possess a person who's capable of seeing things that way anyway.
[k]

＠Ishtar
So think of it this way.
[k]

＠Ishtar
It's not that this person was taken over by Ishtar...[sr]It's that she suddenly became the new Ishtar.
[k]

？1：I see. I don't get that at all.

[charaFace E 0]
＠Ishtar
That's fine. I'm still not sure which of us is which myself.
[k]

？2：So that girl is not asleep...

[charaFace E 7]
＠Ishtar
Yes. I am “me” when I speak to you.[sr]It's like two personalities merged into one.
[k]

？！

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 1.0]

＠Ishtar
Anyway! I'm saying that I'm me!

＠Ishtar
Now that I've got a new contract, it's time to say goodbye to this mountain!
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Ishtar
I had nowhere to go in Uruk so I built a temple on[sr]Mt. Ebih, but there's really nothing here.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The mountain range is cut open like a cake. We're so deep in the mountains that no worshippers would come visit.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Not even a cute deer.[sr]Only a forest full of venomous snakes!
[k]

[charaFace E 8]
＠Ishtar
I know I was the one who chose this place, but I'm really not sure why I did.
