My, what a lovely little hideout.[sr]I like it. I'll take the study next door.

[charaFace H 1]

I'll be unpacking, so call me if you need me.[sr]Oh, and don't forget to knock.

Just stay there and listen.[sr]Mash, you and [%1] too.

Jack the Ripper is back.[sr]And this time they're not murdering women in the fog.
[k]

＠Jekyll
They're currently putting Scotland Yard under siege.[sr]I'm picking up calls for help from stations all over London.

That guy![sr]That bastard finally came out!
[k]

？1：Sounds like a grudge.

？2：An acquaintance?

？！

＠Mordred
Yeah. A Servant of Assassin class.[sr]We fought a few times in the fog...
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
Escapes every time.[sr]I can't quite finish 'em off. They escape into the fog!
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
On top of that, I can't remember a face, figure, or[sr]specific abilities! It pisses me off!
[k]

＠Mordred
Every time I hear "Jack the Ripper,"[sr]all I can do is think, "Oh yeah, that Assassin!"

Dammit! It's so frustrating![sr]That stupid little[line 3]

Oh...

[charaFace A 15]

Yes, I think I do...[sr]I think it was an Assassin. We...were ambushed...
[k]

＠Mash
That's right... We were ambushed.[sr]My memories suddenly came back to me.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I couldn't remember most of the details until now.[sr]But, if it's a Servant, we can guess why[line 3]
[k]

？1：A skill?

？2：A Noble Phantasm?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes, Senpai. That's right.[sr]It's due to either a skill or a Noble Phantasm.

What, stepping out? Then say so.[sr]Bring me back...I know! Some scones would be great.

＠Mordred
You're not coming!?[sr]No, you wouldn't be useful if you did...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
...Wait.[sr]Can you make them easier to beat, like that last one?
[k]

＠Andersen
The last one was an extreme exception. Don't count on[sr]it. What do you expect an author to do to begin with?
[k]

＠Andersen
Do you think authors are all-powerful, omniscient gods?[sr]Then you need to learn better.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Andersen
Listen to me. Authors are just fools who fled to the pen[sr]when reality wouldn't go their way.
[k]

[charaFace H 2]
＠Andersen
Do you really think I can help you with anything?
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
...I was stupid for asking.[sr]Let's go, Mash, [%1]!
