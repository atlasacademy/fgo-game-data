Where did those beasts come from? I've never seen or heard of anything like them...

？1：They were... octopuses...
？2：We're just as surprised.

...How suspicious. It's clear that you aren't subjects of the Sun King, but...
[k]

＠Nitocris
Where exactly are you from? Are you mountain people, or citizens of the Holy City?
[k]

＠Nitocris
And besides, what exactly is a Master? I heard the pharaoh mention that term a few times...

You're a Servant, but you don't know what a Master is?

Even if you were summoned by the Singularity... the Holy Grail, you should have at least some knowledge as a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace E 7]
＠Nitocris
I was summoned by the great pharaoh[line 3][sr]the Sun King Ozymandias.
[k]

＠Nitocris
He ordered me to work for him.[sr]That's all I need to know.
[k]

＠Nitocris
I don't know what it means to be a Servant.
[k]

＠Nitocris
I'm a pharaoh first and foremost. Being a Heroic Spirit comes second.

＠Da Vinci
Queen Nitocris. You're in charge of these sandstorms... Well, not just them, but the protection of the desert as a whole.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You haven't been given any other knowledge at all.[sr]Am I correct in assuming this?
[k]

＠Nitocris
I wouldn't say none at all. I am aware of the state of the war.
[k]

＠Nitocris
Pharaoh Ozymandias rose to power not long after being summoned to this era.
[k]

＠Nitocris
This territory of Egypt is proof of that. The pharaoh saved his subjects that were summoned together with the land.
[k]

？1：Subjects were summoned with the land?

＠Nitocris
That's right. Likely due to the pharaoh's great power.
[k]

＠Nitocris
For normal Heroic Spirit summons, it's only the individual... the hero themselves. However, Pharaoh Ozymandias was different.
[k]

＠Nitocris
In his case, he is the nation. When he appears, it is only natural that his lands would also be restored.
[k]

？2：Territory of Egypt?

＠Nitocris
That's what I said, yes. Is there an issue? Did you enter this place without even knowing what it was?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Yes, be lenient with us. With the sudden sandstorm, we had to keep moving forward.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We couldn't help it. There weren't any border lines, and we were suddenly in Egyptian territory.
[k]

＠Nitocris
...
[k]

？！

＠Nitocris
...Anyway. The pharaoh showed us his right to rule as king.
[k]

＠Nitocris
However, there were some who opposed him. They were the indigenous[line 3]the Saracen mountain people...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And the citizens of the Holy City you mentioned.[sr]The people of Jerusalem, right?
[k]

＠Nitocris
[line 3]Wait a second.[sr]Did you just say Jerusalem?

All those who live in this land already know that!

？！

[charaFace E 2]
＠Nitocris
I thank you for saving me. However, this is a different issue altogether!
[k]

＠Nitocris
I knew I couldn't allow you to enter the great temple! Your actions will be what decides that!

＠Nitocris
Come, envoys of the king![sr]Ascertain the truth of these people!

No, I won't fight. That's the least I can do to pay you back. They will be the ones to test you.

...You have a choice before you. Live in this land and dedicate yourselves to the Sun King. Or you may refuse.
[k]

＠Nitocris
Refusal means that the wastelands of death will be your final resting place. Either that, or the Lion King's...
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Nitocris
No. No, that will not happen. Fate converges upon our king, Ozymandias!

Hm. The kings of Egypt, the pharaohs, had a different level of authority than the kings of other nations.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They were worshipped as gods that rule over men, and they flaunted their power as such.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
A living god is the most suitable term. However[line 3]Queen Nitocris... I feel a little sorry for her.
[k]

？1：...She's too nice?
？2：...She's too much of a normal person?

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
Yes, exactly. The sphinx's power is being kept to about 10%.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This may be convenient for us, but living as a pharaoh like this must be harsh for her.
