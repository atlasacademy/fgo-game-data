I heard [%1] was in a bit of trouble, so I hurried over on my flying nimbus!

Now that I'm here, a Demon God Pillar or two, no, a hundred is nothing to me!

So I was just on a pleasure trip.

I have no reason to punish the Demon Gods, nor do I have a reason to aid Chaldea!

Nitocris kept nagging me to come see an unusual temple here.

＠Ozymandias
For the woman of the heavens to make such request is very rare. Therefore, I have tagged along on this whim of hers...

Why haven't they put in pest control![sr]I cannot see the throne in this state!

There aren't that many kings who carry around their own grave to signify their brilliance.
