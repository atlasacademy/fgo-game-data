[line 2]You can't feel joy.

No, that's not quite right. It's not that you can't, it's that you don't.

You've trapped yourself in a cage, ceding your body to a “system” called a “king.”

Since you feel no joy, you fight automatically and mechanically. If you don't do so, you can't continue being king.

[charaFace D 7]
＠Nightingale
No, I haven't seen it myself.[sr]I simply know, because that's how I used to be.
[k]

[charaFace D 7]
＠Nightingale
I cast aside my own humanity,[sr]working only to fulfill my goal.
[k]

＠Nightingale
I had to pay a price for that,[sr]but I didn't mind.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Nightingale
I was fine being nothing more than a healing machine.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Nightingale
Of course, I can't deny that it's a twisted way of life.[sr]Nothing changed from when I was alive, working tenaciously at patient's bedside.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Nightingale
But still, I didn't mind. I simply wanted to help expand to the world, with an iron body and an iron will.

[charaFace D 7]

For that, I abandoned everything I had, but I have no regrets!
[k]

[charaFace D 7]
＠Nightingale
[line 2]So let me ask, king of savages.[sr]Is your rule truly necessary?
[k]

[charaFace D 7]
＠Nightingale
What prospects for the future do you have?[sr]Where do you aim to be, after all is done?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Who knows.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Nightingale
You have nothing. Your deeds are like severe burns.[sr]That's why[line 2]you and I are different.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Nightingale
My blood boils, for the sake of dreams. Your blood has grown thick and cold, for the sake of ambition.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Nightingale
That is your illness.[sr]Allow me to treat you, Cú Chulainn.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Even if I die, I must treat you.

Ill. Ill. Illness, huh? I see, I get it. Pretty fitting. I was used to things like curses and wounds, but[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
I'd never actually suffered from illness before.[sr]This what you'd call “seeing the light,” iron woman.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
That must mean this overbearing sense of fatigue is an illness.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
If this body is healed, and this blood is purified, I might return to my senses.

[charaFace A 5]

[line 2]But that's not possible.[sr]I think you're well aware of that.
