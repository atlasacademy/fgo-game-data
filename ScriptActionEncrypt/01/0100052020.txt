[charaFace A 2]

...Wait a second, how many of them are there?[sr]They just keep coming!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Elisabeth
Did you really clean up 60% of them?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Robin Hood
Well yeah, of course. I take my work seriously.[sr]It's one of my few redeeming qualities.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Robin Hood
Poisoning their food and water, burning, drowning, dropping rocks... Even some treachery amongst them.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Robin Hood
I used all sorts of tricks to cut out 60% of them.[sr]But there's still many left. Don't you just hate it?

...Seriously, what is it with those guys?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

Normally when you lose 60% of your troops,[sr]morale plummets and retreat is par for the course.

Beowulf. You're the warrior known for killing the monster Grendel with your bare hands. In that case[line 3]
