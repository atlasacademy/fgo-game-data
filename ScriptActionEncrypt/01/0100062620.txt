＠Ozymandias
So you bested Nitocris. Good. I congratulate you.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Ozymandias
State your business, foreign Master. Are you here to leave me your head, or to beg for mercy?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Ozymandias
I will allow either of those. I will kill you however you want.
[k]


？1：We already stated our business.

？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Ozymandias
Huh? The message from earlier? It said you wanted me to fight alongside you, but...
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Ozymandias
Unbelievable! You were serious?! Hahahahahahahahahaha!
[k]

＠Ozymandias
To think that I cannot see through the truth and lies! If I must burn you alive to stop my laughter then that is what I shall do, but...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Ozymandias
I forgive you. Yes, I shall forgive you! How long has it been since I've laughed this much!?
[k]

＠Ozymandias
I'll admit it, foreign master! You have a gift!
[k]

＠Ozymandias
A gift for seeing dreams so far removed from reality! A gift that I, not knowing imagination, don't possess, fuhahahahahaha!

Turn the mocking down a notch. Me aside, [%1] is serious.
[k]

＠Sanzang
And, let's stop laughing at what isn't fun. You don't think it's all that funny either, do you?
[k]

＠Sanzang
I didn't enter the grand temple, but I have been a guest at many other oases and temples.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Sanzang
There, I've listened to stories told by many people from this nation: stories of a cold-blooded and narcissistic king, and yet a king that rationally protects his people.
[k]

＠Sanzang
You're different from the Lion King. You prioritize the lives of your people.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Because you know that is the best way for a country to prosper. Because you think that is the duty of a king.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Sanzang
Except...
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Sanzang
Except, you are going to abandon that duty. You say you don't know imagination, right?
[k]

＠Sanzang
You realized that if you were to fight the Lion King, you would both fall. That's why you wouldn't fight.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Sanzang
So, you chose the path of closing your country by summoning that desert into the world!
[k]

＠Sanzang
You can't beat the Lion King, so you are trying to lock your country's people in this temple!
[k]

＠Sanzang
You were shown a path where you could leave this paradox, no, resignation... Why can't you just be honest to yourself and say “Yes!”?
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Fool, what would come of joining in this nonsense with no hope of victory! What would happen when we defeat the Lion King?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Ozymandias
Through the Incineration of Humanity, the world will be burned away. If that's the case, it's pointless to defeat only the Lion King.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Ozymandias
I will use my power to save my people! What happens to other people is none of my concern!

Enough is enough! For both you and the Lion King! You're just as selfish as Wukong!

Yes, a monkey. Now that you mention it, you two look like each other.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Sanzang
You done interrupting me? You see, the end of the world is knocking on your door!
[k]

＠Sanzang
Even if you're fine with it, your people don't want to lose this desert! Why can't you understand that!?
[k]

＠Sanzang
You've been saying “I'll protect my people, I'll protect my people,” but isn't that just the same as the Lion King!?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Sanzang
Pharaoh Ozymandias is the strongest in all of Egypt, right!? Then show me how great you are.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Instead of “I'll protect my people,” try saying “I'll protect this world!” You're the real fool!

However, he will not get mad. Her reason is but a child's. He would lose his pride as a king if he took a child's tantrum seriously.

？2：He's really laughing now...

？！

＠Ozymandias
To protect the world!? You are asking me to protect the world!? The shameful world of humans!?
[k]

＠Ozymandias
What I protect is the law of the gods! In the end, you claim I am merely protecting my own subjects!?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Ozymandias
But, yes. That possibility was outside of my calculations.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Ozymandias
...Just as I expected. I am always an obstacle to you brave heroes.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
This prominent king is once again a tyrant that needs to be defeated.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
As such, were I in any era, any world, I would have reigned as your enemy.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Pharaoh Ozymandias cannot save the world. The reason being I am the king on the side that rules and intimidates.

[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Ozymandias
Xuanzang Sanzang, that was quite the question! However, there is one fatal flaw in what you said!
[k]

＠Ozymandias
This is a reward for making me laugh from the bottom of my heart. From the hand of King Ozymandias, I will compensate you!

It's impossible to manifest something with that level of divinity to this world! However, it's a different story if you grant that name to a Demon God Pillar!

Although it's temporary, that's a true Divine Spirit... A monster that far exceeds that of a Demon God Pillar!
