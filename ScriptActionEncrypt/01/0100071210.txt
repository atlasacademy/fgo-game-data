Operation Defeat Quetzalcoatl begins now, Master.[sr]Let's head to Ur first.

Oh, gatekeeper. Here's the seal from King Gilgamesh permitting our departure.

You're...the gatekeeper that was on duty when we first came to Uruk.
[k]

＠Ana
This south gate was attacked by Quetzalcoatl...but are you all right?
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
Haha... Well it's embarrassing to say, but I wasn't even taken as an opponent.
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
Did you know that these past few days an unknown disease has been infecting people in Uruk?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Ana
...Yes. I hear the old and weak are the first to die.
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
I had the same symptoms as them. Didn't have an appetite for three whole days.
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
So when that goddess saw my face, she said, “Don't push yourself. Want a mango?”
[k]

Mango? You mean the fruit, mango? I've heard of it...[sr]But it existed in this age...?
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
Yes, and it was very tasty! Almost the instant I popped it in my mouth, I felt better! Thanks to that, I was able to resume my duties as a gatekeeper.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Ishtar
And you just ATE it!?
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
Hahaha, yes I did. That's one of the reasons I came to be stationed here at the south gate. Everyone's scared of this gate, you know.
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
So, um... I'm not so sure that the Goddess of the Jungle is actually evil, really.
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
I'm sure this is just bothersome to hear, but if you meet her, and it looks like you can speak with her...
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
Before you exchange blows, please try to talk to her. Maybe there's a way to solve this without fighting.

Don't worry, I'll be there to fight with you this time. Just watch closely and see which goddess is the more powerful one.

A talk with Quetzalcoatl, eh? It's true that there may be a way to avoid battle.
[k]

＠Merlin
She said she would eradicate humanity because her mother called her here to do so.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Merlin
Which means that she's not against mankind of her own free will.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

Though that does raise the question of who this “Mother” is.

Well, if you think about it, that does makes sense...[sr]How about it, Ishtar?

Did Gorgon order you two to exterminate mankind?

Huh? I couldn't care less about the Three Goddess Alliance.

Quetzalcoatl is a winged serpent, right? Maybe she's just helping out Gorgon because they're both snakes?

However, Quetzalcoatl is still the principal deity in Mesoamerican culture.

＠Merlin
No matter how much power Gorgon gained from the Holy Grail, Quetzalcoatl wouldn't serve her without cause.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Merlin
Just like the gatekeeper said, she probably has a reason. Leaving this “Mother” problem aside, it's a good idea to try and talk to her.

[charaFace F 1]

Yes, talk. Conversation is the best expression of human sincerity and kindness, [%1].
