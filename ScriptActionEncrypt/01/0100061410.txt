It's carefully guarded. However, the lookouts can't see very well at night. They might as well be scarecrows.

＠Fort Soldier A
Honestly, can't they give us a break? Making all of us come out here in the middle of the night...
[k]

＠Fort Soldier B
It can't be helped. A Knight of the Round Table is secretly visiting this fort. Any form of disrespect and our heads will roll.
[k]

＠Fort Soldier A
That's just it. It's a sudden visit without any prior communication, right? And it's not just any Knight of the Round Table.
[k]

＠Fort Soldier A
It's the secretary to His Majesty the Lion King, Agravain of Iron!
[k]

＠Fort Soldier A
What's the Round Table's second-in-command doing in a place like his? I thought he's not supposed to leave the Holy City?
[k]

＠Fort Soldier B
...Oh, I know. Remember we gave Sir Lancelot that horse the other day?
[k]

＠Fort Soldier B
You're not supposed to take a fort's resource without first consulting Sir Agravain... Maybe he's here to pass down his judgment.
[k]

＠Fort Soldier A
Seriously!? Upon our leader!?
[k]

＠Fort Soldier A
Yeah, well, he's a piece of garbage who treats refugees like dirt. If he gets fired, it'd be doing us a favor...
[k]

＠Fort Soldier B
...Or, it may be about the suspicious bowman we captured the other day.
[k]

＠Fort Soldier B
It took several Enforcement Knights to finally capture him. Perhaps Sir Agravain is here to kill him with his own hands?
[k]

＠Fort Soldier A
Seriously!? He's going to be executed? I don't understand a word he's saying, but he's not a bad guy, ya know?
[k]

＠Fort Soldier A
And ever since he came, our meals got so much better. I actually wanted him to join our side.
[k]

＠Fort Soldier B
...No no, perhaps... Sir Agravain is after the Old Man of the Mountain we've locked up in our dungeon.
[k]

＠Fort Soldier B
I hear she's quite a beauty, but she's tight-lipped. Even the torturers gave up...
[k]

＠Fort Soldier B
Sir Agravain is the best interrogator at the Round Table... They say he's so good he can literally make a hippo scream for help...
[k]

＠Fort Soldier A
Seriously!? As in an actual word, help? Just how brutal can Sir Agravain be?
[k]

＠Fort Soldier A
And just how much trouble can one fort hold!? Man, I want to move to the Holy City, too!
[k]

＠Fort Soldier B
No no, perhaps...

Seriously!? You got more!?

I can hear a pin drop thousands of kilometers away. ...The group of horses headed for this fort is already very near.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
We'll most likely encounter the enemy group as we emerge from the dungeon. That'll complicate our escape.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
Let's split into two parties. One will break in and rescue the Servants.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
The other will remain here and, after Agravain's entourage appears, launch an ambush on the fort, creating a diversion.

Not quite. Forts are all built the same no matter where you go. Breaking into a fort is one of the most basic skills for any Hassan.

Moreover, the entrance of a dungeon can be easily found by tracing the human psyche.

That is, hide it in the deepest and darkest corner that can neither be heard by enemies nor seen by friends...
