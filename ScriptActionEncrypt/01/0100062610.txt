Of course it was...

“We're gonna ask you to join our cause, so be ready when we come get you!”

Of course. King Ozymandias is the personification of human confidence, arrogance, and narcissism.

＠Sanzang
With someone like that, modesty will have the opposite effect!
[k]

＠Sanzang
We need to display our own strength, stand firm and say “Hey, we can be worthy opponents!”

[charaFace B 0]
＠Ozymandias
It seems my judgment was clouded as I took the Holy Grail so rashly.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Until now, everyone has been fighting over this Holy Grail. Even after they were made aware of the fact that their world and future would be incinerated.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Nay, perhaps that only deepened their desire. Even after they become Heroic Spirits, a hero is capable of great sins.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Ozymandias
Fearing it would lead to further ruin, I kept it in my possession... it seems now I am suffering for it.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Ozymandias
My intention was to seal the Grail, but doing so also sealed away my freedom.
[k]

“If I have the Grail, even the Lion King can't easily make his move” I said... What a joke.

No. Your judgment was correct, O Pharaoh.
[k]

＠Nitocris
Heroic Spirits are greedy beings, but you, and only you, are different from the others.
[k]

＠Nitocris
A pharaoh who was more prosperous than anyone on this earth. You alone have not sought after the Grail.

＠Ozymandias
Also, are you not a pharaoh as well? You, the incarnation of the sky god, Horus.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Ozymandias
If you want, I can give you the Grail. Well, how about it? It's not too late.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
You are already a Heroic Spirit. Using the Grail to turn into the real Horus might not be so bad.

＠Nitocris
...I am far too immature to be a pharaoh. Hence, I shall not refer to myself as one in front of you.

The Holy Grail belongs to you. I am content to be but a guardian of the mirror to the underworld.

＠Ozymandias
The outcome will not change no matter what the Lion King chooses to do. That's how perfect a plan the King of Mages devised.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
To wait for your extinction or to flee... The Lion King chose the latter. Truly a wise decision.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

...And me? What would I, the Sun King, do when faced with such decisions?

This grand temple feels just like the Lion King's Holy City. I know this place will be a shelter, too.

＠Sanzang
...King Ozymandias has the same means as the Lion King.
