＠Andersen
In light of Mr. Jekyll's urgent need for rest,[sr]I'll get right to the point.
[k]

＠Andersen
What bothered me in the first place was[sr]the relationship between "Heroic Spirits" and "Servants."
[k]

＠Andersen
Heroic Spirits are records or results of human history.
[k]

＠Andersen
Be they real or fictional,[sr]they'll exist as long as humanity does.
[k]

＠Andersen
But a Servant is something different.[sr]This treats a Heroic Spirit as an "existence" in reality...
[k]

＠Andersen
A familiar given a container called a Class and "made real," when its existence is uncertain to begin with.
[k]

[charaFace H 2]
＠Andersen
But I ask you, Jekyll and Roman, was it? Is such[sr]a thing possible with the powers of a human, a mage?
[k]

＠Andersen
Turning a Heroic Spirit into a familiar[line 3]I see,[sr]that's powerful. The strongest summoning spell imaginable.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
But a human couldn't handle such a spell on their own.[sr]If it's possible, it would be[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A being greater than humans. An "Authority" exercised[sr]by a supernatural being, labeled as world or god. Is that it?
[k]

＠Andersen
Indeed. Heroic Spirits can't be summoned with human[sr]power alone. There needs to be some other reason[line 3]
[k]

＠Andersen
It needs an extra push from something else, I think.
[k]

[charaFadeout H 0.1]
[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 0]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Mash
...Um.[sr]Isn't that the Holy Grail?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
It's a fact that up to this point, many Servants[sr]have been summoned thanks to the Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]
[charaTalk H]
[charaFace H 0]
[charaFadein H 0.1 1]
＠Andersen
Indeed. You spoke of the seven Singularities.[sr]Seven Holy Grails driving the different eras mad.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
That's why I asked Dr. Roman[sr]about the Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Andersen
What exactly is the Holy Grail War that enables Heroic[sr]Spirit Summons? For what reason was it created?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yup. I don't have detailed data, but the origin is a town[sr]in rural Japan. The flaming city you visited, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
There, they made a vessel for the Holy Grail, used its[sr]power to summon Heroic Spirits, who they had compete as Servants.
[k]

[charaFace H 2]
＠Andersen
That's what seemed weird to me. There's a flaw[sr]in the concept of making Heroic Spirits fight each other.
[k]

＠Andersen
It felt like there was something else going on.[sr]So I decided to read the Mage's Association archives.
[k]

[charaFace H 3]
＠Andersen
And I found what I expected.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
The original Heroic Spirit summoning ritual[sr]was a ceremony to pit seven powers against one.
[k]

＠Andersen
It wasn't something where seven Heroic Spirits[sr]fought one another.
[k]

＠Andersen
"Ritual: Heroic Spirit Summon" and "Ritual: Holy Grail War" are the same systems with different genres, you could say.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Andersen
"Holy Grail War" altered an existing spell[sr]and used it for selfish human purposes.
[k]

＠Andersen
Meanwhile, it's base spell "Heroic Spirit Summon"...
[k]

＠Andersen
...was a ritual to put "humanity's strongest seven Heroic Spirits" against "a single powerful enemy."
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
That's what got distorted in the Fuyuki Holy Grail War.
[k]

？1：...Then you and the others are also?

＠Andersen
Yeah. Since there are only supposed to be seven of them, all the Heroic Spirits that got summoned[sr]later[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
Well, they're cheap, convenient,[sr]multi-purpose familiars.
[k]

？2：...So um... What?

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
...For now, just know that the Ritual: Holy Grail War[sr]was based off of something else.
[k]

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Hmm, I see! I see![sr]An interesting theory.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Chaldea wasn't able to make its own summoning system[sr]from the ground up.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We modified and stabilized the Fuyuki ritual,[sr]but never considered the possibility of an older original.

＠Mash
Yes, Doctor.[sr]This is a viewpoint we've never heard before.
[k]

＠Mash
It casts doubt about the fundamental nature of the Holy Grail War.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
I thought I knew what Heroic Spirits were originally.[sr]But it was nothing more than information[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
It wasn't nearly at the level of what you just pointed out.[sr]That's very impressive, Mr. Andersen.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I guess this is the keen eye of observation[sr]owned by an author that left his name in history.
[k]

？1：Maybe so.

？2：What you'd call an objective perspective?

Of course it is. I just felt a hitch[sr]with the Heroic Spirit summoning system.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
If we're all normal Classes[sr]summoned by a single system[line 3]
[k]

＠Andersen
I wondered what kind of Spirit Origins[sr]the original seven for this system must have had.
[k]

＠Andersen
...And someone else thought the same thing.
[k]

＠Andersen
I don't think it's coincidence that information about this,[sr]even the parts you'd expect to be lost, was all in one place.
[k]

＠Andersen
"Someone" predicted our coming,[sr]and put it there.

I don't think it would be a mage, but I don't know why[sr]a Servant would do it. We'll have to set that aside for now.
