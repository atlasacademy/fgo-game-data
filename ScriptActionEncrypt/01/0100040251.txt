＠Dr. Roman
The motion response is gone.[sr]Either they retreated or are hiding within the fog.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...Right. That was a dangerous, hostile Servant.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
From the area analysis I did during the battle, a part of[sr]this fog is likely from the Noble Phantasm of that Servant.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But the fog of magical energy that covers London[sr]is something else entirely.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In short, it was a combination of the two fogs.[sr]We've got a really difficult opponent on our hands...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The fog contains such a high density of sulfuric acid[sr]that there's no way this is a normal phenomenon.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Also... And this is the most troubling aspect, Mash...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
I know. My memory seems to have been altered.[sr]We just fought...and yet...
[k]

＠Mash
...the memory of my opponent is a blur.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I only remember one thing.[sr]It was a Servant.
[k]

＠Mash
The form, the name, and...[sr]There's some other memory related to it, but...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Hmm. Seems like the effect can transcend eras.[sr]My memory is kind of vague, too.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
At this rate, the observation record may be distorted,[sr]too. What a strange Noble Phantasm it is...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Speaking of bizarre[line 3][sr]That's right. Doctor, we, um...
[k]

？1：We were filming...

？2：What about the giant robot from earlier?

？！

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
Ah! That's right. We were filming.[sr]Senpai, I'm sorry... Thank you.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
It seems the effect on your memory is weak, Senpai.[sr]Lucky for us!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's right! Yup. Right. I received it.[sr]I received image data for a mysterious robot.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm going to proceed in analyzing these images.[sr]I wonder what it is?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It doesn't look like a golem that runs on magical energy,[sr]but it also doesn't look like a complete machine...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Doctor, are you versed in mechanical engineering?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm no expert, but I am a member of Chaldea.[sr]Albeit as medical staff.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Hmm, this is... Don't tell me we've just come[sr]across some lost steam engine technology.
[k]

＠E：???
Oh, that[line 3]?
[k]

＠E：???
It's just a clump of steel, right?[sr]We call it...
[k]

＠E：???
[line 3]Helter Skelter.

I've been watching you. You destroyed one of them,[sr]which means you're probably not my enemy.

＠E：???
Besides, you fought well, not bad. Considering you[sr]probably have no idea about the circumstances.

Very nice.[sr]I rather like fools like that.

You're right.[sr]I'm sure we're not your enemy.
[k]

＠Mash
Please... Can you give us some information.[sr]Will you speak with us?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
What's happening in this foggy city?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠E：???
Very well.[sr]I'll talk to you.
[k]

＠E：???
But first, let me get one thing straight.[sr]You're a Demi-Servant, aren't you?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...Yes. My name is Mash Kyrielight.[sr]And I am a Demi-Servant.
[k]

＠E：???
And who are you?
[k]

？1：I'm [%1].

？！

[charaFace E 4]
＠E：???
Mash Kyrielight and [%1], huh?[sr]...I suppose that's all right. It has nothing to do with me.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

I am Mordred. A Heroic Spirit.[sr]And[line 3]
