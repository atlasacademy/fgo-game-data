[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
I, um...
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
What? Speak up.[sr]If you have something to say, just say it.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
All right, then.

＠Mash
I have a question for you.[sr]Why are you fighting here?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Mr. Jekyll is fighting to protect his hometown.[sr]But what about you[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
I already told you, didn't I? I'm here to face the perils[sr]of Father's beloved Londinium.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
Well, sure...[sr]I mean...
[k]

＠Mash
Yes, I did hear that when we first met.[sr]I understand that, really, but...
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
I hope you won't get upset, but for some reason,[sr]I... I feel like...it's for a different reason.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
...Jeez.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
All right.[sr]I didn't even tell Jekyll about this, you know?
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
I just[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
Yes, that's right. I just can't allow the land of[sr]Britain to be violated by someone other than me.
[k]

＠Mordred
I'm the only one allowed to violate the land[sr]King Arthur loved. I can't let anyone else do that.
[k]

？1：...

？2：So distorted...

？！

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Hm? Did you say something?
[k]

？1：No, not at all.

？2：Not particularly.

？！

＠Mordred
If you want to say something, say it.[sr]Well, anyway...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
Don't worry.[sr]I will give you the Holy Grail once we find it.
[k]

＠Mordred
I won't say "I want it after all" or anything.[sr]And even if I did, it wouldn't serve any purpose.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
I'm Mordred, the Treacherous Knight. But this time[sr]it's special, and I'll be on the defender's side.
[k]

＠Mordred
Honestly, I was hesitating a bit.[sr]Meeting you guys cleared up my mind.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
What do you mean?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
I mean, someone worthy of being the owner finally[sr]showed up. You can have the Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
???
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Enough chitchat.[sr]Don't bring up this topic ever again.

＠Mordred
We're almost at the mansion, but enemies are here[sr]again. Well then, shall we rip them apart?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Mordred's detection is amazing. Is it an Intuition skill?[sr]We detected hostile reactions too. There'll be three waves!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Roger.[sr]Master, orders please!
