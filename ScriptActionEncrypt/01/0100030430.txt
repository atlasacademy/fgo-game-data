The summoning circle has been established,[sr]but communications are still cut off.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
We should move away from here, perhaps.

Huh?[sr]Hey, what's wrong? Something up?

＠Pirate
Boss...[sr]The ship won't move.

[charaFace D 2]
＠Drake
Huh?
[k]

＠Pirate
The ship, Boss![sr]The ship won't budge, not an inch!

...Sorry,[sr]but could you guys wait a second?

No good, it won't move. But I don't think[sr]there's anything wrong with the ship itself.

＠Drake
It's stuck like something's anchoring it real tight.
[k]

＠Drake
What on earth is happening?[sr][%1], this is your specialty, right?
[k]

？1：A type of Magecraft?

？2：A type of Bounded Field?

Yes, I believe that is correct.[sr]It looks like a Bounded Field has been drawn all around.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Its rank is low enough for Demi-Servants like me to[sr]escape... But I can't say the same for the ship.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Unless we take down whoever is creating this field,[sr]I'm afraid we'll be stuck here forever.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
What are we gonna do?
[k]

＠Mash
Search and destroy.[sr]There is no other means of escape.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
All right, if you say so then it must be true.[sr]Men! Stand your ground!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Drake
Behave and stay put. The real fight's gonna be above[sr]sea. Don't be wasting stuff!

This is rather dull.[sr]That fortress earlier was completely empty, too.

＠Mash
To begin with, it's mysterious that artificial structures[sr]are on this island.
[k]

＠Mash
But that pattern... Could it be?

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
...Hmmm?[sr]Is there a hole in that mountain?
[k]

？1：Let's take a look.

？2：Let's go inside.

Is this what you call a dungeon?[sr]Oh boy, the pirate blood in me is heating up!

＠Mash
Wait! We have no idea what the scope of this place is.[sr]I suggest we retreat at once and[line 2]

＠Drake
The way I see it, retreating's not gonna change a thing.[sr]That's what it means to stay on my ship.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Leave behind that goodie-goodie old self, Mash![sr]Now, onwards! Treasure awaits!

I think we're rushing it too much...
