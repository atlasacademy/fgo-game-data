Time for the Greater Grail. This will be our last break.[sr]Is there anything you've left undone?
[k]

？1：No, I'm ready.

That's good to hear. I dislike Masters who can't[sr]make up their minds when push comes to shove.

You're still a rookie, but you've got the most important thing a pioneer can have.
[k]

＠Caster
The divine luck to grasp fate, and the ability to make decisions.
[k]

＠Caster
Don't forget how to be reckless. People like that[sr]are the ones who'll get blessed by the stars.
[k]

？2：Can we go back to the base first?

[charaFace F 1]
＠Caster
If it's necessary, then by all means go back.[sr]We're attacking a bear in its hole, so we need plenty of supplies.

Huh? Ah...Yeah, this doesn't look very good.[sr]It's because of the unexpected Servant contract...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You never used your magic circuits and now they're[sr]running at full capacity. It's probably putting stress on your brain.

Mash, set up camp.[sr]It's time to make warm tea with plenty of honey.

？1：Um, what is it, Director?

No, I'm full! But from now on, remember that I like coffee more than tea!

N-No, that's not it.[sr]That's not what I wanted to... Oh, forget it!

Th-The work you've done so far, has been passable.[sr]As the director of Chaldea, I have to give you credit.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
...Hmph. What's that look for?[sr]I'm sure it's a fluke, but right now you're all we've got.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
What I'm saying is, keep it up and you might hear praise[sr]from me yet. I know that even a third-rater can do first-rate work.

Well, well, admitting that [%1] did a[sr]solid job. Have you eaten something sweet?

Romani. If you've got time to be flapping your gums,[sr]use it to send [%1] a supply or two instead.

What's this? "Feel bad?" How kind of you. Director,[sr]does this mean you're finally opening up your heart?

Idio... I-I meant pitiful! Pathetic![sr]You couldn't even tell that?

Well, I never grow tired of watching young men and[sr]women interact. Although when it comes to young women, Director, you're not really...
