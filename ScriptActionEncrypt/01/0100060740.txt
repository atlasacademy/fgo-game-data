＠Dr. Roman
Sir Gawain! He's the one called the Knight of the Sun and wields the second sacred sword!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
There's no more doubt about it!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It was King Arthur's knights, the Knights of the Round Table, who annihilated the Crusaders and built a Holy City upon the Holy Land!
[k]

？1：The Arthur we met in Singularity F!?
？2：The Arthur we met in London!?

？！

＠Dr. Roman
No, this one's different.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Spirit Origin output observed from that Servant just now was far beyond that of King Arthur in our data!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's not even in the realm of a Servant! How did King Arthur become such a monster!?

＠Gawain
It seems you have a mage using a far-seeing spell... Then, you must be the defenders of humanity.
[k]

＠Gawain
“When the foreign star shines, the bond of the white wall crumbles, the king's power wanes, and the divine tower falls.”
[k]

＠Gawain
...How unfortunate. If our meeting was of a different nature, we may have found a path of coexistence.

Magical energy response has multiplied several times over! Gawain intends to fight!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Gawain is the wielder of the sister sword of Excalibur, a Noble Phantasm second only to King Arthur's...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Not only that, but it's daytime now, right!? In that case, you have no way to win! Get out of there!
[k]

？1：What's wrong with it being daytime!?

[line 3]You cannot escape. It's already impossible for you to withdraw on your own.
[k]

＠Gawain
You opened a way for the refugees to escape, then set foot into enemy lines to save that child.
[k]

＠Gawain
This is the price you must pay. Weren't you prepared for this to happen?
