[charaFace E 0]
＠Medb
Of course I would. I mean,[sr]Cú decided for himself to become king.
[k]

＠Medb
Not out of righteousness, or nobility, or even ambition. He just wanted to heighten himself.
[k]

＠Medb
The ones you sent to Alcatraz will be finished off by Beowulf, Fionn, and Diarmuid.
[k]

＠Medb
Well, even if they fail to, that's not a problem.[sr]Your defeat is already certain.

So long as we have the Holy Grail,[sr]this world will persistently continue to reincarnate.

Indeed, the fact you obtained the Grail is proof of your greatness.

However, while it is rare, it is not the “only one.”[sr]If anyone has the “only one,” it's us.

They have already recovered four Holy Grails.

It's fine to hone your strength and become a king.[sr]Even if the rule you impose is tyrannical.

However... How can you act without raising one eyebrow?

...I'm not trying to cast doubt on your conscience.[sr]You're not enjoying this in the first place.

I seek nothing. I don't need rewards.[sr]I don't even hope for a place to rest at my destination.

You are mistaken. Those contradict each other. The only path for you is to abandon one or the other, Cú Chulainn!
