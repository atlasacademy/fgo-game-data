It's all right to attack Uruk. It's all right to kill the enemy. But why kill without purpose?

Those humans would never become a threat to us. Eventually Tiamat would have killed them herself. They didn't matter!

I will not allow such pointless behavior from the new humans! Your behavior is completely foolish!

Nonsense. Even if that were true, what's wrong with that!?

Even if I weren't born from Mother, she still gave me life. I am her son.

＠Kingu
This body... I don't know a thing about Enkidu. They're nothing to me. I don't even have a record of their past!
[k]

＠Kingu
And what's wrong with that? All I need to exist is my purpose in serving Mother.
[k]

＠Kingu
Any other notions or extraneous sentiments are useless. I'm just a puppet who works for Tiamat.
[k]

＠Kingu
That is me. Kingu is just a puppet made for that purpose.
