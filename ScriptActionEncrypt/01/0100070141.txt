＠Enkidu
That poison dragon, Bašmu, was the last one. In any event, we have exterminated all the Demonic Beasts in this town.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Enkidu
But we are not safe yet. The scent of the blood of the fallen will draw more here.
[k]

＠Enkidu
This land has become a den for Demonic Beasts.[sr]Their number is likely to increase, not decrease.
[k]

？1：Who are you?

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Enkidu
I believe I have introduced myself. That invisible mage should know more details about me.

＠Dr. Roman
Yes. I apologize.[sr]Your display of power left me speechless!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm assuming you are the real Enkidu, correct?[sr]Not a Servant, but an actual living being?

＠Dr. Roman
Which means you're a native here. Yet you possess such power... No wonder you are called the Weapon of the Gods.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They were not lying when they said you're the world's strongest Noble Phantasm with a living will. It's even said you were on par with King Gilgamesh!
[k]

？1：Weapon of the Gods?
？2：Noble Phantasm with a living will?

＠Mash
Yes. Enkidu is found in the world's oldest heroic tale, the Epic of Gilgamesh.
[k]

＠Mash
Gilgamesh was a king that didn't listen to the gods; he was an individual with incredible power that lived in the moment.
[k]

＠Mash
In order to admonish King Gilgamesh, the gods sculpted a doll from mud.
[k]

＠Mash
The doll had a soul like humans, and could change its shape at will. At times it became a Noble Phantasm capable of piercing enemies.
[k]

＠Mash
The world's strongest god-made human, into which the gods poured all their energy. That's what Enkidu is.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's absolutely right! Mesopotamian civilization used mud to make any number of things.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And you can call Enkidu its greatest masterpiece!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Soft enough to change forms, yet sharp as the keenest blade! The manifestation of nature itself, able to bind and kill Divine Beasts.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
If King Gilgamesh, a mix of human and divine blood, is the Wedge of the Heavens created by the gods,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Enkidu is the Chain of the Heavens created to return Gilgamesh to the gods.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 8]
＠Dr. Roman
Da Vinci is sulking saying, “I can do something like that too.” But I'd say she's just putting up a front.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
In any event, nothing's more encouraging than to have Enkidu on humanity's side!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Not even the tyrannical King Gilgamesh could destroy this good-hearted hero!

＠Enkidu
...Umm. It is quite embarrassing to be complimented this much.
[k]

＠Enkidu
I am nothing more than a weapon created by the gods. How a weapon is used is up to its handler.
[k]

＠Enkidu
If I appear to have a good heart, then it is because the human who used me was good and lawful.

You're a... weapon?[sr]Yet you seem to have a heart...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Enkidu
Yes, I do have a heart.[sr]I don't have feelings though, or I didn't at first.
[k]

＠Enkidu
The only thing I possessed was knowledge of being a weapon: what I needed to destroy, and when I needed to act.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Enkidu
But there was one woman who treated me like any other human. I modeled myself in her form.
[k]

＠Enkidu
...She is responsible for me gaining a heart of my own.[sr]I keep this form in reverence for her gift to me.

A prostitute, and yet a saint: Shamhat.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Well, being a prostitute meant something different back then than it does now. But there is no need to get into that.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Enkidu. You called [%1] the Master of Chaldea.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Does that mean you understand our situation?

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠Enkidu
Yes. A Holy Grail that disrupts time, and the alteration of history by the one who wields it.
[k]

＠Enkidu
All this resulted in the Singularities, a plot to destroy the Foundation of Humanity by the Mage King.
[k]

＠Enkidu
The Temple Matron of Uruk made the situation clear.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Enkidu
I came here because of her prophecy.[sr]I was told to protect the promised group of outsiders.

＠Mash
So this era still hasn't been destroyed, correct?[sr]And you're fighting against the King of Mages?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Enkidu
Of course. I am not sure what the other eras were like, but people from the Age of Gods will not submit to world-ending disaster.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Whimsical gods have brought the world near to destruction many times in our era. People here are more resilient than you might think.

＠Enkidu
Yes, that is indeed troubling. They band together against the big problems, but struggle with the small ones.
[k]

＠Enkidu
But that is how it always is with humanity. Though, as you can see with how this town ended up...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Enkidu
Anyway, enough with introductions. The Demonic Beasts will come back if we spend too much time here.
[k]

＠Enkidu
I will guide you somewhere safer.[sr]We can discuss trivial matters on the way.
[k]

？1：Thanks, Enkidu.
？2：My name is [%1]. Thanks.

Good. Now that we've all got to know each other better, let's move. Are you going to take them to Uruk?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's the largest city in that world.[sr]The Leylines there should be stable.

Circle... A summoning circle, correct? Understood.[sr]Let us hurry.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Oh, yes. We will take the longer route to get there, so please bear that in mind.
[k]

＠Enkidu
We should try to avoid the Demonic Beasts. There is nothing more important than ensuring everyone's safety.

No, I am glad to do it. I'm pleased the Master from Chaldea has turned out to be someone like you.
[k]

＠Enkidu
I thought... Well, it was said that a representative of humanity would come...
[k]

＠Enkidu
So I was on alert, thinking someone like Gilgamesh would come. But I'm glad that fear proved unfounded.
