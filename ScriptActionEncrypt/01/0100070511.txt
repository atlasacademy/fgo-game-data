＠Ushiwakamaru
Splendid! With those skills, you shall win the day no matter what awaits you in Ur.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Benkei
Indeed. We are most reassured now in sending you off.

＠Benkei
However, please do be careful. It isn't just soldiers that haven't returned after heading into that jungle.
[k]

＠Benkei
Two other Heroic Spirits King Gilgamesh summoned, Amakusa Shirou and Fuuma Kotarou, have not returned either.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Lord Amakusa and Lord Kotarou, huh... I had thought perhaps the Twin Arm Brigade would, but...
[k]

？1：The king had summoned others!?
？2：So many Servants from Japan...

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Benkei
Exactly. The oni Ibaraki and Tomoe Gozen were here, too. Ibaraki broke off and disappeared somewhere,
[k]

＠Benkei
but Tomoe Gozen faced Girtablilu, the general of the Demonic Beasts, and they took each other out...

[charaFace C 5]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Ibaraki was mouthing off, saying she was going to organize a bandit group in this era, so I scared her and she ran off.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
As soon as I find her, as part of the Minamoto clan, I shall take responsibility in lopping her head off.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Ushiwakamaru
...Though, since we're talking about that oni, I'm sure she's doing nothing more than fuming in some ruins.
[k]

？1：A lot of things happened, huh?
？2：Ibaraki-Douji... I don't think we'll ever meet...

＠Ushiwakamaru
Likewise. Growing up in the mountains, I could only provide a boorish celebration. But it was a good, fulfilling battle.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
We eagerly await your return. While you are gone, leave the protection of Uruk to us.
[k]

？1：Thank you. We'll be on our way!
