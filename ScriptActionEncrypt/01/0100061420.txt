This place is bigger and more complicated than we thought, isn't it... We might be outside the fort grounds by now...

You don't seem to have noticed, Lady Mash. But we are three levels underground already.

What!? But I don't remember going down any stairs or slopes...

We've been walking down an incline from the start. Only those accustomed to the darkness would notice.

？1：By the way, who's Agravain?

Oh, that's right, our dear [%1][sr]doesn't know Agravain very well.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He may not be much compared to the glorious legends of Sir Gawain, Sir Lancelot, or Sir Percival, but...

He was King Arthur's adjutant.
[k]

＠Mash
His mother, Morgan the Enchantress, was Arthur's older sister. She cursed and neglected the king his entire life.

I see. The son of King Arthur's enemy... In other words, he was a spy, a snake in his bosom?

＠Mash
...Yes. If you look at the family tree, he's also a half-brother to the treacherous Sir Mordred.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
At the same time, he was the youngest brother of Sir Gawain, who swore allegiance to King Arthur.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Yes. But apparently Sir Gawain and Morgan never had much interaction.
[k]

＠Mash
Sir Mordred was also a child of Morgan, but he was only in her care during his childhood.
[k]

＠Mash
It may be that Morgan raised Sir Agravain as the only son she could trust.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Sir Agravain was a cold individual. Yet he succeeded King Arthur as the civil officer in charge of Camelot's government.
[k]

＠Mash
Most of the Knights of the Round Table must've hated him. They would've seen him as one of Morgan's men who might turn on them at any moment.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
But, in the end...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
He was killed by Sir Lancelot.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Lancelot had an affair with Guinevere, King Arthur's wife.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It was Agravain who denounced the two unfaithful. Agravain even accused Guinevere of being impure.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...And for that, in a fit of rage, Lancelot slew him.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
That was the beginning of the collapse of the Round Table.
[k]

＠Mash
Lancelot escorted Queen Guinevere safely from Camelot, then returned to his home country of France,
[k]

＠Mash
and King Arthur, returning from a successful Roman expedition, found himself up against a rebellion led by Sir Mordred...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...Which led to Arthur's death at Camlann. That is the conclusion of the famous Arthurian legend.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Right. In that sense, you can even say Agravain murdered King Arthur, as Morgan had planned.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Had he not revealed Queen Guinevere and Lancelot's affair, the Round Table wouldn't have fallen.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
That's right... You may say he achieved the biggest impact with the smallest gesture.

They pride themselves on glory and chivalry, but in the end, their lives were just as bitter...
