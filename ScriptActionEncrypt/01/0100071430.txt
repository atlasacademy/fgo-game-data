...I got cursed again... I guess it's useless even if I block it with magical energy at max power...

＠Ishtar
At this rate, not only will I be unable to fight, but Ereshkigal will crush me like a bug...

Looking at these other goddesses, I know I'm better! Better than all of them! But I just can't lose to this one woman.

It's a battle with a hopelessly irritating rival!

Heh. The underworld is like my backyard. I know how things work down here. I've been here numerous times.

I did accidentally die, but before the gallû spirits came, I hid in the shadows. There, I held my breath and meditated, and then... Presence Concealment EX.

＠Gilgamesh
After I got away from them, I was sitting here contemplating what to do, when you lot came! That's all!

Fool. The curse of the underworld is only for the living. I'm dead, so I needn't worry about any of that.

[charaFace D 3]
＠Gilgamesh
However, that also means that I am subject to Ereshkigal's laws as well.

＠Gilgamesh
Even if I wanted to return to Uruk, I wouldn't be able to leave the underworld without her permission.

And I don't think she'd let me leave this world so easily either. So, you know what to do, right, [%1]?
