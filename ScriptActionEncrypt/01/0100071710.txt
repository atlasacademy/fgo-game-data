All the fires that light the night are strewn together to look like a river. The survivors are forming caravans and heading for the Northern Wall.

And the soldiers are still at the walls, carrying those artillery platforms. Just as the king ordered.

Yes. I'm glad you're willing to mourn, but now's not the time yet.

It's okay. Uruk will survive this, too.

After all, they've gotten through floods and famines just fine!

Are you trying to say, “I'm the only one who's allowed to destroy Uruk!” What do you call that again?

No, I was just being silly, yes! I'm sorry, Master, Mash.

＠Quetzalcoatl
I was going to tell you not to look in the houses. But that's making light of everything you've been through so far.

＠Quetzalcoatl
None of the people of Ur survived.[sr]Everyone was killed in their homes.

The people of Ur were killed for no reason.
[k]

Not from hunger, anger, or over territory.

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jaguar Warrior
They were killed simply because someone wanted to try killing them. This never happens in nature...
