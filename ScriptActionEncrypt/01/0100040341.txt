＠Mephistopheles
This is quite...regretful![sr]This materialization was one I couldn't enjoy much of...
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
I suppose Servants need Masters after all... Yes, the[sr]power of the bond between Master and Servant...
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
Something of it...[sr]Not. Yes, definitely not.

[charaFace G 0]
＠Mephistopheles
Once a Master decides to fulfill an earnest wish, I must make at least one child must die by the Master's hand.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Mephistopheles
Otherwise you can't enjoy the best part of a Holy Grail[sr]War. Oh, I envy you, Shield Servant...
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
You will have countless chances from here onwards...[sr]to betray and throw your Master into despair!
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Mephistopheles
I am so...jealous of you!

＠Mordred
...Did you find anything?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes. I found the note the doctor left.[sr]Apparently, he was writing this when he was attacked.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
I see.[sr]I must say, he was a lax old guy until the end.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...I'll read it out loud.
[k]

＠Mash
"I learned of a certain plot. Its name is 'Project Demonic[sr]Fog.' Though its present state is still unknown,"
[k]

＠Mash
"The three leaders of the project are 'P', 'B' and 'M', who[sr]can cast spells beyond human wisdom. Probably Heroic Spirits."
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Is "M" the guy from earlier?[sr]Well, let's take this back and have Jekyll read it, too.
[k]

＠Mordred
And now...[sr]I've found something interesting, too.

＠Mash
Yes, she does have a horn...
[k]

？2：Is she human? Or a Servant?

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Who knows?[sr]It would be the best if we ask her.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Are you a human?[sr]Or are you a Servant just like us?

＠Dr. Roman
Hmm, I can't determine what she is... All I can read[sr]is that there are vital and physical reactions.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It seems the detection issues caused by the Demonic Fog[sr]can reach indoors, too. How about you, Mash?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
I can't figure it out, either.[sr]How about you, Mordred?

I can't tell for sure by just her presence.[sr]I think the Demonic Fog outside is interrupting.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
But, you're asking what she is?[sr]Of course she's a Servant[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Mordred
At least I wish I could say that.[sr]...In my memory, that's how it was supposed to be...
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
Anyway, yes.[sr]She is an artificial human. Apparently.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
An artificial human[line 3]is she?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
I found her in the coffin in the backroom,[sr]and a note was attached. Let me see...
[k]

＠Mordred
First artificial human created by Grandfather Victor[sr]Frankenstein, or something like that.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So it is Frankenstein's monster.[sr]But didn't it burn up in the end according to the novel?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I wonder if she can hear my voice.[sr]Let's see... Are you Frankenstein's monster?

I'll let you stay with Jekyll for now. Let's go. The fog[sr]shouldn't impact you if you're an artificial human.
