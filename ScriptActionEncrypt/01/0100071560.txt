...I've lost the Spirit Origin reading for both of them.

...Ana's weapon is a scythe that causes wounds that never heal. A Noble Phantasm that kills immortals.

＠Dr. Roman
Her last strike stripped Gorgon of her immortality.

？1：...This is for Ana.

But... How come I'm not getting a reading on the Grail? Gorgon should've possessed the Mage King's Holy Grail.

＠Merlin
She had the blessings of the Grail. But she didn't have the Grail itself.

＠Merlin
Which means there's only one explanation. The Mage King's Grail is[line 3]

I wasn't with her, so the Grail couldn't protect her.

If that little goddess isn't here, does that mean she sacrificed herself to slay her?

Sheesh...

So even goddesses were just part of the old world, huh? I guess they lacked the beauty to survive in the new world.

...Shut your mouth, Merlin. I am well and truly furious right now.

I've never felt something so strongly. I've exterminated humans, but only as duty required.

＠Kingu
But now, it's not duty that moves me. This is... I feel such a powerful hatred for you.

＠Kingu
I've never killed a human out of anger before. This will be a first for me.

Enkidu insisted on being a weapon until the end, never once killing out of any emotion.

And she too loved her creator. So this is all out of pity. Sympathy, I think you call it.

With Gorgon gone, her children will self-destruct.

They were created by Gorgon's powers. The weaker ones won't be able to maintain their bodies.

The battle is over. The Demonic Front has ended with your victory. But...

You'll find no joy in victory, virtuous ones who crushed a terrible Avenger.

Are you satisfied, having saved so many of your comrades? Then...you will pay the price for that by dying here.
