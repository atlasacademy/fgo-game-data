It seems we're all here. Very well. Let me give you your assignment, [%1].

＠Siduri
Today's task is from Mr. Limmat at the ranch. Apparently, he wants help shearing his sheep.

Huh? Shearing sheep... Shearing sheep!?[sr]That's such a menial chore!

＠Siduri
It isn't a menial task. Wool is priceless.[sr]It is a valuable commodity for trade.
[k]

＠Siduri
Sheep are normally shorn two or three times a year, but the shorter the cycle, the greater the profit.
[k]

＠Siduri
Mr. Limmat's main assets are his 180 sheep. If it takes four hours to shave one, he can only shave four a day at most.
[k]

＠Siduri
In other words, it would take Mr. Limmat over a month to shear all the sheep by himself.
[k]

＠Siduri
A whole month. If this could be shortened to 10 days, do you see how much of a difference in profit it would make?
[k]

？1：So it's like a shipment coming in a month late...

That analogy is really the opposite, but I see what you mean... It's the age of the fast and furious, or rather, the RAST and furriest.

I like your enthusiasm. Now then, here is your referral letter. Sheep are nice, Mash. They are very fluffy this time of year.

Oh, that's right. I forgot to mention that the ranch is on the outskirts of Uruk.

There are reports of previously undocumented Demonic Beasts roaming that area. Please be careful.
