＠Da Vinci
And so, having overcome various trials and tribulations, we finally arrive at the great temple!
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
As you can see, in preparation for tomorrow's battle, everyone is asleep, though.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Thanks for all your hard work, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
It's the same as usual, but this time I wonder if you've become a little more [&masculine:feminine]?
[k]

？1：That sounds suspicious... Something's changed?

[charaFace C 3]
＠Da Vinci
Something. We've been busy with so many things, we haven't had time to say much.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Since it's just the two of us, I thought it'd be a good opportunity to try and catch up.
[k]

？2：The same goes for you, Da Vinci.

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
Is that so? I only roamed between life and death a bit...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Even in a situation like that, maintaining a smile is what it means to be the Mona Lisa, though...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
Yes. If it has increased my appeal, I suppose it was worth it.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Well, incidentally, I did have something else.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
[%1], are you hiding something? Not from me, but from Roman.
[k]

？1：Ugh!
？2：...How do you know?

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
You made eye contact with Mash, right? You seemed surprised.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This is the territory of Egypt. The conversation between us won't reach Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
If it's all right, if there's anything wrong, I'd like for you to be able to tell me.
[k]

？1：...Actually...
？2：...Roman is...

？！

＠Da Vinci
I see...The 2004 Holy Grail War... Yes, I didn't know that either.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I was summoned to Chaldea much later. I only met the previous director very briefly.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
Near the end of that year, Marisbury died. I didn't know about the relationship between Romani and the former director.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Oh, speaking of which, a Heroic Spirit was summoned into Mash shortly before my summoning.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
At that time, Mash's condition got worse, and the former director apparently asked Romani for help.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Romani learned of Heroic Spirit possession experiments at that time, and seemed to regret his foolishness.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He had been in Chaldea for some years, but never realized that that section existed.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
Of course I was shocked, too. Then angry. I wished I had never been summoned to Chaldea.
[k]


？1：But then why did you stay in Chaldea?

？！

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
...Well, there's a chance that Heroic Spirit summoning could disappear in the future, and I had a scientific curiosity, so I couldn't turn it down.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
But the biggest reason was Romani.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I knew from one look. “Ah, this is the kind of guy who overworks himself.”
[k]

？1：Overwork himself...?
？2：Not that he had a secret?

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Romani is only human, not a mage. Just like you, he experiences various emotions when dealing with challenges.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He possesses greater than ordinary gifts, but he's not a genius to surpass other people.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That kind of person was carrying humanity on his back, and was becoming desperate.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Romani himself didn't know why he would have to do such a thing.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
He never said it, but I understood that he was at his wits' end... Because I'm a genius.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
That's why I chose to stay in Chaldea. The point is I couldn't turn my back on Romani.
[k]

？1：...Is the Doctor a bad person?
？2：...Is the Doctor a good person?

？！

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
He's neither, and he's both. I mean, that's what human beings are.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
...But Romani is holding a trump card. I will tell you that.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Just as you suspect, Romani is hiding something. That's... Well, it's like the Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
He's secretly holding onto a means to grant one wish. But he's too scared to even think about it.
[k]

？1：Why?

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
It's simple. If he uses it, he'll disappear. That's why he can't use it.
[k]

？1：...You mean, he'll die?

？！

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
[line 3]Yeah. Something like that.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
...Anyway. Dr. Roman's past is a mystery, but he doesn't have any ulterior motives. He will be your ally to the end.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That alone I'd stake my title of “genius” on. So please don't pick on Romani too much.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
As you know, his will is like tofu. If he loses confidence, it will have an effect on our chances of survival.
[k]

？1：...Yes, you're right.
？2：...Thank you, Da Vinci.

？！

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
What, I should be thanking you. It helps you're a thoughtful person.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Okay, you should sleep. Our negotiations with King Ozymandias are tomorrow.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
It's surely going to be a long day. Make sure to prepare for battle.
