Not bad! That's what I'd expect from humanity's last Master!
[k]

＠Ishtar
Forget humanity and the responsibilities of a goddess! Now I'm getting into this! I'm kicking it up a notch!

＠Gilgamesh
Ishtar may not look it, but she's the greatest of the Sumerian goddesses. As Inanna, the “Queen of Heaven”...
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
She once ruled the heavens in the god An's place.[sr]She would never lose in a battle of strength.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Gilgamesh
There's the example of Mt. Ebih, too. The more you push her, the more she'll show her guts, even if she shouldn't. That's who she is.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Gilgamesh
But she does have a weakness.[sr]...Gems.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I gather all of mankind's treasures, but she goes crazy over gems.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Gilgamesh
And this is the most important point: She lacks what's called the “Golden Rule.”
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
She loves gems, but has no luck when it comes to obtaining them. Until now, she's had gods and men offer them to her.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
But now there's nobody making offerings to her.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Gilgamesh
You know what that means, right?[sr]You can just buy her off.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
[%1], I will entrust you with thirty percent of the rare jewels in my treasury.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Negotiation is the most important skill a contractor can have. Go buy me a Goddess.

I'm not interested in some random knickknacks you picked up off the ground somewhere[line 3]

You're talking about the treasury Gilgamesh is building for the future, right?

＠Ishtar
Once completed, it's been touted to be bottomless...[sr]Or... Or that it contains ALL mankind's treasures!!!
[k]

[charaFace F 10]

And I get a huge fraction of it?[sr]That sounds too good to be true...

Even the concept of beauty itself[line 2]developed by humans and applied by you gods[line 2]will disappear. That'd be a shame.
