＠Caesar
...So you're here.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Caesar
I'm tired of waiting.[sr]How long do you intend to keep me waiting. 
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caesar
Still though, it looks like it was worth a little boredom!
[k]

＠Caesar
That beauty of yours[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Caesar
So beautiful. Beautiful. Truly beautiful, your beauty[sr]is fitting for the world's greatest treasure - Rome!
[k]

＠Caesar
Heir to our beloved Rome.[sr]What did you say your name was?

＠Caesar
Don't fall silent.[sr]Even if it's on the battlefield, be eloquent.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Caesar
Or do you intend to fight without giving me your name?[sr]Is that the way of the current Roman emperor?
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Caesar
Now then, speak. Who is the one who would[sr]force me to take up arms, what is your name?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
[line 2]Nero.[sr]I am the fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
My name is Nero Claudius.[sr]I will take you out pretender to the throne!
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Caesar
I like how you announced yourself.[sr]Otherwise it would all be so dull.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caesar
You, guest commander! Thank you for coming[sr]from a distant land. Tell me your names as well.
[k]

？1：I am [%1].

Mash Kyrielight.[sr]I'm Master [%1]'s Servant.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Caesar
I've never heard of those names. All roads[sr]lead to Rome, eh? I see that I was arrogant.
[k]

？2：...Um, you're kind of plump, aren't you?

[charaFace F 1]
＠Caesar
Of course, Rome is the pinnacle of civilization and that[sr]begins with gourmet food. Plumpness is power.
[k]

＠Caesar
Take the fifth Emperor here, she's plump in all the right places.[sr]Although inferior to my woman, the Queen of Desert, but that's fine. 
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Nero
...Mmm, as befits the mystery man who subdued Gaul...[sr]You soften a woman's heart as naturally as you breathe...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
But I am not a woman like my mother.[sr]I am an emperor and a young maiden!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
Oddly rotund man, your words fail to strike a chord in my heart!
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Caesar
Is that so...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Um, can we get down to business?
[k]

？！

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaFace A 7]
[charaFadein A 0.1 2]
＠Mash
I want to ask you something.[sr]About the United Empire, and the Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caesar
Oh? Then, um, the what's-your-name over there...
[k]

？1：It's [%1].

？！

[charaFace F 1]
＠Caesar
So you're the "Master," huh?[sr]I see, so this is Master and Servant.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Caesar
You seem very different from the one I know.[sr]Or are you the proper one?
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Caesar
In any case, I suppose you're my enemy.[sr]It's a pain, but so be it.
[k]

＠Caesar
Let me reward you for coming all this way. I will let[sr]you witness the power of my golden sword, Crocea Mors.

Don't say that! Gold is my color![sr]Mine! The one who built the Golden Theater!

[charaFace F 1]
＠Caesar
Haha, that's the spirit.[sr]Protect her well, Demi-Servant.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caesar
Fight well and perhaps I will tell you where to find the Holy Grail that you seek.
