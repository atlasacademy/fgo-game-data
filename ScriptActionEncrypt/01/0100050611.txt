...I have a favor to ask of you all.[sr]At this rate, the boy's condition isn't going to improve.

＠Nightingale
His heart should've been repaired just now, but more than 10% of it is starting to deteriorate again.

＠Nightingale
A bottomless bucket... Well, not that bad, but without continuous treatment he will die quickly.

＠Nightingale
This is completely due to my own incompetence.

However, I do not want to give up on him.[sr]I will not give up on him.

Yeah. You don't need to send me any detailed data.[sr]I can tell at a glance. It's a curse.

＠Dr. Roman
Removing the curse takes precedence over treatment.[sr]The fastest way is to defeat the person who injured him.

＠Dr. Roman
Gáe Bolg is said to be a demonic spear or technique wielded by Cú Chulainn[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In any case, there's no doubt that it was a blow that, if left untended, will destroy the heart.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's basically a miracle that Rama is still alive. Normally, I wouldn't be surprised to see him already dead...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Or rather, it's strange he's not dead.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Then again, this is Rama, hero of the Ramayana, one of India's two epic poems. If anybody can perform a miracle, it's him.

It's more accurate to say that Rama reversed his state of death through sheer willpower.

Basically, the fact that Rama is alive is an “error” in the proper cause-and-effect flow of this world.

“They're monsters born indefinitely from our queen. Even if we lose a few thousand here, it won't be a problem for us!”

As an inventor, Edison did not try to pioneer[sr]anything[line 3]

His talent lay in modifying other people's cutting-edge inventions so that they became more accessible.
