＠Da Vinci
Okay, we're ready to cross the desert. Shall we leave soon, [%1]?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The group consists of [%1], Mash, Sanzang, Touta, Sir Lancelot, and his elite followers.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
It's possible that we'll battle King Ozymandias's forces as well. Sir Lancelot and his followers will have to be in high spirits.
[k]

？1：Huh? Where is Bedivere?

？！

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
I asked him to contact the mountain people. I had him go to the eastern village a little earlier.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He already knows Hassan of the Cursed Arm, so that should be appropriate, right?

Bedivere will let Hassan know that we'll be joining forces with the Sun King, but...

Hassan is hostile towards the Sun King, so I worry about whether or not he'll accept it.

Okay, okay. I assume it'll be an awkward talk, though. If I could use the [&young man:young lady] as an excuse, it should be 50:50.

I made an oath to the king. I chose to swing this sword for him.

However, if he has lost his humanity, it is his subjects' duty to set things right.

Even if it means people will see me as a monster, now is the time to carry out my final act of loyalty.

Hey, let's not get gloomy. First we have to appeal to the Sun King.

Right, right. We have to look as strong as possible and convince him that there's no way we'll lose.
