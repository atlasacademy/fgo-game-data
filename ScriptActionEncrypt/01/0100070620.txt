We've safely reached the observatory.

＠Mash
It was smooth sailing after the statue incident. It was such a peaceful trip, Master.

...Mmm. Nothing is happening. How boring. I had such high hopes for something silly happening on this journey.
[k]

？1：The statue incident was pretty silly.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Gilgamesh
Hahaha. I'd already forgotten about that. You two forget about it as well. Stop being pests.
[k]

？2：So we just need to switch the jars?

[charaFace B 1]
＠Gilgamesh
Yes. Take these and replace them with the jars in the wagon. I'm not fit to do physical labor. So get to it.
[k]

＠Mash
King Gilgamesh stayed behind at the observatory. He said he had to check on something, but that he would be back in twenty minutes.
[k]

＠Mash
So we can take a little break until then.

＠Dr. Roman
(Sigh) If you'd only come here during your day off, you could be swimming in the sea. That's too bad.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
How does the Persian Gulf look to the naked eye? I bet it looks different from Okeanos.

＠Mash
In comparison, it looks quite a bit smaller. I mean, it's more of a port than an open sea.
[k]

＠Mash
However, the thought that the vast Indian Ocean is beyond this point is quite exciting.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I mean, in every era, humans came face to face with the vast ocean and conquered it.

You're right. Also, the scale of the Seventh Singularity is much greater than any of the previous Singularities.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We're getting observation results of the Indian Ocean, far beyond the Persian Gulf.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm pretty sure that's because in Mesopotamia the ocean is an essential factor of life itself.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]


＠Dr. Roman
I know how you feel. The Demonic Front, the forest surrounding Ur, and our search for the Grail... We have our work cut out for us.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But being impatient won't do anyone any good. You won't solve anything by charging blindly onto the battlefield. At least, not yet.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Being patient and assessing the situation is also part of the battle. Save your energy for when the time is right.

...I don't know what to say. It seems you people have a real lack of a sense of danger.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Not only are you far from Uruk, you would even come to a secluded area like this without an escort?
[k]

＠Enkidu
Either you're used to your own luck, or you greatly underestimated us...
[k]

[charaFace F 7]
＠Enkidu
Well, I suppose it doesn't matter. Either way, no one is coming to your rescue this time.
[k]

？1：Enkidu...!

＠Enkidu
Yes, that's right. I'm glad. A bit relieved, actually.

You're not the brightest out there, but at least you have the capacity to remember my name.

That again? You treat me like an impostor just because I've changed owners... Humans really are hopeless.
[k]

[charaFace F 7]
＠Enkidu
However... I suppose you're right. I am not the actual Enkidu.
[k]

＠Enkidu
I knew I had to make that clear. I mean, it'd be annoying if you started to get the wrong idea about me in the future.
[k]

＠Enkidu
I'm an enemy to humans until I'm destroyed. Whatever happens, that will never change.
[k]

[charaFace F 8]
＠Enkidu
I'll prove that by ending your lives right now. Your luck ran out the moment you came here to the port while Ishtar wasn't around to protect it.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Oh, but I won't make you suffer. I'm not so brutal as the three goddesses.
