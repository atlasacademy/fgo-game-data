I did not wish to encounter the great man who bravely confronted a nation under these circumstances, either.

However, I must raise my spear now that we're being attacked. Don't worry, I won't let the mechanized infantry interfere.

＠Geronimo
He's a Lancer. Summon Servants that are advantageous against him and unleash Noble Phantasms before he does. Got it?
