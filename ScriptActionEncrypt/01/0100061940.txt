This is not a power I control. It is but a merciless blade that cuts down all, even the weak...

To think that even you would appear on this battlefield and oppose us...

Ah... how sad.

I was only one step away from being able to burn everything to the ground. How disappointing. Ah... How sad it is.

＠Tristan
Sir Bedivere. That is a gross error. A mistake.[sr]Your mistake.
[k]

＠Tristan
Regarding Britain, our benevolent king did indeed warn against proceeding too far[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace B 6]
＠Tristan
[line 3]but he certainly did not forbid it.

＠Tristan
...You only ever had eyes for the king's glory.[sr]You do not understand his horror.

This sorrow shall never be healed. To think that I must slaughter you with these hands, with these strings...

A knight with whom I sat next to at the Round Table...[sr]A knight with whom I fought many enemies alongside...

Please, reconsider. Just thinking about such a thing, about cutting you down...

I know no sadder tale. Even I, a so-called child of sorrow, cannot bear to face it.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]
＠Tristan
As such, I have no hesitation about slaying you on the spot. Rescuing one's friend from tragedy is also friendship, after all.
