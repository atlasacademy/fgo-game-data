＠Jing Ke
I'm Assassin, Jing Ke.[sr]Like you, I'm a guest commander under Nero Claudius.

[charaFace H 4]
＠Jing Ke
I was drawn by the prospect of killing multiple[sr]"emperors," but now I'm being treated like a general.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Jing Ke
Of course...[sr]My main activities are reconnaissance and assassination.
