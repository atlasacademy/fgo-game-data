Although, after all of that we were told to leave and essentially chased out.

...Yes. Thinking back to what King Ozymandias said[line 3]

Guests are to be given hospitality. Obviously.

We people of the desert never refuse hospitality to travelers. We understand the hardships of long journeys.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Ozymandias
However, don't expect us to reach an accord so easily. You have neither the determination nor the dignity necessary.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Go and experience the cruel reality of this world. I shall give you one last opportunity after you have done so.

[charaFace F 4]
＠Ozymandias
I am the tyrant who rules this era. I'm sure you will return to take my head eventually.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
At which point, you won't be treated as guests.[sr]You'll be treated as foolish beasts who dare oppose me.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Ozymandias
Now then, I banish you from these Egyptian lands. Seek out the Holy City first. We will have words afterward.

＠Nitocris
Also, it seems the king took a liking to you. Perhaps it was [%1]'s, how can I put it, air? Or aura?
[k]

＠Nitocris
I think it's because your easygoing personality resembles that of an old friend.
[k]

[charaFace E 9]
＠Nitocris
However, that was just a one-off.[sr]Pharaoh Ozymandias is a frightening man.

You're fated to die the next time you meet.[sr]...Don't ever forget that.

I simply repaid my debt. You won't receive anything from me again, either.

Your Majesty? ...Um, do you want to ask me something?
[k]

[charaFace E 8]
＠Nitocris
...Not really. It seems I lack determination as well.[sr]Mash, are you afraid of fighting?
[k]

＠Nitocris
You fight bravely, like any Servant would, but I could tell. ...Your true nature, that is.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...That's...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Nitocris
It's okay. I could sense it's something to be proud about. Although I'm sure Pharaoh Ozymandias would rebuke it as weakness.
[k]

＠Nitocris
However, you're different from me. Despite your fear, you stand and fight, without deceiving yourself.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Nitocris
Hehe. It must be nice to have a Master and to mutually support each other.
[k]

＠Nitocris
This may be an issue considering I'm a pharaoh, but I... I feel envious, just a little.

No need, no need at all. Because it doesn't have an engine! It's basically the same as a bicycle!

Well, since it uses magical energy in place of gasoline, it can only reach speeds of 60 kilometers an hour. But never mind that!

Now then, pile in everyone![sr]No more physical activity required!
