We made it, meow! Behind this jungle's veil lies Eridu!

I can feel Kuku's death aura just twenty meters ahead!

...It's been two hours since the sun fell from its zenith. Current time on our modern clocks: 3 PM.

It seems that Quetzalcoatl has returned from her attack on Uruk...

...What a pain. Our plan was to disable Quetzalcoatl's temple before fighting her.

Now that Quetzalcoatl has returned, that throws everything off.

The irony is, in order to weaken Quetzalcoatl, we need to defeat her first.

Hmm. It's difficult for us amateurs to move through the jungle. You can't blame us for using up half a day just to get here.
[k]

＠Merlin
[%1], now you have to decide when to execute our plan.
[k]

＠Merlin
We can spend the night here and wait for Quetzalcoatl to head back to Uruk,
[k]

＠Merlin
or see if there's an opening to get into the temple. What do you think?
[k]

？1：...There's not much time left.
？2：...We can't sacrifice any more people in Uruk.

I agree with Master. Invading enemy camps will always come with risks.

I imagine that Quetzalcoatl will interfere no matter how perfectly we prepare...

What you're saying is, if she's going to interfere anyway, then it's best for us to engage the enemy first. You got guts for saying that, Mash.

You heard that, Dr. Roman. How are things on your end? Have you figured out the layout of Eridu?

＠Dr. Roman
Yes, leave it to me. Eridu is laid out much like Uruk.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I can see there's a large structure beyond the residential district. It's not as complicated as a ziggurat, but I imagine that's the temple.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If Mash carries [%1] and you all move through the residential district at full speed, you should reach the temple in less than 10 minutes.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But I'm detecting a large magical energy signal in front of the temple. That has to be Quetzalcoatl.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If we launch an assault now, we'll have to do battle with her. There's no getting around it.

Hmm? What's the problem with that?
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Mash, young girl, pompous guy, Ishtar, and the great Jaguar Warrior.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
With this many of us, we can at least hold Kuku off for a bit.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
During that time, [%1] can run up to the top of the temple and destroy the Sun Stone, right?
[k]

[se ad7]
＠Jaguar Warrior
Here. It's a spare of my unique weapon, the Death Claw. Also known as the “Fearsome Club.”
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
I thought this might happen, so last night I went on a jungle adventure while you slept, and made it.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
One good hit from this will reduce anything[line 2]even the Sun Stone[line 2]to dust! That should take Kuku's Divinity down a few notches!
[k]

？1：U-unique... (Gulp)

[charaFace A 1]
＠Jaguar Warrior
That's right! Unique! There's not another one like it.[sr]The second Fearsome Club!
[k]

？2：What a capable, beautiful woman...!

[charaFace A 3]

I know, right? There's no one better at harassing Quetzalcoatl than me!

＠Merlin
Looks like we've got our plan. So let's confirm one last time.
[k]

＠Merlin
We're going to go through this jungle and head into Eridu. With the Doctor's guidance, we can get to the temple without any problems.
[k]

＠Merlin
No matter how we hide ourselves at the temple, Quetzalcoatl will likely detect us. So we'll just hit her head-on with all we've got.
[k]

＠Merlin
The Servants will give their all to keep Quetzalcoatl busy. That'll get you two or three minutes.
[k]

＠Merlin
With those few minutes, [%1] will enter the temple alone, and destroy the symbol at the altar.
[k]

＠Merlin
Sound good? You know this whole plan is a long shot, and both Master and Servant could die, right?
[k]

？1：...It'll work.
？2：...With this team, we can pull it off.

？！

[charaFace E 1]
＠Merlin
...Well, Romani Archaman, you heard [&him:her].[sr]Any objections?

It's a dangerous plan, but it's got its merits. No matter what we do, the chance of success is low anyway.

Da Vinci has been watching and complaining this whole time, but she gave the go-ahead, too.

＠Dr. Roman
I'll sanction the operation. Leave the backup to me, [%1].
[k]

？1：All right, let's go...!

If we fight them all, it'll take all night! Break through and head towards the temple!
