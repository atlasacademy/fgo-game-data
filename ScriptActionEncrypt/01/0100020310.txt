＠Nero
Take a good look and be struck with awe! This is my[sr]city, a glorious regime that even young girls extol!
[k]

？1：It does seem incredibly vibrant!

？2：Everyone seems to be laughing!

？！

[seStop ad5 3]
＠Nero
Yes, yes, didn't I tell you?[sr]After all, this is the greatest city in the world!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
First, there was Septem Montes[line 2][sr]Such words existed like so.
[k]

＠Nero
And that's where it all started. Our glorious history[sr]began with our divine ancestors and those hills.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
And... Hey, shopkeeper, I'm taking one of these apples.
[k]

＠Shopkeeper
Welcome to my... Oh! Your Majesty! Please,[sr]take as you wish. Glory to the Emperor and Rome!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Shopkeeper, you don't have to be so stiff.[sr]Yes, yes, this is a delicious apple.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Nero
Why don't you take one too? We're returning from war,[sr]so no need to worry about bad manners.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Sweet fruit does wonders for battle fatigue.[sr]My wounds won't be healed, but my motivation will!
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Oh, no thank you.[sr]But I appreciate the gesture...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Then how about that [&man:woman] over there?[sr]They're delicious, don't be shy.
[k]

？1：Thank you.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Ah, that is a wonderful apple.
[k]

？2：I'll eat it later.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
Really? That's pretty modest of you.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Nero
Well, for me?[sr]I'm usually humble about things too, you know?
[k]

＠Nero
But I want to show off a little[line 3][sr]ahem. A-Anyway.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
(She's cute...)
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
(How cute...)
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Umu. Once again, I like you.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
Honestly, I'm unclear about what you speak of...[sr]But I can tell that you and that girl are honest people.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's a relief to hear you say that, Emperor Nero.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It might be best to think of us simply as a mage and his pupils.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Is that so? Then let us forget this[sr]confusing talk of Masters and Servants.
[k]

＠Nero
You are the mage's pupils, and the mage speaks from a distant land.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
And? You also said your goal[line 2][sr]is to aid me?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes.[sr]You aren't wrong about that.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The center of the world, and the world itself. The name[sr]of the greatest empire that rules the world is Rome.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In this era, there should be no threat to the city.[sr]The Grail's influence must be upsetting events.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If I am right, this era's singularity is probably the existence of the great Roman Empire.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
An empire that greatly influenced later generations.[sr]Stopping its destruction would fix the singularity.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Nero
...Mm, Mm Mm...
[k]

＠Nero
...S-Sorry, I don't quite understand.[sr]Please speak a bit more in my range of understanding.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
Sorry, he can be a bit too theoretical...[sr]I'll explain.

＠Mash
We seek something called the Holy Grail, a magical item with special powers.
[k]

＠Mash
It's causing a great many disturbances just by being here.
[k]

＠Mash
The odds are great that the Grail is the problem eating away at Rome now.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
...I see.[sr]This Holy Grail is damaging my Rome.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Yes. It must sound astounding to you...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
No, neither strange nor weird. This Holy Grail.[sr]It strangely... Worries me...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Never mind, a needless concern of mine.[sr]It's just a nightmare I had once.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Right. Come with me,[sr]let's talk freely in my home.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
...Wait, what?[sr]Is there something wrong at the market?
