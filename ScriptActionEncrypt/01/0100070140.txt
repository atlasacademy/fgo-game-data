＠Enkidu
Oh, that's right. As a Demi-Servant, you're able to figure out my true nature.

＠Enkidu
You must have sensed and categorized me as a foreign element created by the gods.
[k]

＠Enkidu
...I apologize for frightening you.[sr]I should have waited longer before meeting you.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Enkidu
But now is the time for battle.[sr]I cannot let you fall prey to those Demonic Beasts.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Please forgive me for being so callous.[sr]Would you allow me to fight by your side?
