Another champion who was invited to the battlefield.[sr]You should be pleased, this garden of battle is full of oppressors.

＠Dr. Roman
That being said, I suppose this proves that[sr]even in this era, stray Servants do exist.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
For some reason, unlike hostile Servants, there are also[sr]those who have free will, stand by their era, and fight.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It has been confirmed in two eras.[sr]I am sure it will be the case for all the singularities.

If we count Fuyuki, this makes the third time[line 2]
