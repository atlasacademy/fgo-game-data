You... You're from the western village, right?[sr]Even you came here, too?

Hmm. It looks like everything went well.

...Still some survivors.[sr]I'll let you guys take care of them.

＠Hundred Personas
I'm going to go steal some horses. My brain is not functioning. Ah, I want to eat some sweet fruit...
[k]

？1：It's physical work, and yet it's mentally draining for you.

[charaFace F 3]
＠Hundred Personas
That's right. I turn all of my personalities into my own blade. That's how I fight.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
That's why the longer I fight, the slower my thought process becomes. Stealing horses is about as much as I can do now.
[k]

？2：I should have brought a steamed bun.

[charaFace F 4]
＠Hundred Personas
Steamed...bun? Is that like lokum?[sr]Whatever it is, I'll take it.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
Our village is always short of food. I would love the kids to at least have something sweet to eat.
[k]

？！

...Anyway. Serenity, it's time you showed [%1] your true strength.
