All that begins must end. So, too, all that lives, dies, and in dying, value finds. Thy vaunted eternity is but hollow slumber.

Beast II's Spirit Origin pattern has changed...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I don't believe it... Not only were Tiamat's wings severed, but now she's had the concept of “death” forced onto her!

＠Dr. Roman
Tiamat is as enormous as ever, but now she has a normal Servant's Spirit Origin pattern!

You can beat her! If you act now, you can completely destroy Beast II!
