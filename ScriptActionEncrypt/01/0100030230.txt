All right, men![sr]To our two new comrades, [%1] and Mash.

Oh, but we really don't have time for this...

？1：It can't be helped.

？2：There's nothing we can do.

？！

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Please don't give in so easily! We have to set sail[sr]and check out these waters immediately...

That's not what I mean.[sr]If you're going to help, please consider our situation[line 2]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
Huh? Oh, I get it, more or less.[sr]These waters are abnormal, right?
[k]

＠Drake
I mean, I've seen superhumans walking around[sr]who won't even budge from cannon fire.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Servants!
[k]

＠Drake
Being a pirate myself, see,[sr]I've been through my share of chaos.
[k]

＠Drake
I can usually tell when it's something bad[sr]and unavoidable.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
These waters are abnormal. One moment we're in a jungle, the next we're in a temperate Mediterranean climate[line 2]
[k]

＠Drake
The currents and winds are a mess, too.[sr]I mean, even sailing straight out into the sea is tricky.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
...Moreover, there's no "continent" in this ocean.[sr]Nor is there an "England."
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
So, you already knew that much...
[k]

＠Drake
Hence why we were already planning[sr]on a new journey as soon as tomorrow.
[k]

＠Drake
Doesn't make sense for pirates to settle down on land.[sr]Gotta find a town to call our home base.
[k]

＠Drake
Tonight was supposed to be the pre-party.[sr]But, you guys showed up out of nowhere.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
I see...
[k]

？1：Sorry for interfering.

？2：Pardon us.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Don't sweat it. You guys are a good omen!
[k]

＠Drake
From what I can tell,[sr]you know how to handle a cannon or two. Right?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
I've never tried, but probably. ...Um, so if you[sr]already knew this much, why did you attack us?
[k]

＠Drake
Ahahaha![sr]Well, isn't that obvious? Because it seemed like fun!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Such a trivial reason...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
So, [%1] you say?[sr]You the[line 2]captain or something?

Something similar, I would say.

No, that's not what I mean.[sr]The Holy Grail...

Ah-ha! You got a fine pair of eyes there.[sr]Gold tankards are usually so tasteless, but not this one.
[k]

＠Drake
It's not just the never-ending booze from it, either.
[k]

＠Drake
Place it on the table, and behold![sr]It produces endless meat and fish!

＠Drake
I just happened to pick it up,[sr]but I doubt you'll find anything like this anywhere.

＠Pirate
What're you talking about, Boss? This wasn't[sr]coincidence. It was an adventure for several lifetimes!
[k]

＠Pirate
Seven endless nights![sr]Giant destructive whirlpools in one ocean after another!
[k]

＠Pirate
And from within the maelstrom,[sr]the legendary lost city of Atlantis!
[k]

＠Pirate
"The time is upon us. By the 12 gods of Olympus, I shall[sr]create another flood and destroy all civilization!"
[k]

＠Pirate
That's what the big thing said[sr]right before Boss kicked its ass and seized the treasure!
[k]

＠Pirate
And with that, as crazy as it sounds,[sr]she became a hero! She saved the world!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
Huh? Was it really that epic?[sr]It got on my nerves, so I gave it a piece of my mind.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Drake
That big lug called itself Poseidon.[sr]Can't really have that as a sailor.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
That's why I put it in check and took its treasure, see?[sr]I even sank the entire city into the whirlpool. It was great!

Bwaaaahahaha! Way to go, Boss![sr]Both fortune and misfortune smiled upon you!

You're gonna be single till the day you die![sr]Or maybe you're actually a dude or something, eh Boss?
[k]

＠Drake
Now this is fun! We've got a new crew, and the booze is[sr]tasty! But we're takin' Bombe in a barrel later, and sinkin' him!
[k]

＠Drake
Now we sing, you idiots![sr]Golden Hind, sing the crew's theme song!

Senpai, the Foundation of Humanity was on the[sr]verge of destruction in this era before we arrived!

＠Mash
And... Captain Drake, without even knowing,[sr]resolved it on a whim.

The search program is acting up a bit. For some reason,[sr]it says the Holy Grail is right in front of you.
