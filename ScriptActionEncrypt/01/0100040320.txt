＠Mordred
...Damn. They're coming again.[sr]I wish I could unleash my Noble Phantasm at will.

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
We're inside the city.[sr]I'm sorry, but you must get your temper under control.

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
I know that, Shieldy.[sr]Ugh, somehow I feel weird when you tell me that.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Hold on. "Shieldy?"[sr]Are you referring to me?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
Huh? You have a shield, don't you?[sr]You use it to defend and bash people in the face.
[k]

＠Mordred
Or, does "Ms. Shieldy" sound better?[sr]I don't care which one you pick.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
...That's okay.[sr]Just call me "Shieldy," please...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The enemy is trying to flank us from both sides.[sr]Can you take care of the right side, Saber Mordred?
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Leave it to me. I usually deal with everything by myself.
[k]

＠Mordred
Are you ready over there, [%1]?
[k]

？1：Yes, I'm ready!

？2：Strike foes from the left!

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Roger. Entering battle with hostiles!
