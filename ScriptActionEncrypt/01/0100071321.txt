...You've got some good instincts. However, I do question your character for talking to someone without looking at them.

＠Ishtar
Or does it mean you've become sensitive to my presence?
[k]

＠Ishtar
Heh. If that's it, I wouldn't mind.
[k]

＠Ishtar
That just means it's been worth teaching you proper manners when dealing with goddesses every night.
[k]

？1：Was that what we've been talking about?

[charaFace A 2]
＠Ishtar
Yes, that's what we've been doing! You were so disrespectful when we met that I was teaching you lots of things so that other goddesses wouldn't kill you!
[k]

？2：(In night mode from the get-go today, huh...)

[charaFace A 3]
＠Ishtar
...Wh-what is it? That's exactly what I'm telling you not to do.
[k]

＠Ishtar
You don't stare at someone's face in silence, whether she's a goddess or not. You need to say witty things or whisper sweet nothings.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Ishtar
...Never mind. Tonight I came to praise you.
[k]

＠Ishtar
It looks like you've befriended another new goddess. Well done. I applaud you.
[k]

＠Ishtar
It really is impressive. But for some reason, I'm miffed. Let me pinch your cheek a bit.

Ah... That made me feel better... What a strange effect. I'm going to record it thus:

＠Ishtar
“When [%1] becomes friendly with another goddess, inflicting physical pain will dispel my depression...”
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Ishtar
Anyway! You know, despite her appearance, Quetzalcoatl is the strongest within the Three Goddess Alliance.
[k]


＠Ishtar
If she went all out, she could even defeat Gorgon, who has been gaining strength as she slaughters humans.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Ishtar
But even after leaving the alliance, the law of the alliance still binds us.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Because fellow goddesses can't attack each other, the question of who is stronger is meaningless.
[k]

？1：I see.
？2：So in the end, we have to defeat them ourselves.

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Ishtar
Yes. That's why you can never let your guard down.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Quetzalcoatl's not that useful, so[line 2][flashin once 0.1 0.3 000000AF 000000FF][wt 0.4][charaFace A 5][%1]?

＠Ishtar
The jungle? Is it because of the jungle!? Is there some unknown infectious disease going around? Earth really is unclean! Dirty, filthy!
[k]

？1：It's not a cold, if that's what you mean.
？2：I'm just tired.

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Ishtar
R-really? Just how tired are you? Hmm-hmm... You haven't had any decent rest in a whole month...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Ishtar
You're taking the term hard work to the extreme![sr]Even hard labor in Kur only lasts for three days!
[k]

？1：Nah, it's like this every time.
？2：Maybe it's a little tougher than usual this time.

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Ishtar
I-I didn't know... You are investigating the Singularities, after all. I suppose that is a difficult battle for you humans.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Ishtar
...All right, then I'll take the rest of your watch. You go lie down over there.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I'll guard the entire area. I swear by the name of Irkalla, no enemies shall come near.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Ishtar
So, sleep and be at ease. Of course, you can also tell me stories about the Singularities you've encountered so far.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The night is long. I promise I won't get bored. I'll be a good listener.
[k]

？1：Well, if you're interested...
？2：Long ago in Okeanos, a rotten pirate named Blackbeard...

A pyramid from the sky! What a foolish Heroic Spirit![sr]I know the type. Just as stupid as King Gilgamesh!
[k]

＠Ishtar
That Nitocris sounds likable. A Heroic Spirit who treats ghosts well is a Heroic Spirit who appreciates the good things in life!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Ishtar
Ah... But skull-faced Heroic Spirits kind of turn me off. Wearing bones on their flesh just sounds painful...
[k]

？1：I'm glad you liked my stories.
？2：I ended up telling you about all six of them...

？！

[charaFace A 8]
＠Ishtar
I'm sorry. I ended up tiring you even more! But I enjoyed it! Thank you for sharing your experiences with me!
[k]

？1：You enjoyed it...?

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Ishtar
Yes. I'm sure it was a tough, merciless experience for you...
[k]

＠Ishtar
But all that...it's like the sort of thrilling adventure I always dreamt of. And more than anything...
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Ishtar
...each one of those Singularities ended happily![sr]You're not the only one who worked hard.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The humans in each period you visited never gave up. No matter how rough it got, they gritted their teeth and rose up.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Ishtar
Yes, just what I expect of humans! Nature, fate, the gods, and even evil itself within humanity...
[k]

＠Ishtar
Only humans can bring down all of that nonsense! They are the epitome of unlimited potential, so it is appropriate that I protect them!
[k]

？1：You like humans?
？2：You like adventure?

...It looks like the morning sun is about to rise. We'd better get some sleep. We're going back to Uruk soon, right?
[k]

＠Ishtar
The area around Uruk is overrun with Gorgon's Demonic Beasts, but I'm sure they won't be any problem for you.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Ishtar
...Although I can't vouch for what's going on within Uruk's walls...
[k]

＠Ishtar
Well, that ends our nightly chat. You're a frail human, so get your rest now.
