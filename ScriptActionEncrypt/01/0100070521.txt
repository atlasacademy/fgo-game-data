Yeah. If that many of the Eleven Offspring have shown up...
[k]

＠Merlin
Soon you'll start hearing people claiming the Goddess of Demonic Beasts is the same as Tiamat.

According to the Mesopotamian creation myth, they are the last children of Tiamat, the mother of all gods.

A goddess of creation in the world of Mesopotamia... It is said she's the mother who gave birth to all the gods.

＠Dr. Roman
Tiamat is one of the primordial gods of Mesopotamia. Or perhaps she should be considered a first-generation god.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In Mesopotamian mythology, the universe is called Anki. “An” means “heaven and god” and “Ki” means “earth and goddess.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The goddess brings forth life, and the god rules it. That's how the relationship is.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Back when what was above was not called heaven and what was beneath was not called earth,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
the god Abzu mated with the goddess Tiamat, and gave birth to many children, the gods.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But as the children grew, they desired power, and they rebelled against Tiamat to widen the world.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Tiamat was saddened and angered by her children's betrayal, and created new children.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But they were only “Ki,” incomplete creations that lacked “An.” As a result, these new children were not gods.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Instead, they were twisted, terrifying beasts... The “Eleven Offspring of Tiamat.”

＠Merlin
The seven-headed serpents known as the Mušmaḫḫū. The wicked water snakes known as the Ušumgallu.
[k]

＠Merlin
Dragon-beast Bašmu, the poison snake. Babylon's Dragon Mušḫuššu, the terrifying snake.
[k]

＠Merlin
Two-faced beast Laḫmu, the mysterious child. There's no description of its form in the books, so I can't tell you more.
[k]

＠Merlin
Giant Beast Ugallu, the giant sun. The lion-dog Uridimmu.
[k]

＠Merlin
Girtablilu the Wise, the scorpion man. Until three months ago, it was the commander of the Demonic Beasts.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Merlin
Tomoe Gozen sacrificed herself to slay Girtablilu. It's thanks to her that our battle lines still hold.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Merlin
Evil spirits Umū Dabrūtu, the fierce storm. The winged mermaid Kulullû.
[k]

＠Merlin
Lastly, Minotaur Kusarikku, the sun-follower. ...Hmm, is that all of them?
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Merlin
In the Mesopotamian creation mythos, these creatures fought the gods alongside Tiamat.
[k]

＠Merlin
They were commanded by the god Kingu, the one chosen by Tiamat.
[k]

＠Merlin
But the army of the gods, with the help of the new god Marduk, were so powerful they defeated Kingu.
[k]

＠Merlin
Tiamat bit hard into Marduk, but he defeated her with a final strike from his bow.
[k]

＠Merlin
Tiamat lay there, defeated, and the gods ripped her body apart, turning it into a land that floats on the sea.
[k]

＠Merlin
That was the land of Mesopotamia, a world created from the body of the fallen deity.

＠Dr. Roman
Well, it's a pretty typical creation myth.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The body of the Earth Mother is used as soil to create the world. It is a theme seen in other mythologies too.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
A goddess creates life. But when she turns to chaos, she becomes the enemy of humanity, the mother of Demonic Beasts.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's an Authority called Potnia Theron, the “Womb of a Hundred Beasts.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Anyone with this Authority possesses the seed of life... They can make an infinite amount of monsters, provided they have the resources.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Based on the number of Demonic Beasts, the goddess to the north likely has this Authority.
[k]

＠Merlin
Yeah. And as a result, the people of Uruk see the Goddess of Demonic Beasts as Tiamat, and fear her.
[k]

＠Merlin
Well, it makes sense. The offspring of Tiamat are actually all here.

＠Dr. Roman
...Hmm. Regardless of her True Name, her Authority and the sheer number of her forces make her the greatest threat.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I wonder if King Gilgamesh has some kind of plan...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If the enemy really is Tiamat, if we just keep defending, we'll eventually be overwhelmed.
[k]

＠Merlin
Well, that's a problem for later. For now, we need to focus on the south, not the north, Roman.
[k]

＠Merlin
Once we cross the Euphrates, we'll be at Ur.[sr][%1], are you ready?
[k]

＠Merlin
Make sure you're well prepared. If we're unlucky, you'll be forced to fight the second goddess.
