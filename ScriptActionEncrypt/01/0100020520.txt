＠Nero
You handled those veterans like they were nobodies.[sr]With such small numbers, too.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Was that thanks to Mash's skills?[sr]Or was it[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Or was it [%1]'s leadership? Either[sr]way, you're more intriguing than when we first met.
[k]

＠Nero
Listen... Rather than a guest commander, want to serve me?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
You'll get to savor all the glory of this world by my side.[sr]I mean after we've defeated the United Empire, of course.

＠Nero
Well? Not a bad deal, is it?
[k]

？1：True...

＠Nero
Isn't that right? Isn't that right? You're an honest soul.[sr]Heh, heh, I think I really like you now!
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Senpai, we have a mission.[sr]You haven't forgotten, have you?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...You haven't forgotten, have you?
[k]

？2：Please let me think about it.

＠Nero
Can't answer right away even though you want to?[sr]How modest! Very well, think it over!
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Once we defeat the United Empire, I can even grant you Britannia, let alone Gaul.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
You know of my generosity, but grand feasts like this have been rare.
[k]

＠Nero
Isn't that right, soldier?[sr]Do I not excel in splendor among past emperors?

＠Roman Soldier
Yes, as you say. Today the brilliance[sr]that is Rome shines all the brighter!
[k]

＠Nero
Heh, heh, an honest fellow. Yes, yes,[sr]I believe that even I may shine a bit too brightly.

＠Mash
What is it, Doctor?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
No, it's nothing. Nothing. Whoops! Another[sr]enemy attack! More regular soldiers, this time.
