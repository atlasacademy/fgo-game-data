Her love truly was real. And in the end, it was what saved the surface world...

Speaking of laws, Mesopotamian civilization is built on the Code of Ur-Nammu and the Code of Hammurabi.
[k]

＠Mash
The Code of Ur-Nammu was created between this era and the 3rd Dynasty of Ur.
[k]

＠Mash
It's said that it consolidated all the nebulous rules into one code, which became humanity's oldest structured law.
[k]

？1：I see. Mash, you're really well-informed.

We have been walking and eating around the city, but what about outside of Uruk?
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Neither Benkei nor I are very knowledgeable about it, but we could at least tell you about the rumors.

[charaFace C 3]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Uh... Me? That's a difficult one to answer when asked so bluntly.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Ushiwakamaru
As you can see, I am a Japanese warrior.[sr]That said, the story of my birth is fairly complicated.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Born in the Heian period, raised in a temple, and trained by a tengu on Mt. Kurama. So I'm ignorant of the world.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Ushiwakamaru
I'm a skilled swordswoman.[sr]That's all. Nothing else suited me.

[charaFace C 4]

I was nothing more than my big brother's blade, or perhaps nothing else interested me...

If you were to summon me as a Minamoto[line 2]that is, when I had a position[line 2]I would probably appear different.

＠Ushiwakamaru
She is a cold-blooded warrior who brought death upon many compatriots, and never corrected her foolishness until the very end.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Ushiwakamaru
That's why I'm happy as “Ushiwakamaru.” The person I am now is able to accept everything without protest.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Not having that position is what lets me be in such good spirits and talk with you like this, Lord [%1].

＠Ushiwakamaru
With that in mind, this fleeting life is precious to me.

If so, talk to this humble servant in secret later on. After all, I, Musashibou Benkei, am Ushiwakamaru's best retainer.
[k]

＠Benkei
We are inseparable as master and servant.[sr]We are like childhood best friends.

＠Benkei
I can tell you everything about Ushiwakamaru's matter-of-fact heroic exploits and adventures.

Oh, I will smash that decoration (read: him) one day, so please ignore him.

I'm using him as a shield against arrows, but so far the chance hasn't presented itself.

＠Benkei
Hahaha, you are too harsh with me.[sr]This humble servant's position has become tenuous.

＠Ushiwakamaru
Needless to say, the Three Goddess Alliance is a major threat to Uruk.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
The Demonic Front up north. The jungle in the south. And the aerial attacks from Ishtar in the northeast mountains.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Currently, the city of Uruk is under three separate attacks from these directions.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Leonidas is keeping the Demonic Front to the north in check, but there are no countermeasures for the other two problems.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
The goddess Ishtar possesses a bow called the Boat of Heaven. As the name implies, it's a divine vessel that can soar through the sky.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
She does not have the overwhelming force of the Demonic Front, but she is still a nuisance.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Ushiwakamaru
She's like an unpredictable storm.

It did indeed look like it contained vast magical energy.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Whether it be goddess, Heroic Spirit, or human, anyone who uses that Grail could easily become king.

＠Ushiwakamaru
Do you suppose the goddesses are after the Greater Grail to re-create this world in their own image after they destroy Uruk?

？1：The Greater Grail of Uruk is not this era's Holy Grail?

？！

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what it means.

＠Dr. Roman
From the beginning, King Gilgamesh possessed a treasure worthy of being called a Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We mistakenly thought that was the King of Mages' Holy Grail.

＠Dr. Roman
Gilgamesh and Merlin both realized that, but didn't point it out.

[communicationCharaFace 4]

...Which is vexing.

＠Dr. Roman
Merlin is rotten to the core, so I'm sure we could never get a straight answer from him.

It's possible the Holy Grail was used to summon the goddesses...
[k]

？2：Maybe the three goddesses have it...?
[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
That would be a real pain... They're powerful opponents already, but if they also had the Holy Grail, we would be no match for them...
