Could someone please pour some water on me.[sr]This is bad. It's awful. I think I'm really going to lose it.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
It's so funny I might die from laughing!
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Take a look Gilles! Look at that pathetic girl![sr]What is she a wimp? A mouse? A worm?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
Either way, they're all the same![sr]So puny, I can't even muster any sympathy!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
Ah... truly[line 3]a country that could only cling to "me"[sr]...comparing them to mice is an insult to mice.
[k]

Hey, Gilles, don't you think so[line 3][sr]Oh, I see. We didn't bring Gilles along.

You... Who are you?
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
I could ask the same of you...[sr]Right, as a leader, let me answer that.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
I am Jeanne d'Arc. The saint devoted to France...[sr]the other "me."
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.1]
[charaFace D 2]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠Jeanne
What? That's nonsense.[sr]You are no saint. Just as I am no saint.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
But, that is already a thing of the past.[sr]More importantly[line 3]Why did you attack this town?
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaFace E 0]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
...Why, you ask? As the same Jeanne d'Arc,[sr]I thought you would understand.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Are you stupid now that your alignment has changed?[sr]The reason I attacked this city?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
What a foolish question.[sr]It's obvious, isn't it?
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Jeanne Alter
It is for the sole purpose of destroying France.[sr]I am, after all, a Servant.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Politically, economically, these methods take too long.[sr]Is it not better to simply physically crush everything?
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.5]
[charaFace D 2]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠Jeanne
Such foolishness!
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaFace E 0]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
"Such foolishness?"[sr]The foolish ones are us, Jeanne d'Arc.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Why did you want to save this country?[sr]Why did you want to bring salvation to these people?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Jeanne Alter
All the while knowing that they are the ones who spit on and betrayed us!
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.1]

＠Jeanne
That is[line 2]
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaFace E 4]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
I will be fooled no longer. I will be betrayed no longer.[sr]I no longer hear the voice of the Lord.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
The fact that I cannot hear His voice, means the Lord no longer blesses this country.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
So, I will destroy it, in accordance to the Lord's grief.[sr]I will cut away all the bad seeds at the roots.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
As long as the human race exists, so will my hatred.[sr]I will remake this France into a land of the dead.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
That's how I will save this country. By the hands[sr]of the new Jeanne d'Arc, reborn through death.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
I suppose you could never understand.[sr]Always playing the saint.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Jeanne Alter
Impossible for a pretty little holy virgin who pretends not to see hatred and joy and is incapable of human growth!
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.1]
[charaFace D 3]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠Jeanne
I...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
No, what is human growth to Servants? If you're going[sr]to call it something, you would rank up as a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaFace E 4]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
[line 3]There appears to be a noisy fly here.[sr]Should I kill it if it's gets too annoying?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Wait, wha-, the console's on fire![sr]That Servant can burn her enemies with just a glare!?

[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
...I have played my part for you so clearly, yet you still have doubts?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
This rage is an ugly justice. It's not that you cannot[sr]understand it, you do not even have the will to try.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
But, I understand. Seeing you, I have realized[sr]all there is to the Heroic Spirit that is myself.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
You are neither Ruler nor Jeanne d'Arc. You are[sr]nothing but some leftover residue that I threw away.

If you were the same existence and Class as I, then I should have felt something.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
But you are worthless. Nothing but a ghost[sr]with a misguided effort to recreate history.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Berserk Lancer, Berserk Assassin.[sr]Finish off that country girl.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Jeanne Alter
You're getting tired of small prey, aren't you?[sr]Rejoice, they are strong.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
Among all the Servants I summoned, your thirst for blood is the strongest.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
You exist to crush the brave.[sr]Devour them to your heart's content.

＠Berserk Lancer
[line 3]Very well.[sr]Now, I will have your blood.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Berserk Assassin
Not so fast "my King." I would like to partake of[sr]her flesh and blood, as well as her insides.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Berserk Lancer
So greedy.[sr]And her soul? Who gets to take her soul?
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Berserk Assassin
There is no gain in taking her soul. Do you think honor or reputation can maintain my beauty?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Berserk Lancer
Very well. Then I shall take her soul.[sr]It's quite ironic though.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Berserk Lancer
I am able to understand her beauty, only after I have fallen as a blood-sucking devil.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Berserk Assassin
Yes. That is precisely why I cannot hold back my emotions.
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Berserk Assassin
I will not forgive anything more beautiful than me.[sr]No, more than that[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Berserk Assassin
The blood of those more beautiful than me, can only elevate my beauty!
[k]

＠Berserk Assassin
Ah, how fun it is to crush such fresh fruit.[sr]I'll throw away the skin and just enjoy the juice[line 3]
[k]

This is the privilege of being a Noble of the Night.[sr]I'll squeeze every last drop out of you.
