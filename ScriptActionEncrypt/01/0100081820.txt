We underestimated the Heroic Spirits.

Even though we do not disappear, to be defeated in battle over and over is not what we expected.

Ah! Confirming a figure on the throne... It's the King of Mages, Solomon!

＠Solomon
Kings are usually pleased to show hospitality to guests from faraway places. I, unfortunately, hate humans.
[k]

＠Solomon
I will give you neither a reward for your long journey, nor goodwill.

＠Solomon
All I have for you is fury and the question, “Why?”

＠Solomon
Why have you come here? Why couldn't you have restrained yourselves for just a few more minutes?

＠Solomon
We were putting the finishing touches on the Virtual First Noble Phantasm, “Ars Nova.” Why must you appear before the startup calculation was complete?

...The name of one part of “The Lesser Key of King Solomon,” a grimoire that was discovered in the 19th century.
[k]

＠Mash
The book consists of five parts, of which the most famous is the “Goetia,” a catalog of Demon Gods.
[k]

＠Mash
It concludes with the “Ars Nova,” a spell that indicates “out with the old and in with the new.”

That is correct. I have three Noble Phantasms. The Virtual First Noble Phantasm just needs a matter of minutes to mature.
[k]


＠Solomon
The second Noble Phantasm is this space itself. “The Time of Coronation Hath Come, I Am the Beginning of Eternity: Ars Paulina.”
[k]

＠Solomon
In other words, my Reality Marble, Solomon's Grand Temple of Time. A workshop of void space, outside of physical reality and isolated from time.

[k]

＠Mash
Then the Third Noble Phantasm you mentioned must be the bands of light.
[k]

＠Mash
According to Chaldea's measurements, the energy it would take to exceed the bands of light doesn't exist on Earth.
[k]

＠Mash
That's what scorched the entire Earth, ended the human race, and incinerated humanity[line 3]

Of course not. Do not tell me Chaldea's commander can be so blind.
[k]

＠Solomon
It is true that these bands of light could burn the outer layer of this planet.
[k]

＠Solomon
But how would I benefit from that? Why do you think I would have gone to the trouble of incinerating you lot?
[k]

＠Solomon
You have it backwards, Mash.
[k]

＠Solomon
Unfortunately, an energy source exceeding the bands of light doesn't exist on Earth?
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Solomon
Hahahahahaha! Fool, that's exactly right!
[k]

＠Solomon
Because it is made of you people! The bands of light are made up of all of the energy gathered from Earth!
[k]

＠Solomon
By destroying the Foundation of Humanity and reducing the strength of human history to zero, our gaze can then set fire to all.
[k]

＠Solomon
Flames will engulf the surface, burn all life and civilization, and finally be extracted as residual Spiritrons.
[k]

＠Solomon
After all, there's only one Earth. The amount of heat obtained upon burning it doesn't amount to much.
[k]

＠Solomon
But it's different with the planet's inhabitants. No matter how many of you I killed, you continued to prosper.
[k]

＠Solomon
I made the Singularities, fractured history, and cut the connection between what came before and what followed after!
[k]

＠Solomon
Reaching from the present into the past, I was able to wring out nearly limitless energy!
[k]

＠Solomon
The bands of light unify all of that.[sr]The heat you looked upon was this planet's passion.
[k]

＠Solomon
It is the vestiges of the people of each era, the consolidation of everything, the very crystallization of human history!

It's just as Mr. Holmes speculated.[sr]But then what will you use that energy for?

We have no faith in you.

＠Solomon
If no one is going to achieve it, then I will.[sr]If no one can conquer death, then I will.
[k]

＠Solomon
And you will die miserably! Cling to your insignificant lives for the brief moments remaining before my great task is complete!
[k]

？1：Just who are you, Solomon...!?
？2：Reveal your true identity...!

？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Solomon
Haha...Hahahahahahahahaha![sr]I am Solomon! Or at least, this body is!
[k]

＠Solomon
But let that be the end of our entertaining conversation. It is time to commence our thrilling massacre!
[k]

＠Solomon
The Heroic Spirits' resistance means little.
[k]

＠Solomon
Granted, as long as the Throne exists, they pose an inexhaustible threat.
[k]

＠Solomon
But in the end, they are mere Servants.[sr]If I kill their Master, it is all over.
[k]

＠Solomon
You are the anchor for these Heroic Spirits.[sr]If you perish, every single one of them will leave.
[k]

＠Solomon
Honestly, what could be easier? Truly, you should have just enjoyed humanity's final year.
[k]

＠Solomon
All of your actions have been for nothing, [%1]. Oh, the worst Master of the human race.
[k]

＠Solomon
The payoff begins now. Burn to ashes like trash.[sr]The human race will perish with you.
