That took care of them all.[sr]Let's head to Uruk now, for real.
[k]

＠Merlin
[%1], it's your duty to explain Chaldea's mission to the king of Uruk.
[k]

＠Merlin
When you meet the king, it should become clear what you are meant to do. Oh! Also, Uruk would be ideal as a temporary HQ.

[k]

？1：I want to see the king ASAP.
？2：I want to set up a summoning circle ASAP.

Then it's settled. We'll go back to Uruk, but what about you, Ana? Will you come with us?

＠Merlin
Don't get so angry. I said I would lead you to the temple, but you understand the current circumstances, don't you?
[k]

＠Merlin
We can't enter that temple alone.[sr]For now, slow and steady wins the race.

＠Ana
...There's no need to shake on it.[sr]And no need to be so polite. Just keep away from me.
[k]

＠Ana
...All right, fine. For now, I'll leave the forest.
