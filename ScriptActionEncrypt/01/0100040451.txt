...All bark and no bite.[sr]I was expecting at least a reproduction of Wonderland.
[k]

＠Andersen
I guess that was expecting too much.[sr]It didn't help that we were too powerful.

...Hey.[sr]What was that about us being too powerful, punk?

Not only did you stand there like a damn statue,[sr]I think all you ever did was run your mouth and insult us!

P-Please, let's stop it, Mordred.

He has a sharp tongue for sure, but we were able to[sr]defeat the Magical Tome[line 3]Nursery Rhyme thanks to him!

Tch... You're right. I know.[sr]It's my loss if I meddle with people of this sort.

What, contrary to your looks... Wait, maybe you do have[sr]that look... Wait, maybe not after all. Your soul is like a Morning Star!
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
Morning Star, like a flail? So I'm thorny, huh?[sr]Dammit! I hate to admit it but you make a good point!
[k]

＠Andersen
...Good reaction... With training, you might be easy prey...[sr]Excuse me, a good reader. What a waste.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
But to think I'd be defended from a hater by an avid[sr]reader. Humans never change regardless of era.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

Both Mash and I are Servants.

Yes. But I was originally a human...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
More like,[sr]most Servants were originally humans.
[k]

＠Mordred
...Tch. Oh well.[sr]That thing didn't seem like it used to be human, though.

＠Andersen
Right, most of Heroic Spirits were humans,[sr]but sometimes there are cases like Nursery Rhyme.
[k]

＠Andersen
Cases where a human creation gains its own will, or[sr]gathers visions from people to become a "Conceptual Heroic Spirit."
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Those are rare, though. Someday, there might[sr]even be Heroic Spirits of machines as well as books.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Anyway, thank you for all your work.[sr]Go back to Jekyll's apartment for now.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Andersen, can you come, too?[sr]It's most reassuring to have more Servants as allies.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
What?![sr]We're taking this punk with us?
[k]

＠Mordred
He's super weak. I'm sure he'll be useless! He's so[sr]boring, too! I'm sure he won't write any decent books!
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
[line 3]I see. Okay, I'm happy to go with you.
[k]

＠Andersen
I had no intention of helping you,[sr]but that last statement changed my mind.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
My pleasure, Saber. No, Sir Mordred. By the way, if you[sr]are to be a protagonist, what's your favorite genre?
[k]

＠Andersen
A tragedy? A farce? Or a comedy?[sr]Splendid. I'll polish it into the best trashy tale ever.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
I see. Why don't you go write some unpopular books[sr]and cry in a corner, fairy tale author.

I wanted him to hear it.[sr]Only a coward talks behind one's back.

Well, let's move. Let's leave before[sr]the antique bookshop's owner wakes up.
[k]

＠Andersen
Because I'm also a thief.[sr]Actually, I snuck in from the back door.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
It'd be awkward if he woke up and called the cops.[sr]Getting arrested despite helping is going too far for a trashy book!
