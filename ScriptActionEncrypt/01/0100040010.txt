Good morning, Senpai.[sr]...You're looking quite pale today.

You couldn't sleep at all? That's no good,[sr]you must get plenty of rest while you're in Chaldea.

Rest is also an important part of our mission.[sr]Like I told you before, we are[line 2]

Senpai?

Perhaps...[sr]You had...a dream?

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...So you did have a dream.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
What kind of dream was it?[sr]It's just a guess, but...could it be my... Um...

Observing the era of King Solomon, where a summoning[sr]spell called the 72 Demon Gods was used, right?
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
That's right. Let me start with the result...[sr]There was nothing wrong with King Solomon's era.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Singularities could not be observed around the 10th[sr]century BC. Basically what that means is...

Unfortunately, as Romani says, those who called[sr]themselves the 72 Demon Gods had nothing to do with King Solomon.
[k]

？1：Why is that?

＠Da Vinci
Oh, how do I put it... Think of it like a mystery novel,[sr]one where the suspect's alibi stands.
[k]

？2：Good morning, Da Vinci.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Da Vinci
Hey, good morning! Someone that can actually greet[sr]people! [%1], you're a fine Master!

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 3]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Dr. Roman
If King Solomon had used the 72 Demon Gods,[sr]we definitely would have detected it.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Or at least seen signs that he released his 72 Demon[sr]Gods toward the future from 10th Century B.C.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
But there was nothing unusual during King Solomon's[sr]time. Which means his era remains part of correct human history.

Therefore[line 3]

Lev Lainur and those calling themselves Demon Gods[sr]appeared from a completely different era.

So, King Solomon has nothing to do with them.[sr]Well, of course[line 3]

...That's not the case if King Solomon had been[sr]serving someone else as a Servant, right?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Correct. Like [%1],[sr]one can simply use Solomon as a familiar in his own era.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That way, one could also control the "72 Demon Gods."
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 4]

＠Dr. Roman
Sigh. Using the 72 Demon Gods as familiars...[sr]But that's assuming those things really existed.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Besides, I don't think King Solomon is[sr]the kind of person that would aid such evil.
[k]

？1：Even if he was so in life...

？2：Servants obey their Masters...

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Forgive me, Doctor.[sr]But it's a Servant's nature to obey their Master.
[k]

＠Mash
As long as it's the Master's command, then King[sr]Solomon would have no choice but to obey, right?
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Such a villain couldn't summon Solomon.[sr]It's not like the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Chaldea's Summoning System comes into effect only if[sr]the Master and Heroic Spirit both agree to it.

Oh, you do have a point.[sr]I came to Chaldea because I agreed to.

＠Da Vinci
The director back then was a fine mage.[sr]I agreed to the contract because I could trust them.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Da Vinci
I told you before, didn't I? I'm Chaldea's third[sr]successful summon. It's definitely worth noting!
[k]

？1：So you're Servant No. 3?

？2：Who was the first?

？！

＠Da Vinci
No. 2 is right in front of you. It's Mash.[sr]As for No. 1, no one knows at this point.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
No. 1 and No. 2 are treated as confidential matters.[sr]Only the previous director knew the details.

Director Marie didn't even know about No. 1, either.[sr]The previous director kept all of No. 1's data under wraps.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Now that I think about it, perhaps the previous[sr]director's death wasn't an accident, but a murder.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
It's likely that Lev disliked the successful No. 1[line 3][sr]No, the Heroic Spirit Summoning System itself, so much so that he killed the previous director.

＠Da Vinci
Oh, but I think No. 1 ended in failure. Since even[sr]Mash's Heroic Spirit No. 2 ended as an incomplete summon.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
For Chaldea, completely successful[sr]Heroic Spirit summons started with me, No. 3.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Da Vinci
Also, No. 1's existence itself is suspicious.[sr]I think No. 1 may have been summoned by accident.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That's because Fate, the Heroic Spirit Summoning[sr]System's foundation, was at long last proven with No. 2's help and[line 3]

...Now, in any case, for the remaining four Singularities...[sr]It's possible the mastermind lurks in one of these eras.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
After all, there are no abnormalities in any other era.[sr]If we crush each Singularity, we'll find the culprit.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Now let me explain the details of our Order this time.[sr]The Fourth Singularity is in the 19th century[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Of the seven, it's the Singularity closest to modern times.[sr]But no need to be surprised.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This is a time when civilizations rise and flourish.[sr]In this era, mankind makes huge strides.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
[line 2]In other words, the Industrial Revolution![sr]It's a definitive turning point in mankind's history.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even from the standpoint of a consumer society,[sr]this is when mankind makes a huge leap towards modern times.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Your specific destination[sr]will be the dazzling, lavish British Empire.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Surprisingly, it's specific to the capital, London.[sr]This differs from the widespread approach of the other Singularities.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Maybe this time, you won't have to walk yourselves to[sr]death. After all, there are carriages and trains.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
That is, of course, if you can manage to use them.[sr]Since some abnormalities have been detected...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Soon, the Singularity that is 19th century London will be[sr]incinerated. It will vanish. You must stop it.

＠Dr. Roman
Find the Holy Grail,[sr]and correct the Fourth Singularity.
