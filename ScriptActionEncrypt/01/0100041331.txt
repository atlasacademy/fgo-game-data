＠Nikola Tesla
I would never truly wish for humanity's end. The Heroic[sr]Spirits of Heaven and Earth are still a nuisance[line 3]

＠Nikola Tesla
But continuation of the world means continuation of my[sr]lightning civilization! Thank you, you who desire new myths!

Sheesh, he said whatever[sr]and did whatever he pleased until the very end.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I've confirmed Nikola Tesla's annihilation.[sr]Good work. That should take care of things.
[k]

＠Mash
What we're standing on was formed by his magical energy,[sr]so it should become unstable shortly.
[k]

＠Mash
It's a very powerful effect, so it shouldn't[sr]disappear immediately...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
First we need to get safely back to the ground.[sr]This should take care of London's problems[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Oh. Right. Crap.
[k]

＠Mordred
Hmm?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
What is it, Doctor?
[k]

？1：I think we forgot something.

？2：...What about the Holy Grail?

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Oh[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah. We forgot to get the Holy Grail from Angrboda.[sr]N-No, it's not our fault. We were in a hurry. Yeah!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
You can take your time getting it.[sr]The only enemies left are wimps.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
Yeah, that's right.[sr]I don't know how I feel about going back underground.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
Let's go get it now, then.[sr]There's no sense going back to Jekyll's apartment.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
[line 3]Wait.[sr]Looks like something's showed up after all. What is it?

＠Dr. Roman
A high-density magical energy response?[sr]It's so big I can see it in the Demonic Fog... What the...
[k]


＠Dr. Roman
It's different from Nikola Tesla's response,[sr]but the fog is gathering above Buckingham palace!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Something real bad is coming![sr]Be careful, Mash, [%1]!
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
It doesn't matter what comes![sr]I'll hack them all apart!

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
[line 3]Bring it!
