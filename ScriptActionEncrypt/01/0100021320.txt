＠Boudica
...I see, the founding ruler.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Boudica
So that's why she's acting like that.[sr]Such a gloomy face is sure to affect the troops' morale.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
Emperor Nero?[sr]She doesn't look so gloomy.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Jing Ke
Even as we speak, she's encouraging the troops on the[sr]battlefield. I'm sure there's no problem.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
[charaFace H 0]
＠Boudica
Well, she is acting cheerfully.[sr]But she's not as radiant as normal.
[k]

＠Boudica
Well, right now we're fighting human soldiers, and the[sr]boss is hiding in the palace. It should be fine, but...
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Boudica
If that big one shows up again, we'll have a problem.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Boudica
The morale of the United Empire troops is strangely[sr]high. The soldiers were all ready to sacrifice themselves.
[k]

＠Boudica
More so, each capital civilian is acting like a soldier, and attacking our troops whenever in sight.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Boudica
I am sure this is the charisma of that Holy Progenitor.[sr]The soldiers and people are acting like moths drawn to the flame.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Jing Ke
It's true they seem to be acting that way.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
People of the United Empire are blind. Though that[sr]may be proof that they're under proper leadership.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Jing Ke
However, our troops have high morale as well.[sr]Nero...is acting no different than usual.

＠Mash
I'm...not sure about that.
[k]

＠Mash
I understand a little bit. It's her determination,[sr]or just general aura about her...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
It feels...[sr]a little bit lacking right now.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I'm sure it came as a shock for her. The founder of[sr]the nation, King Romulus, is actually the enemy leader...
[k]

？1：Romulus?

？2：I thought he was some mythological figure...

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Yes, the founding-king, Romulus. The great hero[sr]who founded Rome upon the Septem Montes.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
A great figure that deserves to be called the Progenitor[sr]of Rome. At any rate, he's the son of the War God Mars.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So that means his Divinity level is quite high,[sr]since Mars is the equivalent of Ares the Greek God of War[line 2]
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Sorry, I'll get back on track.[sr]Either way...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
It doesn't matter if he existed in history or not.[sr]Just like I've explained before, Heroic Spirits are the heroes people dreamt of.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In other words, Emperor Nero must have dreamt of Romulus, as well.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
A dream of the shining hero who created Rome.[sr]I'm sure it was quite a shock when that person turned out to be an enemy.

Then I will protect the soldiers and the Emperor.[sr]Mash, [%1], can I leave this to you?
[k]

？1：Sure.

Thanks, I'm going to go save our silly emperor.
