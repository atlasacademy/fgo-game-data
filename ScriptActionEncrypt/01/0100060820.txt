That's just a type of vehicle. We're playing with Rushd to try and cheer him up.

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
The child we saved back at the Holy City.[sr]He finally woke up a short while ago.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
However, he was quick to notice that his mother isn't here.
[k]

＠Mash
The others told him she went with a different group, so we've been able to dodge the issue, but...

We've been through a lot of fierce battles up to this point.

＠Dr. Roman
This is the sixth trip for [%1] and Mash, after all.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Looking back, they've visited a lot of different worlds. Isn't that right, [%1]?
[k]

？1：We've conquered land and sea.
？2：Crossing the American continent was rough...

？！

[charaFace E 3]
＠Bedivere
What? You have done so much!? I was confident of my own travels, but the sea was...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
The Knights of the Round Table were based in Britain. You didn't have reason to cross the sea.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And the era of King Arthur was a time of civil war and ethnic strife. It wasn't really a time for making journeys.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Oh, right. Uh, Sir Bedivere?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
About that arm of yours... Is that really Airgetlám?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Bedivere
I would hesitate to call it real.[sr]This is an artificial arm given to me by Merlin.
[k]

＠Bedivere
It was a plan he devised. He told me that I would have a difficult time facing the Round Table, seeing as I only had one arm...
[k]

＠Bedivere
So this is an artificial Noble Phantasm of his creation.[sr]A replica of the silver arm used by the Celtic war god Nuadha.
[k]

＠Bedivere
My body can't handle it for long periods of time...[sr]Only short bursts, like you saw.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Hm... That technology is amazing. I wonder what kind of raw materials Merlin used to replicate the arm of a Divine Spirit.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
I bet even Da Vinci's pride is hurt, deep down.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I can already imagine her flying into a rage and yelling, “My gauntlet is way better!” Well, it would just be talk though!
[k]

？1：That's true.
？2：I could have sworn she already said that...

Hahaha. No way, even you couldn't best Airgetlám.[sr]This is Merlin we're talking about. THE Merlin.

＠Dr. Roman
He's the scummiest of scummy mages that would do anything to win, you know?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
With your fixation on beauty, there's no way to beat him.

I would win, and win beautifully. In fact, if I don't, we can't beat the Knights of the Round Table!

？1：???

？！

Huh? Oh... I let my tongue slip because of you, Romani.

I didn't want to worry you, but too late now.[sr]Let me do a little explanation!

＠Da Vinci
Remember what Sir Gawain said?[sr]That he had a “Gift” from the king?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
That's a blessing from the Holy Grail. But I don't mean the Art Graph Grails we're collecting.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I mean the Holy Grail of the Savior, from Arthurian legends. The Knights of the Round Table are blessed by God.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
Oh, right. You're an exception, Bedivere. To be exact, we're talking about the Knights of the Round Table under the Lion King.

＠Bedivere
In terms of divinity, my Airgetlám is about on par...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Bedivere
Without the ability to “sever the Holy Grail,” that Gift cannot be broken.

Only Bedivere would be able to fight them.[sr]But he would reach his limit quickly.

Isn't that right, Sir Bedivere? How many times can you still fight? Once? Twice?

[k]

＠Da Vinci
We need to prepare countermeasures against the Round Table, just in case. For that, I'd like to settle down somewhere ASAP.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If I have a workshop, I can analyze their Gift.[sr]But before that[line 3]
