The way he only shows his stuff as a hero when he's under a ton of pressure... Yep, it's just like my dumb little brother!

Their looks and personalities are completely different, though. Anyway, let's try not to let the bond we forged slip away!

[charaFace H 5]
＠Medea Lily
Yes, let's go. We'll support you, Heracles!

[charaFace H 2]
＠Medea Lily
I, Medea, will support and strengthen you with everything I have. Show them the power of the famous hero of myth!

Aah, dammit. I'm going to die for nothing again, I bet!

I was just saying that you did the right thing. The best thing you can do here is to let Heracles fight to his fullest.

You're the captain. I can protect you for a short while. Use that time to move the Argonauts to distract them.
