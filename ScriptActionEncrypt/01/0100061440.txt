Xuanzang Sanzang. I have no intention of discussing anything with you. Never have, never will.

But I value the depth of your insights.

＠Agravain
It may be from a little girl's perspective, but you must have seen a number of lands.

For that sole reason, there's value in lending an ear to your stories.

...I shall grant you one last chance. A chance to return to this side.
[k]

＠Agravain
You saw what life was like in the Holy City. You saw what life was like among the mountain tribes.
[k]

＠Agravain
I'm sure you also saw Ozymandias's land, the territory of Egypt.
[k]

＠Agravain
With that in mind, let me pose this question to you... Is the Lion King in the wrong?

＠Agravain
Exactly. You of all people should understand, Xuanzang Sanzang. Our Holy City is the only truth, the only ideal.
[k]

＠Agravain
No matter which side you are on, we share the same goal. We are merely searching for a way to survive.
[k]

＠Agravain
“To defend the people of our nation.” Even that Ozymandias thinks the same thing.
[k]

[charaFace H 2]
＠Agravain
But with their policies, they won't change anything. They'll just fall into ruin along with the world, along with the era.
[k]

＠Agravain
Think back on your time in the Holy City. Everyone lived a satisfying life. They bettered each other, they respected each other.
[k]

＠Agravain
The utopia once dreamed of by the King of Knights has come true in the Holy City.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Agravain
You turned your back on that. That alone is an insult to me, but[line 3]
[k]

＠Agravain
The King of Knights... No, His Majesty the Lion King respected your thoughtfulness. Therefore, this will be my final offer.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Agravain
Return to the Holy City, and sit with us at the Round Table. You will fit well in Gareth's empty seat.

＠Sanzang
...I suppose so. To be honest, I've been hesitating this whole time.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Which side I should take... The Lion King, the Sun King, or the mountain people...
[k]

＠Sanzang
I wasn't really into the idea from the start. I couldn't hear the Buddha's voice, either.
[k]

＠Sanzang
When the Buddha is silent, it means things are out of my hands.
[k]

＠Sanzang
In other words, Buddha has been telling me to “butt out” this entire time.

No matter how nice the Lion King's Holy City may be, I know in my heart that the tactics used by the Round Table are wrong!

That's right!

Even if the Holy City is a utopia, selecting who will live in it and then killing the rest is unforgivable! It's an atrocity!
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk H]
[charaFace H 4]
[charaFadein H 0.1 1]
＠Agravain
It isn't an atrocity. It's a conclusion. Those not chosen by the Holy City will die in this wilderness.
[k]

＠Agravain
...Which by itself wouldn't be so bad, except that they'll then develop feelings of hate and jealousy toward it.
[k]

＠Agravain
To build a strong Holy City, we cut off that evil at the source. This is also the mercy of the Lion King.
[k]

＠Agravain
We've never forced anyone. The refugees are free to choose whether or not they wish to receive the Holy City's sanctuary.
[k]

＠Agravain
We wage war, yes, but only to protect the Holy City from its enemies. If the mountain people give up on the Holy Land, we'll cease fighting too.

I've journeyed to the other side of the desert. And saw THAT there. That's why I returned.

Agravain. I promise not to start crying, so tell me. What are you trying to do?
[k]

＠Sanzang
Is the Lion King really in her right mind?
[k]

＠Sanzang
Didn't she lose her human heart a long time ago? Are you sure she's still a Heroic Spirit!?
