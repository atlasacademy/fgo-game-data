Yes, I'll stand in your way. I can't allow[sr]you advance further, no matter what.
[k]

＠Nero
You said that you would destroy the world.

＠Nero
I don't understand. Why would you say[sr]that you were going to destroy the world?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
The world is brimming with beauty.[sr]Flowers, songs, gold, love...

How sad Altera, but even that sadness seems beautiful to me.

＠Nero
I can't just leave you like this.[sr]I feel a great pain and contradiction in your life.
[k]

＠Nero
Perhaps your power exceeds mine, but know that you cannot defeat me in love.

[charaFace F 4]
＠Altera
I know not of love, I know not of beauty.

Magical energy signature rising.[sr]You have to stop her before she unleashes it again.
