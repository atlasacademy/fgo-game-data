Um, Jeanne?[sr]What exactly[line 2]
[k]

＠Jeanne
It wasn't the "Dragon Witch" who possessed the Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
No, actually that Servant, never existed in the Throne of Heroes.
[k]

＠Jeanne
As long as she wasn't an aspect of my darkness, there was no other conclusion I could make.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
...Then how did she acquire that massive strength?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
That couldn't have been anything but the Holy Grail.[sr]In other words, the Dragon Witch herself[line 2]

Exactly.[sr]The Dragon Witch herself was my wish.
[k]

In other words, the Holy Grail itself.

Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you mean?[sr]The dragon's the Holy Grail? Then me, too?
[k]

You dragon-dummy, Jeanne d'Arc didn't use the Grail for evil.

You[line 2]created Jeanne d'Arc with the power of the Grail, didn't you?

＠Gilles
My wish was to revive you. It was a wish from my heart,[sr]from the bottom of my heart. Of course it was.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Gilles
...But the Grail rejected me.[sr]For all its omnipotent power, it said it couldn't do that!
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Gilles
But my wish was only for you![sr]So I created a new you!
[k]

＠Gilles
The Saint I believed in! The Saint I longed for![sr]I created her!
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Gilles
Jeanne d'Arc[line 2]the Dragon Witch.[sr]The Grail itself!

＠Jeanne
...I see. But of course, she never learned that did she?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Gilles, even if you could revive me, I would never become your Dragon Witch.
[k]

＠Jeanne
It's true that I was betrayed, it's true that I was mocked.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
It could only be described[line 2]as a tragic end.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
But I could never hate my homeland.[sr]This is where you and the others lived.
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaFace F 1]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]
＠Gilles
...So kind. Your words are far too kind.[sr]However, Jeanne...
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Gilles
Your kindness has made you forget one thing.[sr]Even if you never hated this country[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Gilles
I HATED THIS COUNTRY![sr]I swore I would destroy it for its betrayal!

＠Gilles
You will forgive them I'm sure. But I never will![sr]Not God! Not the King! Not the nation!
[k]

＠Gilles
I'll destroy them all. I'll kill them all.[sr]That is the wish I made upon the Grail!
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Gilles
DO NOT GET IN MY WAY, JEANNE D'ARC!

...Yes, you're right.[sr]You're absolutely right.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
It makes perfect sense for you to hate, and for you to use the Grail's power to destroy France.
[k]

＠Jeanne
And I[line 2]I will stop you.[sr]As a Ruler, the judge of the Holy Grail War.

I will stand in your way Gilles de Rais!
