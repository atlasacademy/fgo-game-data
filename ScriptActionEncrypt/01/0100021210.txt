I am sensing Servants nearby.[sr]Please be careful, they're very close.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm picking up two signatures from here. You're looking[sr]at a battle with multiple Servants. Watch your back!

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
Where are you Boudica?[sr]Answer me!
[k]

＠Nero
I know you can't be dead yet![sr]I can tell, I can tell. You would never die!
[k]

＠F：???
...No, no.[sr]Isn't that a rather selfish way to put it?

Rest assured, she's safe.[sr]Right now, she's fast asleep thanks to his spells.

[charaFace E 4]
＠E：???
It's a Restraint Spell.[sr]Not like being fast asleep.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]

But she really was sleeping.[sr]Fast asleep.

[charaFace F 3]
＠F：???
I have several names. It's hard to pick one, hmm.
[k]

My name is Alexander.[sr]To be precise, that's Alexander III.

＠El-Melloi II
Lord El-Melloi II. Due to certain reasons,[sr]or should I say fate, I am his strategist.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠El-Melloi II
I am not a true Heroic Spirit.[sr]I'd probably have another name as a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠El-Melloi II
Therefore, it's okay to forget my name.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Alexander
That doesn't work.[sr]We are the enemy generals to her.

Right, Roman Emperor?

Yes, I'm a little bit interested.[sr]That's why I teased you here and there.
[k]

＠Alexander
I wanted to talk to you.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Alexander
If possible[line 2][sr]right here in the middle of the battlefield.
