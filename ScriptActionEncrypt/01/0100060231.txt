That's why I apologized. I concluded you wouldn't settle down unless I dealt that final blow.

Now listen, awoken pharaoh.[sr]Incarnation of the god Horus, Nitocris.
[k]

＠Lucius
It's true that they saved you.[sr]I witnessed it myself, after all.
[k]

＠Lucius
They saw you were about to be taken by the Old Man of the Mountain and company, and saved you honorably.
[k]

＠Lucius
If you still refuse to believe it, then I will have no choice but to use this silver arm once more...
[k]

＠Lucius
Do you wish to lose the Sun King's trust even more? Will your own standing not become precarious as well?
[k]

[charaFace E 9]
＠Nitocris
Uh... But you aren't even citizens of Egypt.[sr]You have no reason to help me...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Lucius
Then let me ask in return: the people of the mountain aside, do the knights of the Holy City have reason to abduct you?
[k]

[charaFace E 8]
＠Nitocris
I... suppose that's...
[k]

＠Nitocris
Only the people of the mountain have the ability to sneak into my temple...

＠Nitocris
Uh, agh... That's... No. Now that I think about it calmly... There's no other explanation...
[k]

＠Nitocris
You have my gratitude, travelers.[sr]...I'm sorry. My short temper got the best of me again...
[k]

？1：By the way, we'd like some water!

？！

[charaFace E 3]
＠Nitocris
W-Water!? In that case, there's an oasis nearby...
[k]

？1：We want some fruit too!

？！

In that case, escort me back to Ramesseum Tentyris, the most prosperous and ideal nation in the desert.
