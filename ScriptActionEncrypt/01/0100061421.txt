Ah, brilliant! That was truly a match worth watching!

I kept biting my fingernails in anticipation... So much that, coupled with this hunger, I was about to eat my own hands! Ah, there we go.

Well yeah, I could've stepped out at any time. But I've finally grown tired of lying around. It's about time I got to work.

＠G：Touta
So, I take it you're the ones who came to attack this fort? Hahaha, you don't say, you don't say!

After all, you must be quite the softies to befriend Xuanzang! Each one of you is an outstandingly good person, I'm sure!

Servant, Archer. My True Name is Tawara Touta. Through fate, I ended up protecting that monk over there.

You're my disciple, remember?

＠Sanzang
Disciples have to protect their mentors, no matter what. Got that?
[k]

＠Sanzang
They have to protect their mentor's integrity, and their mentor's safety.

L-I-S-T-E-N! ...Gee, don't make me worry so much, okay?

O-Okay. Sorry. I didn't think you'd become so meek...

...Huh? No, wait, wait.[sr]It was you. It was you, remember?

＠Tawara Touta
You were the one who said, “That fort looks so much fun!” You were the one who ran off to pick a fight with the knights! And look what came of it!
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Tawara Touta
Next thing I knew, you were already nowhere in sight... I went around looking for you, but then hunger kicked in...
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
I came across a knight in purple armor, but he made quick work of me in my weakened state. Now look at where I am.
