...Good work. I think we've defeated all the evil spirits around here...

I was surprised there was a cave underneath Uruk, but those spirits were every bit as shocking.
[k]

＠Mash
Ana, do you know what those spirits were?

...I'm not sure, but they are like grim reapers... I think.
[k]

＠Ana
You two may not have noticed, but a deadly disease is spreading in Uruk.
[k]

＠Ana
Starting with the weak ones, people fall into an eternal slumber. Those spirits must be connected to that somehow.
[k]

＠Ana
Which is why I thought getting rid of them might reduce the death toll...

＠Dr. Roman
I see. In the Age of Gods, physical death is different than spiritual death.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even if the body's fine, if the soul is taken away by a grim reaper then it means death for that human.

＠Ana
That's right. ...Except having the soul taken away is not quite “death.” It is more like being asleep.
[k]

＠Ana
As long as the body is safe, returning a person's soul will wake them up.
[k]

＠Ana
In the Age of Gods, “bringing the dead back from Kur” is simply a type of medical treatment.

＠Ana
Yes. But, a person cannot be revived if their soul is destroyed before it reaches Kur.
[k]

＠Ana
In that case, the body will share the same fate as the soul. It will shut down and eventually return to the earth.

＠Dr. Roman
Hm. A “life after death” sounds very Age of Gods-y. That must be one reason why the quality of the mana is different here.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So going to the underworld itself doesn't equal death. “Death” is the “nothingness” that awaits beyond Kur, beyond the underworld.

＠Ana
...In Uruk, that nothingness is called the Abyss.
[k]

＠Ana
Whatever it is, the spirits from Kur are like kidnappers that steal the souls of the living.
[k]

＠Ana
There seemed to be many here, so... um, I had you help me to get rid of them.
[k]

？1：How did you find out about these spirits?

[charaFace C 3]
＠Ana
Because... there were so many gathered above the flower shop on the main street...
[k]

？2：You did this for the people of Uruk?

[charaFace C 0]
＠Ana
...No. They were simply an eyesore.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Ana
...Anyhow, we have defeated all the spirits. I will go and report to Siduri. Please excuse me.

Child, remember this: Pity betimes can be a crime unto itself.

Void of purpose, compassion to evil is twisted. So, too, with shame.

However, child, a future may yet be yours. So to you, counsel is greater than any coin.

Heed me, child. Three storms will soon sweep over Uruk.

＠Old Man
Empathize not with the hateful one. Celebrate not with the joyous one.

...And extol not the pained one.

Remember, always. In defiance of your purpose it may be, but 'tis a fool's task to set man 'gainst god.
