＠Nero
Did you hear what that farmer said just now?[sr]The traveler we passed yesterday said the same thing.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
That "an ancient god has appeared."[sr]Could it be true?

I wonder. It's an interesting phrase. If he said[sr]"ancient god," could it be from the Age of the Gods.

"An ancient god appeared on an island in the[sr]Mediterranean." For a rumor, it's very specific.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
Well, Gaul faces the Mediterranean.[sr]It's not unusual to hear such rumors...

We can't tell if it's Lev Lainur or not,[sr]but is it possible that he moved to the Mediterranean?

And is claiming to be a god.[sr]It's a likely story.

An island where a god lives, huh.[sr]Ah, that sounds so romantic!

Question Doctor, is materialization of Divine Spirits really possible?

[charaFadeout A 0]
[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 4]
＠Dr. Roman
It's difficult. So much so that it's nigh impossible.[sr]At least, it's not possible with Chaldea's system.
[k]

？1：Divine Spirit?

Yes. It is different than a Heroic Spirit.[sr]It is said to be a higher being than elementals.

＠Dr. Roman
Divine beings are mentioned in many legends of this[sr]world. Sometimes as a natural phenomenon, or symbols of authority.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They are what you may call God, or gods.[sr]Just think of Divine Spirits as a term to define them.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
They're already gone from the face of the Earth.[sr]Perhaps they never existed in the first place?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
It's hard to understand with magecraft developed after[sr]Anno Domini. After all, we can't observe them in our time.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
When you pray to the gods in times of trouble, they don't give help that easily do they?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
...Maybe that was a bad example.[sr]In any case, they "do not exist."
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
However, several pieces of supporting evidence exist.[sr]Hence we predict Divine Spirits exist in a higher dimension.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
At the very least, they won't do anything directly.[sr]No, they can't do anything.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Anyways, it's impossible.[sr]The world has long been that of humans and civilization.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Even if there was a kind god, realistically they wouldn't be able to regain a lost future.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We're the only ones who can possibly save the world and its future.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
So, let's get back to an earlier topic. Whether or[sr]not a Divine Spirit can materialize as a Servant.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
They can't.[sr]That's the answer.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Even if "they" were inclined to do so.[sr]Even if technology reached realms of True Magic, it's disadvantageous.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In theory, it should not necessarily be impossible though.

＠Dr. Roman
It's probably not a god from somewhere.[sr]Probability of a materialized Divine Spirit is quite low.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
But, there might be that one in a million chance if it's a god that fell from its throne.

It would be a good idea to verify.[sr]Fortunately, we're facing the Mediterranean Sea.
