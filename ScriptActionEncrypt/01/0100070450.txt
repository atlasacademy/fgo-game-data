Oh, welcome back, Lord [%1].[sr]You were cleaning the city river today?

I was getting rid of troublesome birds. It's fine that they fly from roof to roof, but birds are pretty smart nowadays.

[charaFace H 3]
＠Ushiwakamaru
They fly low through the main street, and I ended up damaging a total of four shops, including fruit shops and flower shops.

It's fine. The king has ordered me to do so. I act as an aide to His Majesty during the day, so please, do not worry.
[k]

＠Siduri
Oh, and all the clay tablets over there are tokens of gratitude from the citizens of Uruk.
[k]

＠Siduri
Take a look at them when you get a chance.[sr]This is our way of repaying you.

＠Merlin
Hey, good evening. It's been a while, everyone! Hmm? Want me to listen to your report?
[k]

＠Merlin
There's no need for that. Most of the time I just stayed in the house and didn't do anything.

I know very well what kind of work [%1] had to do.

＠Dr. Roman
I know, right? This is supposed to be the last Singularity threatening humanity.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
But we've got so many people living under the same roof. No wonder it's turned into “Keeping Up with the Chaldeans.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's important for you to get used to life in Uruk.[sr]It'll only help you to know how people lived in this era.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You can kick and scream all you want, but a battle is inevitable. Why not loosen up and have some fun for the time being?
[k]

？1：Good point.

[communicationCharaFace 6]
＠Dr. Roman
If you think about it, moments like these are hard to come by. The Heroic Spirits present aren't normal Servants.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They are all working to protect Uruk like the people living in this era.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's a deeper relationship with human history that doesn't exist in Chaldea. Miracles like this don't come by very often.
[k]

？2：Are you sad that you can't join us, Doctor?

It feels like I'm living in a dorm here every day.[sr]So I don't feel lonely at all.

＠Dr. Roman
[%1], don't worry about me.[sr]Have fun with everyone while you can.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's what's best for Chaldea, too.[sr]Like they say, there's the right man for every job.
