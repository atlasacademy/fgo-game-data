No. Animals are free until they die. Unfortunately, I'm a king.

Oh, Medb, is it? What's wrong? No one to warm your bed at night? I'd be happy to oblige.

＠Medb
No. Rest assured that I have no issue in that area. Actually, I have a bit of news from an earlier report.
[k]

＠Medb
Servants aiming to “correct” this world have appeared. Enemies trying to return this nation to how it used to be.

Well, how will they react?[sr]We're up against Rama and Geronimo, right?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
And that one group.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Do they have a strong sense of purpose? Of duty? Or no reason at all? ...At any rate, what a nuisance.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Medb
Cú, you've changed so much.[sr]You've become more regal.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...I'm still my old self. Everybody has moments when they're not so eager to fight.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
That's just how I'm feeling at the moment.
[k]

＠Medb
I suppose. The animalistic side of you lusts for fulfilling battles and love.
[k]

＠Medb
And the empty, hollow side of you is bored of battle, and just stoically deals with things.
[k]

＠Medb
When summoned as a Servant,[sr]which side manifests is a matter of chance.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Medb
Admittedly, you're basically one of my creations. I'm quite astounded at our compatibility.

[charaFace B 3]
＠Medb
To be sure, I love both sides of you, Cú.[sr]I love you[line 2] Really, truly.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

Shut up. You're annoying.
[k]

＠Medb
[line 2]You're so spiteful.[sr]Hehehe.

＠Medb
That aside, half of Eastern America has already fallen.
[k]

＠Medb
We've killed George Washington and exterminated the majority of the nation's leaders.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Medb
...I thought the battle was won. Who would've known that the West would unite to oppose us?
[k]

＠Medb
“Edison,” was it? I didn't expect a mere human to go this far.
[k]

＠Medb
The worst thing is that they have Karna on their side.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...Fool. I told you to mow them down while they were still weak.
[k]

＠Medb
Look, I didn't think a mere “King of Inventions” would go this far!
[k]

＠Medb
I can't shake the feeling that he has some kind of backing. Something besides the Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Medb
Otherwise, it's impossible to explain how he can oppose us as much as he has.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...Hmm. That's alarming.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Well, I'll go and deal with him in time. Make sure our preparations are in order.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Medb
Yes, of course.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Medb
Well, Cú. Let's dream together. A dream as pleasant as a nightmare.
[k]

＠Medb
When we awake, I'm sure things will have moved forward. Hopefully it will be something to celebrate[line 2] Hehehe.
