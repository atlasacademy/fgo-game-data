You have no intention of leading us to the remote, do[sr]you? It's obvious at this point.

If you have something on your mind[sr]or something to say, be frank with us.

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
She knows a man named Babbage.[sr]She has apparently even talked to him in person.
[k]

＠Mash
She can trace the magical energy because she's[sr]tracing something resembling his presence.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

But, he is not the type to do these kinds of things.[sr]That's what she's saying.

[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
But, your own actions are contradictory. Babbage[sr]isn't the type to do "these kinds of things," right?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Fran
...Uh.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Mordred
Well then, it's simple.[sr]...I hate to quote that stupid brat, but I have no choice.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
Fran. Calm down.[sr]Try using your imagination. You can do that much, right?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
Babbage isn't the type to act like this.[sr]Yet, Helter Skelters are wandering around everywhere.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
So, that means he's being forced into this.[sr]To do "these kinds of things."
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Fran
...Uh!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
Okay, good girl.[sr]So, you understand what you need to do, right?

[charaFace F 1]

Yes, I can tell, too. The magical energy[sr]is concentrated here, even in the Demonic Fog.

Look, over there.[sr]I'm sure [%1] will also hear it soon.

I detected it here as well! It's a giant response,[sr]and almost right in front of you. To think it was there!

Huh, it was in the center of the City Area.[sr]It was right near the apartment.

＠Babbage
[line 3]Listen, listen, listen! I am the King of Steam.
[k]

＠Babbage
Unable to grasp the future that lay within reach,[sr]I am the king of an evanescent world of fantasy.
[k]

＠Babbage
I am known to you rabble as the mage "B". I am a[sr]mastermind behind "Project Demonic Fog" that's enveloping this city.
[k]

＠Babbage
Furthermore[line 3]I am a Heroic Spirit[sr]emerged from the Demonic Fog of the empire's capital.
[k]

＠Mash
...Mage "B?"
[k]

＠Mordred
...One of the enemy bosses, huh.[sr]Damn, I didn't see that coming.
[k]

＠Mordred
True, your name starts with "B." I see.[sr]I was overthinking and missed something so simple.
[k]

＠Mash
However, this...[sr]Is the same shape as a Helter Skelter?
[k]

＠Mordred
This guy's specs are probably way higher.[sr]Just a hunch, but my hunches are usually right.
[k]

＠Mash
He does not seem human.[sr]So he must be... a Servant!

[charaFace D 4]
＠Babbage
I am the King of Steam.[sr]Having died once, I now dwell within a world of fantasy.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Babbage
My fantasies have sublimated to a Reality Marble,[sr]but it's not enough. It's not enough. It's still not enough.
[k]

＠Babbage
Behold how I desire.[sr]Behold how I struggle.
[k]

＠Babbage
With steel, I seek to lead a steam-filled civilization.[sr]With ideas, I seek to lead an inconceivable civilization.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Babbage
And[line 3]I lament the incineration of humanity[sr]and civilization, of the world and the future.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Oh, so that's it![sr]It means that he himself is already a Reality Marble!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's similar to the Magical Tome. Though, the[sr]Magical Tome distributed sleep to materialize.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He will continue to disperse his alter egos infinitely.[sr]Most likely, that's[line 3]
[k]

＠Mash
Mr. Babbage. If what you say is the truth,[sr]we can reason with each other.
[k]

＠Mash
We are the same.[sr]The future should not be burned to ashes!
[k]

＠Mordred
Enough gabbing.[sr]Listen up, you big piece of scrap iron.
[k]

＠Mordred
The daughter of someone you know has come to stop you.
[k]

Listen to what she has to say. Your pompous[sr]speeches and everything can come after that.

＠Babbage
Lovely little artificial human.[sr]Piteous being unloved by your creator, thus craving love.
[k]

＠Babbage
Ah, I can hear your words.[sr]Ah, I can hear your thoughts.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Babbage
That's right[line 3][sr]I...no, we, must fulfill our aspirations as scholars.
[k]

＠Babbage
We exist for the sake of humanity and civilization.[sr]Thus, I sought...a fantasy world, a new era of dreams.

Thus...
