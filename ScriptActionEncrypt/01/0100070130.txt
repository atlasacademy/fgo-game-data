Well, that's that. I may have only pseudo-manifested, but I'm not going to lose to Tiamat's Demonic Beasts!

[charaFace D 6]
＠???
You're not going to get anything from me by stating the obvious. But I will repay you later if I can.

I know, right? No matter what form I may be in, I'm always the best!

Way too many! I'm seeing 60 right now, with more coming! This town has become their den!

There's nowhere to run![sr]You're completely surrounded!

Don't make decisions on your own![sr]Weren't you listening to me?
[k]

＠???
This boat only holds one. To take those two, they would basically have to cling onto me.
[k]

＠???
But didn't I tell you?[sr]In this world, touching me is a sin punishable by death.
[k]

＠???
I only fought because I wanted to.[sr]I didn't fight for you.

Master... [%1], was it?
[k]

＠???
If you're struggling against these Demonic Beasts, then repairing the course of Humanity is but a dream for you.
[k]

＠???
You should quietly return to this Chaldea place.[sr]And if you can't do that...
[k]

＠???
Well, why don't you just die?[sr]I have no intention of helping the weak.
