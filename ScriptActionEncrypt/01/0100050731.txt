Are you all right, Nightingale?[sr]Let me treat your wounds[line 2]

＠Nightingale
I am a nurse, I understand my body more than anyone. I can still move. Wounds like these will heal themselves.

If shedding my own blood spares others from spilling their own, I will gladly do so.

As someone who's joined the military, that's the only mission possible for me.

I'm Robin Hood, Archer class.[sr]And this guy with me here is[line 2]

What the heck? You just blurted it out? No fair. Then I guess there's no reason I should keep mine a secret.

I'm William Henry McCarty, Jr.[sr]Though people call me[line 2]Billy the Kid!

To protect this nation, it looks like I, a Servant from this nation, was chosen.

＠Robin Hood
Assassinate the enemy leader. That works, doesn't it?[sr]Sounds like an appropriate course of action.
[k]

＠Billy
As expected of someone who's been fighting as the Faceless King, you really don't hesitate.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Both of us are used to doing dirty jobs. Right, Boy Outlaw King?

Ah, ha, ha! Well, of course![sr]I'm not gonna deal with guys that spawn infinitely.

Considering our lopsided class distribution,[sr]we could really use a Saber or Lancer in our lineup.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Having only Mash on the front line leaves our formation unreliable... Especially when Nightingale runs off on her own.
[k]

＠Geronimo
The ideal Servant would be someone summoned to this era who has no connection to the Celts...

Oh, just... I guess, um, before I teamed up with this guy, I met some...

[charaFace E 4]

A Saber and a Lancer.[sr]Well... I mean, they were a Saber and a Lancer, but...

They're, like, ultra-problematic children?

One's definitely an Anti-Hero.[sr]But you can communicate with both of them.

[charaFace E 4]
＠Robin Hood
But they were, I guess you'd say...[sr]Well, you'll see when you meet them.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Just don't blame me when you do, okay?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
With our current situation, no matter how problematic the Servant is, we could use their aid.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
When things get dire, Senpai will be able to unite us. Right, Master?
[k]

？1：Well, I'll figure something out.
？2：Yeah, let's make sure things don't get dire.

？！

[charaFace E 1]
＠Robin Hood
Well, that's reassuring. You've fought beside some pretty troublesome folks, huh?
