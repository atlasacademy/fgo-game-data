＠Gilgamesh
[%1], Mash, and Merlin. I am entrusting you with something more important this time.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
You're going out to search for something. Head to the city of Kutha, and retrieve the Tablet of Destinies.

Oh, this is an unexpected job. The Tablet of Destinies is in Kutha?

＠Gilgamesh
Correct. I remember seeing what lies in the future in Kutha when I was on my way back to Uruk from the underworld.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I meditated there, recorded the destiny upon a clay tablet, and left it there.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
It's natural to lose one's memory before or after meditation. I won't even know what kind of destiny was written until I read it.
[k]

？1：So, you wrote a diary in your sleep...?
？2：Does...that happen often?

？！

＠Gilgamesh
Occasionally. Normally gods grant humans visions, but in my case, I can see destiny through my clairvoyance.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Sometimes, I learn of a “future” not related to me, and I record it subconsciously.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
It's useless to me, but it's a priceless treasure to others.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Gilgamesh
Of course, the Demonic Beasts will not see value in that. It's highly likely that it's been left untouched.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Oh, gather information about Ishtar along the way.[sr]There are a few ranches on the way to Kutha.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Gilgamesh
I have damage reports coming from ranchers daily, all pointing the finger at Ishtar. Go find out more details.
[k]

？1：Finally a job about the Three Goddess Alliance!

[charaFace G 4]
＠Gilgamesh
Hmm? ...Well, I guess it is. Much as it pains me to say it, that thing is still a goddess.
[k]

？2：Is Kutha under Ishtar's influence?

Yes. Ishtar flies around northeast of Uruk and has complete control over its sky.

Warrior of Chaldea. I will grant you a pass to exit through Uruk's north gate.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
However, you don't have much time for this mission. Learn all you can and return in three days' time.

Yes! A new mission from King Gilgamesh, Ana!
[k]

＠Mash
This time, it will be a trip to Kutha to reclaim an item. The mission includes Master, Merlin, you, and me.
[k]

＠Mash
Two days of traveling, and one day to search on-site. The best part is, the pay is twenty Priestess Silver!
[k]

[charaFace C 7]
＠Ana
Twenty Priestess Silver... I'll get ready immediately. Please stand by.

＠Ushiwakamaru
Hmm... I'm jealous... Even we've never been to Kutha before.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I'd love to accompany you, but...
[k]

＠Benkei
You shouldn't, Lord Ushiwakamaru. We must head to the Demonic Front tomorrow.
[k]

＠Benkei
We are counting down to the mission to liberate Nippur. We cannot afford to go our separate ways.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Say no more, Benkei. I understand. I just wish I could at least go on a journey with Lord [%1] once, but...
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Well, I'm sure we'll get another chance if we just wait patiently. Now it's our duty as samurai to see them off with a smile.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Kutha is under Ishtar's control, but it is right next to the territory of the Goddess of Demonic Beasts.

There will be many powerful Demonic Beasts there as well. Please be careful on your way.
[k]

？1：You be careful too, Ushiwakamaru.

[charaFace F 1]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Haha. All we do is stand atop a wall and shout out orders, but thank you for your kind words.
[k]

？2：Next time, let's go together.

[charaFace F 1]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Yes. I will eagerly await the next opportunity. Here's hoping it'll be as relaxing as paddling down a gentle stream.

Are you ready? Then, let's head for Kutha.
[k]

＠Merlin
After the formation of the Three Goddess Alliance, Kutha disappeared without warning.
[k]

＠Merlin
One day, we suddenly lost all communication from there. The expedition party that rushed there saw a quiet cityscape.
[k]

＠Merlin
No blood, and the bodies showed no signs of combat. All citizens had met their end as if they died in their sleep.

I don't know. None of the corpses had any wounds on them. They didn't die from Ishtar's arrows nor from the Demonic Beasts.
[k]

＠Merlin
Since then, Kutha is said to be a cursed land, and has become a wasteland that no man ever approaches.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Merlin
Well, in any case, we won't know till we get there. I expect to encounter wandering Demonic Beasts along the way...
[k]

＠Merlin
But those that have strayed from their pack are no threat to [%1] anymore.
[k]

＠Merlin
Let's try to gain the ranchers' gratitude by quickly disposing of them as we move along!
