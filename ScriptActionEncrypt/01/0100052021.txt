Karna and Scáthach are no longer with us.[sr]However, we do have our Master... [%1].
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Rama
If we concentrate our power, we can defeat them!
[k]

？1：Are you forcing yourself?

[charaFace B 4]
＠Rama
Gah.[sr]No, uh... Well, how can I say this...
[k]

＠Rama
...To be honest, I don't know if we can win.[sr]The difference in power is overwhelming.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Rama
Yet I feel as though we can. I had the same feeling when I faced the Demon King Ravana.
[k]

？2：You don't have to force yourself.

＠Rama
Hah, I know.[sr]I'm not forcing myself.
[k]

＠Rama
I'm still far from my limit[line 2][sr]Even if I reach it, I feel as though I can go further.
[k]

＠Rama
Hey, Master.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Rama
I feel love for you.[sr]Mash and Nightingale, too.
[k]

＠Rama
I love these soldiers, who follow my orders[sr]despite my young appearance.
[k]

＠Rama
And I love Sita from the bottom of my heart,[sr]as she entrusted me with her life.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Rama
Love makes me want to protect,[sr]and love makes me not submit to fear.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Rama
Isn't it simple?
[k]

＠Rama
However, when you think about it[line 2]a hero[sr]begins his journey from tiny feelings of that sort.
[k]

＠Rama
This is something I came to understand,[sr]after returning to my youth.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Rama
[line 2]Now, let's go!
