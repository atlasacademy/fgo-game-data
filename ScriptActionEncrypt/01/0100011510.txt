Jeanne, what was bothering you just now?

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
Oh no, there was something on my mind...[sr]It's nothing important.

＠Jeanne
Anyway, it's time to confront the "Dragon Witch."[sr]There shouldn't be anything in our way.

Let's go!

So you finally made it here, huh?[sr]Gilles is[line 2]alive, but delayed.

＠Jeanne Alter
I suppose that's fine. Everything is ready.

＠Jeanne
Tell her what she needs to hear.[sr]...That was Marie's instruction to me.
[k]

I have another thing to ask of you as well.

＠Jeanne Alter
It's too late for talking[line 2]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
It's a very simple question.[sr]Do you remember your family?

I asked you a simple question.
[k]

＠Jeanne
No matter how vivid my memories of battle are,[sr]I remember far more of my life as a simple country girl.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne
Even my dark side should remember those peaceful days.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
No, it's precisely because she remembers them[line 2][sr]that the hatred and betrayal brought her such pain.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I... I...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
[line 2]You don't remember, do you?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
What... What does it matter?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Jeanne Alter
Whether I remember or not, I'm still Jeanne d'Arc!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
That's right. It doesn't matter whether you remember.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
But this settles it. I shall defeat the "Dragon Witch" with sadness, not anger.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
[line 2]My Servants!
