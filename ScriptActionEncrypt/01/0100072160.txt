Hah. Something like that. This is the underworld, after all. There's still room for compromise.

＠Gilgamesh
And listen, Tiamat. Looks like an understanding of death has helped you finally revert to a form of Divinity.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Know that I don't hate you. The people of Uruk may harbor anger, but they don't hate you, either.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
But we are fated never to understand each other.

＠Gilgamesh
You give birth and nurture. We grow up and leave.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
No matter how much love children receive, they must eventually leave their mother's embrace.

[charaFace B 2]
＠Gilgamesh
Here and now, I will demonstrate that truth! Don't worry, I have no intention of dishonoring your corpse.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
We no longer need your foundation of the world! You can rest in the land of death once and for all!

Well. Neither of us have much time. Let's put an end to this, [%1] of Chaldea!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I shall grant you the honor of fighting alongside me at this final hour! Now show me the worth of your tale as a deity slayer!
