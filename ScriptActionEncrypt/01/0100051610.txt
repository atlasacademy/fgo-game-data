We invade, and beat them up. That's our only choice!

？1：They lack the refinement to appreciate it.
？2：They have no tolerance for such things.
？！

I-I see. Then I suppose there's nothing we can do.

One needs knowledge to understand music, too.[sr]If they don't have that, there's nothing I can do.

？1：We need to wait for death metal to be invented.
？！

Right, if death metal was[line 2][charaFace B 2] What'd you just say, little [&Puppy:Deerlet]!?

＠Edison
This is what's known as “letting 100 schools of thought contend,” yes? Anyway, all of you, please reassess the current situation.
[k]

＠Edison
Here's a map. The Celts occupy the eastern half of North America.
[k]


＠Edison
They'll ultimately invade us from two routes, north and south. They're currently making the preparations to do so.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Edison
If we were to invade, we would leave one side exposed. They'd overwhelm us, and we'd lose.

Based on data obtained so far, losing too much land will likely be the condition for defeat in this war.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So I presume.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
The connection to the era is fragile enough as is, it will sever more as the Celts expand their area of dominance.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
In time, this era will no longer withstand its separation from reality...and it will “die.”
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
So, even if we do invade, we have to make sure they don't take any more of our current territory.

...That's how it was... Then the fact that I increased the number of troops and pushed back the front line as a stopgap measure...

But, that was also your limit. You slightly pushed back the front line, but it won't be long before it falls.

[charaFace E 5]
＠Scáthach
Servants will likely be commanding the invading army.
[k]

＠Scáthach
At this rate...the mechanized infantry won't stand a chance, and they'll continue to branch out.

Well, there is some truth to what Eli-Eli is saying. Hmm... Let's first look at our opponents' strength[line 2]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Blavatsky
Queen Medb, Cú Chulainn, Beowulf, Arjuna...
[k]

＠Blavatsky
We may outnumber them, but they have some of the world's greatest heroes on their side... Not just Celtic ones.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
Add to that the Celtic soldiers, who can overwhelm even Servants if there are enough.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
And don't forget the monsters and Shadow Servants they pull into the confusion.
[k]

[charaFace H 4]

To top it off, they can reproduce indefinitely.[sr]Can we defeat them? I can't. Totally impossible.
