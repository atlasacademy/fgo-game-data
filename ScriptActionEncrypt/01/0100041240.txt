...We're through! Hurry!

＠Dr. Roman
The response is coming from right over there![sr]I mean literally! He's right there!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even if his actions are controlled, can we assume[sr]he's on our side, mentally? ...No, we don't know that.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You should assume it'll be a fight.[sr]He'll attack anyone who tries to stop him!

Unfortunately, I must fight you![sr]That's how my current existence has been created.

What?[sr]The Demonic Fog is tinged with lightning?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This is...not good... The Demonic Fog[sr]has enough electricity in it to easily kill a human.

This is what it means to activate the fog.[sr]It absorbs even a Servant's magical energy without limit!
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
Of course, I'm an exception! The Activated Fog[sr]absorbs your magical energy upon approach!
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Nikola Tesla
It's possible it will even absorb your Spirit Cores.[sr]Now, will you still approach me?
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Nikola Tesla
If you want to defeat me, first you must[sr]completely remove this Activated Fog[line 3]

Perfect! While I'm at it,[sr]I'll destroy every Heroic Spirit of Heaven and of Earth!

Old myths are unnecessary! Only "Humans and the Star"[sr]Heroic Spirits should exist beyond the age of electricity!
