＠Drake
Shut up, I'm thinking! Um... The distance between[sr]us and that ship is about this much...
[k]

＠Drake
This storm has a small range... Perhaps...[sr]Depending on distance, it'll be a tailwind for them...
[k]

＠Drake
...The ship's armor is... Oh, that's right.[sr]Since we used THAT for repairs...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
All right!
[k]

＠Drake
You guys![sr]Good news and bad news, which do you want first?
[k]

＠Pirate
Let's see. Bad news first...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
All right.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
This Hektor guy who kidnapped Euryale[sr]probably won't be affected by this storm!
[k]

＠Drake
If we sit tight, he'll probably pull so far away that[sr]we'll never catch up!
[k]

＠Pirate
...Um. So what's the good news?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Drake
Rejoice, guys! We're gonna raise all sails[sr]to and cruise at top speed in this storm!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Let's have another exciting ride through the seas!
[k]

＠Pirate
How is that good news!?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Drake
Shut up or you'll get the boot![sr]Anyways, get moving!

＠Drake
Mash, Asterios, and Lady Artemis,[sr]please help us too!

Boss! Our ship won't last much more!

＠Drake
Really? But it is pretty stable, isn't it?
[k]

＠Pirate
What?[sr]...Now that you mention it, indeed...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
Did you forget? We used a bunch of[sr]dragon scales when we repaired this ship.
[k]

＠Drake
It'll take more than this to sink us![sr]This is no sailboat!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
Got that? Now, charge forth!
[k]

＠Pirate
Boss, there's a ship up ahead!
[k]

＠Drake
Did we catch up!?
[k]

＠Pirate
It's not them.[sr]That ship is bigger than ours!
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
It's similar to Blackbeard's ship!?
[k]

＠Pirate
Yes, but[line 2]
[k]

＠Drake
But?
[k]

＠Pirate
It looks pretty beat up.[sr]That's all I can tell in this storm!
[k]

＠Drake
Give me the telescope!

Hah, ghost ships are usually just vessels that were[sr]abandoned for things like mutiny and starvation.
