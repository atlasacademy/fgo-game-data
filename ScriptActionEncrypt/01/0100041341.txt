I just got word from Dr. Roman.[sr]The operation was a success!

＠Jekyll
They defeated Heroic Spirit Nikola Tesla,[sr]as well as another Servant that appeared from the Fog.

[charaFace G 1]
＠Jekyll
And just now, they succeeded in removing the Holy Grail[sr]from Angrboda.

[charaFace G 4]
＠Jekyll
Oh, I see. That's right. The Grail's been[sr]recovered. Singularity is fixed. Then, yup.
[k]

＠Jekyll
The era is being restored.[sr]Everything that happened here will disappear.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Jekyll
All the Servants will disappear,[sr]and our memories will probably change as well.

...Uh, uh, uh...
[k]

＠Jekyll
Yes... Yes. I see.[sr]Just this once, I think I understand what you're saying.
[k]

＠Fran
...Uh...
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Jekyll
...Yes, you're right.[sr]It is a little sad.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I'll tell you...one thing.[sr]That last Servant was clearly out of control.
[k]

＠Mash
It was probably the unique result of the Demonic Fog[sr]and Makiri Zolgen's last incantation.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
It didn't come here for any special reason[sr]or anything like that, I think.

...What?[sr]Are you trying to make me feel better?

Give it up.[sr]I don't want to end this by killing you.

No, that's not it. I...No...[sr]That's not...

？！

...Haha, I get it![sr]I see! That's what I've said so many times!

Yeah, you're right.[sr]You've got me there.

You'll want to defeat that fox-eared girl first. I don't[sr]know why, but I can see she's a hassle to deal with!

Unknown? No, it's actually more like a Rayshift?[sr]But that's impossible. Only Chaldea has that technology!
