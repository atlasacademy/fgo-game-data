Of course! Creating an inexhaustible number of blades and firing every single one of them at you...

That is the optimal way to fight with this body. In fact, he's the one who's imitating me...!

Well, isn't this a surprise. Surely I'm misremembering, no?

I recall a certain fool calling the new tactic I thought up, perfectly suited to a king as it was, the “ultimate waste of energy.”

What happened to efficiency? What happened to being calm and collected as a weapon? It's unlike you to enjoy the thrill of battle, Enkidu.

In fact, you may be even more powerful than the original. That flying speed was impressive even by my standards.

You must have acquired a fine magical reactor core.[sr]Was it a gift from the three goddesses?

I am the most powerful creation on this planet. There is no need for a defective demigod like you.

Gilgamesh... Fool of a king, enemy of my mother... I WILL KILL YOU!

Never forget that! I will end this world and you along with it!

＠Dr. Roman
...Phew, saved. It looks like Enkidu retreated towards northern Uruk.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But... I don't understand the reason for that retreat. Enkidu clearly had the upper hand.

Fool. Even my help would not have balanced the scales. Only the Wedge of the Heavens can defeat the Chain of the Heavens.

But right now, I cannot use Ea. If we had fought them, I would have died alongside you.

Maybe they were broken. Maybe some cessation of cardiopulmonary function. Well, those kinds of things happen.

？！

＠Gilgamesh
Whatever it may be, it's over. Don't worry about it anymore. I've already accomplished what I came here to do.

Let's go back to Uruk, [%1]. Next time, I will give you an assignment that is most fitting for you!

Ugh... My body is out of calibration. My power output and motor functions are out of balance.

＠Enkidu
The recording is out of order, too. It's only giving me access to previous battle recordings...
[k]

＠Enkidu
...I don't understand. Why is this heart defective?

＠Enkidu
Why did I retreat...!?

So why... Why did my failsafe kick in?[sr]“If you fight him, you will die.”

But I want to talk... No, there is no room for conversation. I will only kill him. That should be sufficient.
