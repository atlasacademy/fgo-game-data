I'm a loser snake, in other words, you're kicking a defeated snake when it's down?

Loser snake? Um, have you ever seen any other Servants besides yourselves?

[charaFace F 2]
＠Amadeus
Just you wait, in time they'll latch on to your head and make noises like, "gyaggggegggo!"

Anyways! You haven't seen any Servants other than[sr]the "Dragon Witch" or Carmilla's group, right?

Oh. It takes guts to make that comeback...[sr]But in any case, a saint?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
I only know of one saint, if you mean someone whose[sr]teachings took root deep within this nation.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Really?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Yes. I met him before coming across Elisabeth.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Kiyohime
I almost fought him, but he realized I was a "genuine"[sr]Berserker and he sheathed his sword.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Kiyohime
His True Name is Georgios.[sr]I believe he is quite a famous saint around here.

That's the real shame.[sr]He went the opposite direction as me, to the west.

This city has been razed by the Witch and her dragon.[sr]I was able to make them retreat, but that won't happen again.

...Then, will you come join us?
[k]

＠Jeanne
Our "Dragon Slayer" is cursed, and we need to remove it immediately.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
However, multiple curses are entwined together, so both you and I must be present...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Georgios
I understand the situation.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Georgios
...The residents have already started to evacuations.[sr]Let us depart once that has completed.
