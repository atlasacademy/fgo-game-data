＠Marie Antoinette
[line 2]Now I understand.[sr]The whole world, never mind France, is in danger.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Although it's in a different form, this too, is a Holy Grail War?

I knew it was dangerous when I learned it was a Master-less summoning, but I didn't expect this.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Amadeus
Now there were five Servants in opposition.[sr]Nine total including Mash, but isn't that too much?

The rule of seven Servants is no more.[sr]...Although that doesn't mean infinite.
[k]

＠Mash
It's not surprising at all if there are more than seven Servants.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...According to the records, one time a total of fifteen Servants fought.

＠Marie Antoinette
Oh, I get it! I've figured it out, everyone!
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
We were summoned so that[line 2][sr]We could defeat them, like heroes!
[k]

？1：It might be to destroy the world.

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Non, non, non![sr]That's not right, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
I love everybody.[sr]Just as I did when I was alive.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
I wouldn't need these feelings to destroy the world, and they wouldn't summon me anyway!
[k]

？2：I think you're right.

＠Marie Antoinette
Yes, yes! I finally feel like I've found my job in life!
[k]

？！

It's perfectly fine to be confident, Maria.[sr]But we're up against powerful foes.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Amadeus
Jeanne and Mash, as well as [%1], are used to combat. But you and I aren't the fighting type.
[k]

＠Amadeus
The numbers matter less than the fact that they're far stronger.

＠Mash
...Indeed.[sr]Vlad III, and Elisabeth Báthory.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
One carved their name into history as a hero, and the other, a murderess...
[k]

＠Mash
The other that looked like a Saber seemed to know Marie...

...That's right.[sr]If she knows who I am, then...
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Perhaps she's Chevalier d'Eon?[sr]I've no proof, though.

＠Dr. Roman
Chevalier d'Eon... A spy with Louis XV's intelligence agency, the Secret du Roi.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
She was also a Dragoon, and a plenipotentiary minister... She, no, maybe he?

＠Jeanne
That might be difficult, I think.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
I've lost my Ruler's ability to see True Names, but there is one thing I could see.
[k]

＠Jeanne
All of them have been given "Madness Enhancement," regardless of their alignment or background.

Kyuu...

[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 4]
＠Dr. Roman
It's probably the power of the Grail. Even without an episode of madness, it can give them Berserker traits...
[k]

[communicationCharaClear]

[charaFace E 4]

＠Marie Antoinette
Hmph. The goal of a Holy Grail War is to get the Grail, but they already have it.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]

It's not fair!

＠Jeanne
But that leaves one mystery.[sr]Why were you summoned?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
...This is just a theory.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Despite the fact that the Holy Grail War hasn't begun, someone already has the Grail.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
This is a reversal of causality. A bug, if you will,[sr]and perhaps the Grail is resisting it.
[k]

＠Jeanne
The greater the opponent, the more powerful the Grail's reaction.

...I see.[sr]In other words, somewhere else in France[line 2]

Indeed. There may be other Servants summoned here like Marie.

That's not necessarily a good thing.[sr]It may just mean more enemies.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Amadeus
But whichever it is, we should start searching for them as soon as we can.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Before the other Jeanne finds them.

[charaFace D 4]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠Jeanne
Indeed.[sr]I've lost my ability to detect Servants.
[k]

So we'll have to depend on Mr. Roman.

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 0]

Sure thing. I can't match a full-powered Ruler,[sr]but I can search farther than a Servant.

Yes Master, rest for a bit.[sr]We'll stand watch.
