＠Dr. Roman
...Monitors are in order. Your time is seven on the dot. Not a single cloud in the sky.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Holy City is right before us... There are hordes of soldiers around the main gate. Looks like they've noticed our advance.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Allied Forces and the Holy City Knights... You could cut the air with a knife.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If either army takes even one step forward, it could trigger a war.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[%1], are you ready?
[k]


？1：...(Silently nod)
？2：...It's scary, but we have to do this.

But Touta just threw me on the back of a horse after seeing me ride one!
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Tawara Touta
What you were doing isn't anything like horse riding! You must have only ridden the tamest of the tame!
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
Showing up on the battlefield looking the way you did would be a bother to us all.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
It would be more terrifying to the enemies if you could just wave your staff around and mutter some scary sounding chants in the back.

...That's right. Damn, Agravain. Now I understand. He's placed archers all along the walls.

[charaFace D 5]
＠Lancelot
Even if we tripled the force of our last attack, it would do no good. Is he trying to end it before we reach the walls?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lancelot
King Ozymandias's army of divine beasts will arrive soon.
[k]

＠Lancelot
They will cause a diversion on the west side of the Holy City, and we will use that opportunity to strike.
[k]

＠Lancelot
My army of knights will also advance before you, but we are not a good distraction... We will suffer heavy casualties from the archers.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Lancelot
I suspect only sixty percent of our army will make it to their gates.

We cannot wait any longer. Worst case, you may have to fight Sir Gawain.

Hmph. I shall wait till nightfall...is what I would like to say, but I must finish what I started.

I'm not detecting an ounce of magic from that storm! This is a natural phenomenon!

A very directional one! I can only call this divine intervention!
