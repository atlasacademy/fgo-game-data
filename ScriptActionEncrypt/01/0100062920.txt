Looks like you guys are the first.

＠Dr. Roman
The Allied Forces' soldiers are coming inside the city, but there's a lot of them. They'll run into the Enforcement Knights eventually.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Their forces are taking control of the area around the main gate and heading towards the center of the city... the castle.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They're about an hour or so behind you, I think. Let's get to the castle while they're distracting the city's soldiers!

...So it seems. I failed to realize they had enough to stop Sir Gawain.
[k]

＠Agravain
The main gate has fallen, and the enemy is inside the city. So please, my liege.
[k]

＠Agravain
There is no need to waste any more time. The Holy Selection is finished. All that remains is your decision.
[k]

＠Agravain
...Bring the Tower at the Ends of the World here. Create the millennial kingdom you once failed to create in Britain!
[k]

＠Agravain
Create the ideal country, which threatens no one, and which no one may invade.
[k]

＠Agravain
I will simply watch the results.

＠Lion King
The waves from the Ends of the World have reached my throne. The Round Table will close, and this area will become a stairway.
[k]

＠Lion King
Camelot will be visited by a time of stormy waves. It is time for all to be ruled by my hand, in the name of the King of Storms.
