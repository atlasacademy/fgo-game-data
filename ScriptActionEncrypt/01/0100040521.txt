＠Mash
Yes, you're right.[sr]His combat powers match what's in the legend.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
He's swift and accurate, like a bolt of lighting[sr]flashing through the sky. You won't sense a shred of doubt in his blade.
[k]

？1：Treacherous Knight?

？2：You mean Mordred?

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Oh, come to think[line 3] I never gave[sr][%1] a proper explanation.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Mordred the Treacherous Knight[sr]has manifested here as a Saber class.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Of course, he's not from this era. He's from the[sr]Arthurian legends of the 5th and 6th century.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
The one who brought upon its end.[sr]He literally betrayed King Arthur.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
It was no ordinary betrayal, either. He brought together[sr]all of Arthur's enemies, both domestic and foreign...
[k]

＠Mash
...and became what we call the Treacherous King.[sr]In peaceful times, he could've been king himself.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
There are many stories of his own glory.[sr]He was originally a Knight of the Round Table[line 3]
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
And is said to be King Arthur's "son."[sr]But there's also stories that the King didn't admit such.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Some say that's the reason for his betrayal.[sr]At the end, why did Mordred betray King Arthur?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Only he[line 3][sr]no, she herself knows.
[k]

？1：Did the rebellion succeed?

？2：Did the rebellion fail?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Yes. Mordred died during the battle[sr]on the Hill of Camlann.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
They killed each other.[sr]She fought King Arthur with the sword Clarent...
[k]

＠Mash
...and King Arthur fought with a holy spear[sr]and pierced her through.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
King Arthur was fatally wounded as well and[line 3]
