＠Bedivere
[line 3]It happened so long ago, I've lost track.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I have seen many things, and forgotten many things. Yet among them, that memory still remains in my heart.

＠???
They say this winter will be harsher. We must dismantle some of the villages.
[k]

＠???
And to think, we only just finished driving away the Picts from the north. The misfortunes continue, Bedivere.
[k]

＠Bedivere
That day, the king visited me when I was deep in thought in the watchtower. With no attendants, alone, out of the blue.
[k]

＠Bedivere
He had the appearance of a young boy, but in truth, he was not so far in age from me at the time.
[k]

＠Bedivere
At 16, he drew the Sword of Selection from the stone, and became the ruler of Britain.
[k]

＠Bedivere
After that, he apparently ceased to age. They said it was the fairies' blessings, but I couldn't help but think it was a curse.
[k]

＠Bedivere
The young king fought through the fiercest battles I've ever seen. He was a great leader who brought glory to Britain.
[k]

＠Bedivere
He led foreign tribes to victory against the tyrannical king Vortigern, who was ravaging the land.
[k]

＠Bedivere
He united the warring feudal lords, fought off the advancing Picts from the north,
[k]

＠Bedivere
put an end to the wave of Saxons closing in from the mainland,
[k]

＠Bedivere
and restored Camelot Castle as the crown jewel of Londinium, the largest city in all the British Isles.
[k]

＠Bedivere
The one and only King of Knights, King Arthur.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I told the king then and there: “As long as you shall live, Britain shall never perish, and suffering shall never prevail.”
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠???
That is not true. Camelot and its surroundings may be flourishing, but the rest of the land remains in ruins.
[k]

＠???
Even if Camelot were to accommodate those whose villages were destroyed, it could not restore their lifestyle.
[k]

＠???
Plowing the land, living life day by day, raising children... That is what leads to future prosperity.
[k]

＠???
There is no future in merely sheltering the people. Eventually, the noose is sure to tighten.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Unlike the Knights of the Round Table, giddy from all their victories and glories, the king always looked grim.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Things were different before Camelot was restored, though...
[k]

＠Bedivere
Sir Kay spoke of how the king used to smile more often, back when he used to travel the island in disguise.
[k]

＠Bedivere
But now, not a trace of a smile remained. The king alone saw the dark clouds waiting on the horizon.
[k]

＠Bedivere
...Perhaps the sunset was making me nostalgic, as at that moment, I asked the king a timid question.
[k]

＠Bedivere
One that stemmed from the doubt and unrest that had plagued me ever since I was granted a seat at the Round Table.
[k]

＠Bedivere
“Why did you choose a knight as worthless as me to be a Knight of the Round Table?”
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠???
You feel unworthy because you are inferior to the others? How foolish. The same goes for me.
[k]

＠???
In build, I am no match for others. In swordsmanship, many are my better.
[k]

＠???
However, bonds must not be measured by strength or weakness alone. Friend and foe, good and evil, benefit and detriment...
[k]

＠???
Just as those are all different things, the Knights of the Round Table all serve different purposes.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Friend and foe. Good and evil.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Friends are good. Foes are evil.
[k]

＠Bedivere
But the king said they were different things.
[k]

＠Bedivere
It was unexpected. In this era of warfare, he was the only knight who looked down and saw the situation in its entirety.
[k]

＠Bedivere
In all likelihood, the king never said this to any of the other knights.
[k]

＠Bedivere
It's something he said only to me. And it's obvious why. In that moment, the king told me thus:
[k]

＠Bedivere
“The Saxon invaders are our enemies, but they are not evil.”
[k]

＠Bedivere
If he had mentioned such a thought to the other knights, many would have criticized him.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠???
...That's right. The Saxons just came to this island searching for land to live on.
[k]

＠???
To us they are the enemy, but their actions are not evil. What they wish for is inherently good.
[k]

＠???
And if it is good[line 3]there must come a time when they will serve an important function for this island.
[k]

＠???
As long as we are human, conflict will arise. The division of friend or foe is born from benefit and detriment.
[k]

＠???
We are now in an era where that is at an extreme. An era of winter where neither side relents until the other is crushed.
[k]

＠???
I hate to even imagine creating a Round Table bound only by strength in such a time.
[k]

＠???
It would fall into evil. We did not take the oath in order to kill our enemies.
[k]

＠???
We took up arms for the future of our brethren. That is why[line 3]
[k]

＠???
That is why we need so many roles, Bedivere.
[k]

＠???
Does our Camelot shine because it was created by force? Of course not.
[k]

＠???
This place is made up of everyone's dreams.
[k]

＠???
It is forged from the desire for man alone to create a utopia... albeit just barely.
[k]

＠???
That's why we need knights like you.
[k]

＠???
Compassionate knights who can pick up on the details of people's lives. Details that Gawain and I wouldn't notice.
[k]

＠Bedivere
...Even now, my heart aches every time I think of it.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I had no idea just how much hopeless the king felt then... Not until I heard about it from Merlin.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Stupid and weak as I was at the time, I responded thus:
[k]

＠Bedivere
“It's too difficult a topic for me to understand, but I, too, enjoy living in Camelot.”
[k]

＠Bedivere
“Thomas's wife gave birth just the other day. Twin girls. Such adorable little darlings[line 3]”
[k]

＠Bedivere
How mundane and commonplace a reply. Yet I remember giving it with such satisfaction, such delight.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠???
[line 3]Good grief, you had me worried for a moment. Such concerns do not become you, O simple and honest Bedivere.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠???
However, I am heartened to learn you lead such a fulfilling life. That should be a source of sustenance for all.
[k]

＠Bedivere
[line 3]His hair shone gold in the sunset. That was the moment when I finally felt I was in the presence of a true king.
[k]

＠Bedivere
The knights feared they had not seen the king smile for quite some time. But that was not the case. Truly.
[k]

＠Bedivere
The king did not smile for himself. He smiled upon seeing the happiness of others.

...King Arthur's final battle, the Battle of Camlann.

＠Mash
It was war not with the invading Saxons, but within the nation between the knights of Britain.

＠Mash
Despite killing the traitor Mordred at Camlann, King Arthur himself suffered a fatal wound.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
“The king cannot recover on a hill soaked with blood.”
[k]

＠Mash
Believing so, Sir Bedivere carried King Arthur to a pure, sheltered forest.
[k]

＠Mash
Lying there, the king quietly spoke.

“Beyond this forest and over the hill is a lake. Cast my famed sword into it.”

...The famous legend of returning the sacred sword Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
King Arthur, sensing his own death, chose to return it to its proper owner.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
However... that would mark the end of his life.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
His faithful retainer Bedivere, out of concern for the king, twice failed in this task.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
As long as the sword existed, the king was immortal. Bedivere believed it had the power to heal his mortal wound.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Through the woods, over a hill, debating the sword's return with each trip to the lake, he would fail and return to the king.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And upon his return, he would lie to the king by saying, “I have returned the sword.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It is said to be Sir Bedivere's one and only act of disloyalty.

[charaFace A 12]

But King Arthur could not be deceived. In a quiet voice, he would say to him, “Do your duty.”
[k]

＠Mash
And so Bedivere made a third journey over the hill. This time, it was at dawn.
[k]

＠Mash
Accepting that he could no longer sway the king's heart, he cast the sacred sword into the lake's depths.
[k]

＠Mash
With Excalibur delivered to the Lady of the Lake, he made his way back to the forest.
[k]

＠Mash
...That is how King Arthur drew his final breath, and fulfilled his responsibility.

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Yes. Sir Bedivere's anxiety is indeed a cause for concern. Fighting against his former brethren must also be tough,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
but above all, his beloved King Arthur is being a tyrannical ruler, completely different from how he was in life.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even in the name of justice, turning on a king you once served must be an unforgivable act for a knight.

[k]

＠Hundred Personas
There are many who promise to help, then flee. Leave one of your members here.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
It'll be an exchange for the captured Old Man of the Mountain. I won't have any objections then.

Then please take one of our leaders, Sir Bedivere, as your hostage!
[k]

＠Mash
Guard him with your strictest men, so he can't do anything but lie down!

O-Okay. That Knight of the Round Table, huh? That sounds like a fair exchange.

Excellent. It'll be a good chance for Bedivere to take a load off!

？2：Thank you, Hassan of the Cursed Arm.

＠Cursed Arm
No no, likewise. You were brilliant.

Um, what about Arash? I don't see him here...

[charaFace G 0]
＠Hundred Personas
I've asked Lord Arash to protect the village. There's no guarantee that Mordred won't come back.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
And, without me, the village won't have anyone to provide food.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
But thankfully, when it comes to hunting, Lord Arash is more skilled than me. He will make sure everyone eats.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
This isn't the front lines... It's a shelter for people who can't fight.

I see... That's why everyone looked so worried...

...Let's go. No need for unnecessary sympathy. After all, it takes an entire day to reach the fort.

We're surrounded by bandits. Time's too precious for detours. We'll rout them and advance, [%1]!
