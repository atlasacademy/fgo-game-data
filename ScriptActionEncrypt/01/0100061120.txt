Huh? Who cares? This was instinct... Pure instinct.

＠Mordred
I swung my sword where I thought gloomy losers like you would be cowering, and bingo! That's all.
[k]

＠Mordred
Well, it was a hit, but not my main target. Those traitors that Lancelot let slip away[line 3]
[k]

＠Mordred
That's the prey I wanna steal from him... I just got stuck with you losers instead.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Mordred
...Yeah, dammit. This was my chance to drag Lance's name through the dirt and report it to Father[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Mordred
And wiping out a run-down village like this won't earn me any praise. I can't even get a scolding!
[k]

＠Mordred
How are you gonna pay for this, huh!? I've only got a few days left until I'm executed!

＠Mordred
Yup, that's right! Once Father's Holy Selection is done, everyone outside the Holy City is going to hell!
[k]

＠Mordred
He didn't give me a castle in the Holy City, so that means I'm going up in flames, too!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Mordred
So how 'bout it, eh? We're both gonna die in vain anyway. Tell me the village where those traitors escaped to.
[k]

＠Mordred
If you do, I'll give you a nice, easy death. I won't even manhandle the villagers, just slit their throats.

Sir Mordred! Enemy ambush from the rear!

It seems several Enforcement Knights courtesy of His Majesty the Lion King have been defeated!

＠Mordred
Huh? There's no way those tin cans would lose to any old soldier.
[k]

＠Mordred
You sure it's not some of Ozymandias's monsters? It wouldn't surprise me if those guys broke the alliance...
[k]

＠Soldier
The thing is... the enemy looks to be several Servants!
