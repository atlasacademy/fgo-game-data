Hello, Mash Kyrielight.[sr]I'm Romani Archaman.

From now on, I'll be your primary physician.[sr]Oh, is it all right if I take a seat here?
[k]

＠Mash
...Since that was unprecedented, my words and actions were delayed.
[k]

＠Mash
No doctor has ever entered this room before.
[k]

＠Mash
The reasoning was that it was sufficient to speak through the glass.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Oh, is that right? To be able to convey your feelings even through glass... Chaldea is very advanced indeed.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
But I'm still quite an amateur. I can't have a proper conversation unless I talk to people directly like this.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So please don't hesitate to tell me what you think or feel. I want you to tell me all kinds of things.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Communication is the best way to achieve mutual understanding. You can acquire far more information and feel someone else's warmth, right?
[k]

＠Mash
“I see,” I nodded. Indeed, more information can be acquired this way than through glass.
[k]

＠Mash
The manner in which someone speaks. Their gaze. Temperature. Scent. Mannerisms. All things I have never experienced before.
[k]

＠Mash
If such interactions are deemed human-like... for the first time, I responded in a human-like fashion by...
[k]

＠Mash
...agreeing to his proposal.[sr]“Hello, and nice to meet you, Doctor Romani.”
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Oh, about that. I don't like the name Romani, see.[sr]And the name Archaman is a bit pretentious.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
I'd like you to call me Roman.[sr]Doctor Roman. Sounds good, huh?
[k]

＠Mash
I know the word “Roman” may stem from “Romanticism.”
[k]

＠Mash
It means to observe the world not by reason or logic, but to observe it spiritually, subjectively.
[k]

＠Mash
The definition of the word changes from person to person. Even so, if I had to explain it[line 3]
[k]

＠Mash
It is the philosophy of “imagining a good future.”[sr]The sense of fulfillment when living one's own life.
[k]

＠Mash
Unlike my allotted period of activation, which is a detailed and efficient “schedule.”
[k]

＠Mash
Perhaps the hopeful observation that “tomorrow holds many possibilities” is what the word is trying to express.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Oh my. That's quite a serious opinion you've got there. You sound like a senpai character from a Japanese comic.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Oh... but that should be okay. You've been in Chaldea a lot longer than I have, so that would make you the senpai.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
(Sigh) It's rather pathetic, actually. Although I am the head of the medical department,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
for the longest time, I didn't even know this section existed. I am truly sorry.
[k]

＠Mash
Doctor Roman apologized to me for no reason.[sr]What a mysterious person. Also, he was wrong.
[k]

＠Mash
The Japanese terms “senpai” and “kouhai” are similar to that of a teacher and a student. However, I have yet to learn a single thing from the Doctor.
[k]

＠Mash
Since my knowledge was input from Sheba, that would make Sheba my senpai in terms of knowledge.
[k]

＠Mash
And so, when it comes to knowledge and information within Chaldea, I am the kouhai.
[k]

＠Mash
...Aside from that, though it may be impossible, if I had a senpai in life...
[k]

＠Mash
It would be someone inherently human and of average status. Not the best, but a normal person who strives to do their best.
[k]

＠Mash
I think it would be someone who doesn't hurt others and never gives up. An upright human being.
[k]

＠Mash
After all, that's the kind of person I was modeled after when given life.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
I see. You're right, not many people like that exist here in Chaldea.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The staff here is made up of freaky geniuses.[sr]There isn't anything normal or average about them.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Well, good and bad, normal or not, I guess all that makes up what it means to be human. I'm sure one day you'll find a senpai that you can truly rely on.
[k]

＠Mash
...The Doctor's words left a really strong impression on me. A senpai that I could truly rely on...
[k]

＠Mash
To imagine such a future sure made my eyes flicker with hope... A future filled with “romance.”
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
All right, then. Once again, nice to meet you, Mash.[sr]Let's try to make this a lasting relationship.

＠Dr. Roman
...There you have it.[sr]That's as much as I can disclose about Mash.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Chaldea is an organization listed under the United Nations, yes, but it's actually also a research facility for the Mage's Association... for the Animusphere family.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In the name of safeguarding humanity's future, they carried out numerous unethical experiments.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Namely, fusing a Heroic Spirit and a human[line 3][sr]the Demi-Servant experiments.[charaFace B 5]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As you must know yourself, despite being used as familiars, Heroic Spirits are superhuman entities.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They could even kill their Masters and return to the Throne of Heroes if they so desired.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
You could hardly call them safe weapons. As such, the previous director looked for a more reliable way to harness their power.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Normally you would use relics related to them as catalysts for the summoning, but Chaldea used human children instead.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Children possessing not only magical circuits fit to summon Heroic Spirits, but also innocent souls.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Using this method, Chaldea wanted to fuse Heroic Spirits with children and turn them into humans.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Owing to this concept, the previous director secretly created children by artificial insemination in Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
That was over ten years ago, at the turn of the 21st century. That was also how Mash was born.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
She's a human created through artificial insemination... through DNA manipulation.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In terms of being created, you could say she is similar to a homunculus.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
However, fundamentally, she's just a human...[sr]A human with excellent magical circuits.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Please make no mistake about that. I'm also sure Mash doesn't want [%1] to have the wrong idea about her.
[k]

？1：...
？2：Of course, I wouldn't do that.

？！

[charaFace B 7]
＠Dr. Roman
You're right. It was stupid of me to assume that.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Anyway, several years after Mash's birth, they conducted the fusion experiment.
[k]

？1：Director Olga Marie said the experiment failed...
？2：...

？！

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
No. The summoning itself was successful.[sr]A Heroic Spirit was summoned within Mash.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That was the second Heroic Spirit summoned by Chaldea. However, the Heroic Spirit did not awaken.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
It must've been a noble Heroic Spirit. They didn't want to acknowledge Chaldea's... the previous director's actions.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
“Should I depart, the girl will die. Therefore, I will not leave, nor will I awaken.”
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...Mash proved that humans can fuse with Heroic Spirits,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
but at the same time, proved how unethical those fusions can be.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even when they're Anti-Heroes, Heroic Spirits reject being fused with humans, for some reason.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
And so the fusion experiments were aborted, and a year later, the previous director was found dead in his office.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It was ruled a suicide based on the circumstances.[sr]Marie came here after that.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
The rest is exactly as you imagine.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I somehow got Marie's permission to add Mash to the staff.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even if her Heroic Spirit never awakened, her capacity as a Master is first-class.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I thought to myself, “I won't let this precious resource go to waste.”
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Initially, Marie was scared. Of course, who can blame her.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
First, the father she idolized passed away, then she found out about his cruel experiment.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]
＠Dr. Roman
She was so shocked she refused to eat for an entire month. Plus, she was like, 30% more hysterical about everything.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
She was close to a mental breakdown when she took over as director. But the one thing that scared her more than anything...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...And that was giving freedom to the one successful case of Heroic Spirit fusion. Since she was already so worried, it was only natural that she was scared of Mash.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
“Mash is going to take revenge on me! She will viciously kill me in the restroom! Why wouldn't she!?”
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Marie would scream about that endlessly.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
However, even as she was consumed by fear, she never once turned her back on Mash.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That was her charm. She was so serious about everything, she would never do anything immoral no matter how much she hated it.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Thanks to that, Mash was acknowledged as a human, and given freedom within Chaldea.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Of course, her freedom was only allowed within Chaldea. Even though she possessed magical circuits any mage would dream of, her body was too pure.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Having been raised in a sterilized room, her body couldn't adapt to the outside world.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
For as long as she remained operational, she'd only be able to live in Chaldea.
[k]

？1：...
？2：“As long as she remained operational”?

？！

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
What makes Mash different from other human beings is that her lifespan has been predetermined.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The designer babies created by Chaldea mostly ended in failure.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Mash was one of the rare survivors.[sr]Even so, her cells started to degenerate at a rapid rate.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Her physical body won't age any more than it already has. So she won't die of old age.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But she'll expire when her life force dries up.[sr]One day, suddenly, like a robot running out of batteries.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Of course I worry about her and want to help her.[sr]I'm not heartless.

But when it comes to her lifespan, I don't pity her.[sr]That would be an insult to her.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Sure, her life has a definite end.[sr]But the same can be said for all lifeforms.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Life is full of suffering and sorrow.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In that regard, we are not so different from Mash. Humans cannot escape from the fear of death.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]
＠Dr. Roman
...Sorry, I'll get back on topic.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Mash was then selected as a Master candidate, and in a short time, the top candidate of the A team.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Shortly after that, the light on Chaldeas disappeared.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Olga Marie negotiated with the United Nations, and got approval to investigate singularities with Masters.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's when candidates like you were assembled, followed by that incident...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
...where the Command Room was damaged and you were Rayshifted. It was then that Mash became a Demi-Servant.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
That must be reason she can function in the outside world, albeit only in her Rayshift destination.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
...However, the fundamental problem remains unsolved.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
By becoming a Demi-Servant, Mash acquired a more durable body. Even so, her cells have a lifespan.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
She can remain operational for at most one more year... That's what I wanted to tell you.
[k]

？1：Does Mash know about that?

In Mash's eyes, the time you spend as friends has become something irreplaceable.

That much is clear just by looking at her brainwave graphs since the start of the Grand Order.

It was such a long battle, and a war, no less... Seems like my body sustained more damage than usual.

But as you can see, I've recovered now, so there's no problem. I've gained experience too, so that will come in handy next time.

You and Mash will continue your search for the Holy Grail. Do either of you have any objections?

I see. Then let's move up the schedule and start[sr]the briefing. About the Sixth Singularity we've discovered[line 3]
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
The era is the 13th century. The location is Jerusalem, known as the “Holy Land.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
To be precise, it's 1273 AD. The Ninth Crusade has just ended, and the kingdom of Jerusalem has vanished from the face of the earth.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
The end of the Crusades...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The western nations' withdrawal from Jerusalem has greatly affected the history of mankind.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You could say it's an apt time and place to be chosen as a Singularity.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...At least that was the case until yesterday.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The truth is, the Sixth Singularity was detected before the one in America.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But the results from Sheba were just so unstable.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The era couldn't be verified, and at times, no observation could be carried out.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Do you understand? It's not like all we observed was the red color of burning lands.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There were times when the light of observation itself disappeared. In other words[line 3]
[k]

[charaFadeout B 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 6]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Mash
...The Sixth Singularity doesn't exist on the surface of Chaldeas. That section alone is hollowed out completely.
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 5]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Dr. Roman
That's right. This is unprecedented. The Sixth Singularity is trying to leave the flow of humanity.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
All Rayshifts until now have been battles against Solomon's Holy Grails. Each threatened to disrupt its respective era.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This time, the Singularity itself is becoming history that should not exist.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If we leave it alone, human history will be severely damaged, independent to the restoration of Solomon's incineration.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Thus, the Foundation of Humanity evaluation of the Sixth Singularity is EX, meaning everything about it is unique.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]
＠Dr. Roman
Once again, we can't provide much backup from Chaldea. We have no idea what's going on[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Are you still willing to go with Mash, [%1]?
[k]

？1：Of course.
？2：As always.
