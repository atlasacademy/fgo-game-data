＠Cursed Arm
Whew... That was impressive. Impressive indeed.

＠Cursed Arm
The great founder would behead me if I were to let such a formidable force go. He would say, “A blind man has no need for a skull.”

[%1], Lady Mash, Sir Bedivere...
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
Let me be the one to ask you. Would you please fight alongside us?
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
I can't promise any rewards... But on my honor as an Old Man of the Mountain, I swear to take you to the Lion King.
[k]

？1：The pleasure is ours.
？2：That'd be the best reward!

Then it's settled. I thought we were already buddies at the point when [%1] came to the village, but...

We've each got our positions to protect. Especially Hassan, who's an Old Man of the Mountain.

＠Cursed Arm
Let me introduce myself properly. I am Hassan-i Sabbah.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
I became the leader of the religious sect born in this land, but assassination is my occupation now.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
The heads of our sect are all given the names “Hassan” and “Old Man of the Mountain.” We succeed our great founder's name.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
There is usually only one Hassan per era, but in the current situation, other Old Men of the Mountain have been summoned.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
We've abandoned our pride as assassins and revealed ourselves, protecting each of our villages as leaders.

...It's fine. If anything, I shouldn't have been so stubborn.

＠Cursed Arm
You fought for our people at the gates of the Holy City,

＠Cursed Arm
even abandoning your objective of closing in on the Lion King. How can I not trust such an act?

Hahaha. No need to thank me. After all, I'm the only one who trusts you, Sir.

I can't guarantee what the other Hassans will think of you.

Yes. They are few, but they are elite, able fighters. Not nearly enough to recapture the Holy City, though.

Yes, they can't hope to win. It'll be up to us to do something about that.

Naturally. That's why I have been trying to gather as many Old Men of the Mountain as I can, but...
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
Hassan of the Trembling Pipe lost to Lancelot, and Hassan of the Peeling Shadows lost to Gawain.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
I hope the best assassin among us, Hassan of the Intoxicating Smoke, will answer the call...
[k]

？1：There really are a lot!

[charaFace E 1]
＠Cursed Arm
Of course. We Old Men of the Mountain are a religious sect that spans eighteen generations since our great founder.

“This will be a war of attrition. Do not stir up trouble with the Lion King.”

Those were his words as he parted with me, but... To think that he'd name me at the end...

＠Cursed Arm
...You have my thanks, [%1]. I won't let his regrets die in vain.
