＠Da Vinci
What, no reunion hug? I guess not? Hmmm, that's too bad. I was looking forward to it.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Da Vinci
Well, I'll just put it down to your being too shy to hug in front of people!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
At any rate, I can plainly see your happiness. But if you open your mouth that big, you'll dislocate your jaw.
[k]


？1：I just can't keep it shut!
？2：That tone! it's the real Da Vinci!

Ah, good, finally connected. It seems like you've returned from the desert zone.

＠Dr. Roman
Your safety is the most important thing. I see Da Vinci there as well. Yup, all is right in the world...

[%1] and Mash were all sad, so I read the room and decided to play along, that's all.

[communicationCharaFace 4]

In fact, your being gone would be nothing more than a nuisance, that's all.

Eww, this guy is gross. It's not cute when a guy acts tough, especially when he's single and over 30.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
I'm not acting tough. I'm just glad our helping hand is back, that's all!

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...But more importantly, how did you survive?[sr]That staff exploded, didn't it?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I didn't think there was any way I could help you.

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Ah, that was an unexpected development for me too.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I thought if I tossed it high into the air, I'd at least be able to avoid instant death, but...

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
I didn't expect, of all things, the knight leading the enemy assault to jump in front of me and cover me. Can you believe it?

We confirmed the name of the Heroic Spirit lending me their power, as well as the true nature of the Lion King's sacred lance.

The truth about the sacred lance, eh?[sr]Now that sounds interesting!

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
I'd like to know the details of things up until now too, seeing as I was stuck here and everything.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
To tell the truth, I've only been able to stand up like this for a few days. Before this, I was confined to my bed.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
Well, I suppose I did hear about your exploits from him, though.

From him...?

That's the one.[sr]I was much obliged that time, [&young man:young lady].

＠Da Vinci
I had Saruhan assist the refugees fleeing in the opposite direction to us. He's a first-class thief.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Some time after that, he couldn't look after them anymore, so he pushed the refugees here.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
From then on, I had him look into the state of the wastelands. He did some hard work for very little money.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Saruhan
You were quite the nuisance, though.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Saruhan
But, well, there's no replacement for Ms. Da Vinci's wisdom. Her skills in the wastelands proved to be a highly valuable resource.

Like finding a source of water and digging a well in a day, I thought she was a goddess of salvation.
