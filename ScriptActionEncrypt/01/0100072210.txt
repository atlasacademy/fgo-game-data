You've won. Now that Tiamat has been destroyed, the Singularity's cause is vanishing.

Besides, I'm bad with magecraft. I say incantations too fast and get my tongue tied. It's just easier to beat people down with a sacred sword instead.

So I'm like, “Arrrrrrgh[line 5]”! And I ran above the mud, and caught her at the last second like a BOSS!
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
She was so hot and fiery, my fur was burning. And thanks to the slippery mud, we were on a non-stop slip-and-slide course to the port.

I managed to make it to the forest, meow, and buried Kuku in the ground, and just when I got back to Uruk...

Yeah. Sorry this had to come right after you got back. The time has finally come, [%1].

＠Dr. Roman
Solomon is interfering... No, we're being drawn in, I imagine.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We've analyzed the Holy Grail from the Seventh Singularity. The result[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We've found the coordinates for a Singularity that doesn't exist in human history. Confirmed, it's Solomon's[line 2]the Mage King's[line 2]Singularity!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But the reverse is true, too. The second we learned those coordinates, Solomon learned the coordinates of Chaldea.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In other words, Chaldea is trying to merge with the Mage King's Singularity.
[k]

？1：So we're headed straight into the enemy's lair, basically?

？！

That's correct. More annoyingly, their spatial strength is greater than ours.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If we continue to be drawn in like this, this place is going to be destroyed, like a star being sucked into a black hole.

＠Dr. Roman
Right. We'll just have to defeat Solomon before then.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We know the coordinates of their Singularity. We can Rayshift at any time.

＠Dr. Roman
...I wanted to adequately test our plans before taking him on, but...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...It looks like that's not going to happen. We don't have any time, and neither does humanity.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Solomon's goal. The band of light. What exactly is the Incineration of Humanity?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This operation will see all those questions answered.
[k]

？1：...It's finally time...
？2：...The final...

？！

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Yes, as the acting commander of Chaldea, I am ordering everyone to prepare for our final battle.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As of today, the lives of all the staff in Chaldea are in my, Romani Archaman's, hands.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Master [%1]. Mash Kyrielight.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I will give you one day of rest. I need you in peak physical and mental condition.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
When you two return to this control room, Chaldea's final battle will begin.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We will head towards Solomon's Singularity. The Final Singularity, The Grand Temple of Time: Solomon!
