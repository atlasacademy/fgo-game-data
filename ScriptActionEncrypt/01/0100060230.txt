...As I have only just awoken, I am merely at half strength...but no matter! It is surprising to be pushed this far, however...

＠Nitocris
I must say, those were some drastic measures.[sr]You're quite the warriors, I'll give you that.
[k]

[charaFace E 9]
＠Nitocris
However, your trial begins now. You committed a grave sin by disgracing me, and I want to know whether you can atone for it.

＠Nitocris
The pharaoh granted this divine beast to me. You shall be tested by it until you are torn limb from limb!
[k]

？1：This is a misunderstanding, we just helped!

[charaFace E 7]
＠Nitocris
[line 3]How shameless.[sr]Do you really think I'd believe you?
[k]

？2：You look elegant, but you're unreasonable!

[charaFace E 2]
＠Nitocris
Of course. Pharaohs must first assert their own justice!

[line 3]Even so! That doesn't change the fact that you witnessed my disgrace!
[k]

＠Nitocris
Besides, you don't have any proof![sr]Why did you save me!?
[k]

[charaFace E 9]
＠Nitocris
Did you happen to be here out of coincidence?[sr]And you saved me, despite not even knowing my name?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Nitocris
That is an impossible story! Saving a stranger for no reward in this land at the end of the world!

You bear the armor of the knights from the Holy City![sr]I cannot trust you!

Go, sphinx! Bestow upon them the judgment of the great Sun King!

Sphinx!? Fighting a divine beast in our current situation is too harsh!
[k]

＠F：???
No, please raise your head.[sr]No divine beast could shatter your shield.
[k]

＠F：???
Above all, the justice you stand for is right. You will easily overcome a battle born of a misunderstanding such as this.

We have yet to forge a bond for you to know my name. You may consider me the same as an enemy for now.

You must be the one called [%1], yes? I am Lucius, a Servant without a Master.

＠F：???
I just couldn't help but interrupt. You may think I'm meddling, but please forgive me for that.

If you don't mind, I can lend some assistance.[sr]My sword is yours, make use of me as you will.
