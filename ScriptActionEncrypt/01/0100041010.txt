＠Mordred
Let's go there and pound them down.[sr]Ah. But first.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Yes?

＠Mordred
There's one thing I need to say.[sr]This time, my hands are tied protecting Fran.
[k]

＠Mordred
You see, she's not a Servant, and it's unknown[sr]how much damage an artificial human can take.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Mordred
So "I'm going to protect her."[sr]...We have a strange connection.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We can't count on Mordred during the battle then,[sr]so you guys will have to provide all the muscle. Be careful!
[k]

？1：Roger.

？2：No problem.

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Right.[sr]Okay then, Senpai. Let's move out!
