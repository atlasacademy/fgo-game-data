＠Karna
No matter when or what era.[sr]Only I can ever be your opponent.
[k]

[charaTalk B]
＠Arjuna
Each time I am summoned to a Holy Grail War as a Servant, it seems I always end up searching for you.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Arjuna
While attempting to be a proper hero...[sr]I would seek you, and be disappointed.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Arjuna
...Never again will we have an opportunity such as this.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Karna
...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arjuna
The moment you stood before me,[sr]all my other priorities evaporated.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Arjuna
[line 2]So, Karna.[sr]Shall we begin where we left off?
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Karna
...We shall, Arjuna.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Karna
Both you and I seem to be held captive by a chronic disease that can never be cured.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Arjuna
...However.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Karna
Yes.

[line 2]That is our very delight.

This world has no gods, no curses, not even destiny.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arjuna
Precisely because there aren't, I made facing you my only desire upon the Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Arjuna
...And now, that wish has come true.[sr]I have no interest in saving this world.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arjuna
If it is to perish, it shall perish.[sr]Yet, you attempt to save it[line 2]this world.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Karna
Of course. As long as people wishing to live proper lives exist, I will continue to protect them.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Karna
I was given this power for that purpose. Know that as long as my father and my life remain, the sun remains immortal.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Arjuna
That is why I am for destruction.[sr]If you stand with the good, I shall stand with the evil.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Arjuna
That is equality. This time[line 3]surely this time, I must put an end to your very existence as my equal!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Karna
...Now then. Arjuna. Do you know the saying[sr]“Curses, like chickens, come home to roost”?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arjuna
[FFFFFF]?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Karna
No, it's nothing. There was once someone who taught me that. Watching you just reminded me of him.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Karna
Like it or not, we've known each other the longest.[sr]On account of that, promise me one thing.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Karna
If you defeat me, fulfill your original duty as a Heroic Spirit. Save the world with your “Agni Gandiva.”
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Karna
...I hate to admit it,[sr]but you're far better at that sort of thing.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Arjuna
...Very well. But once it's decided,[sr]don't make that your reason for defeat.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Karna
Never. I would never fight for defeat.
[k]
[charaFace C 0]
Upon my spear, upon my armor, I swear it.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Karna
I swear upon my father and mother[line 2]that victory will be mine.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Arjuna
I also swear victory upon my parents[line 2]and my brothers.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Arjuna
After tens of thousands of years,[sr]I've finally obtained this chance!
[k]

＠Arjuna
Not even evil spirits out there can interfere with me!

[line 2]Here I go!

But if we defeat it, it's just one more push before their front line crumbles! Let's do this!
