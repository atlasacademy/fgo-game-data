Well, if it isn't little Rushd! Don't give me that look. You're scaring me.

I'm just going to sit at the entrance to the village and shoot the idiots who try to climb up.
[k]

＠Arash
Evacuation is the worst-case scenario. I wouldn't be so careless as to let them crawl up here.
[k]

＠Rushd
But we should all run together! Look at how many there are!

＠Arash
You've got good eyes. They're still a few kilometers away. Makes me want to teach you some more.

＠Arash
Anyway, take it easy! Who do you think I am? I have the same name as a legendary hero!
[k]

＠Arash
I'll take care of them all in a flash. Until then, I'll leave you in charge of the villagers, okay?
