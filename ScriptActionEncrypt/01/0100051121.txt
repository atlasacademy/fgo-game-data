＠Rama
Don't hurt yourself too much for me, Nightingale. I know of shame, and you mentioned something similar earlier.
[k]

＠Rama
I don't wish for you to be harmed.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]
＠Nightingale
Be quiet. For me, the second most hated thing in this world is an incurable illness.
[k]

＠Nightingale
What I hate most are patients who don't try to recover.
[k]

＠Rama
S-Shouldn't it be the opposite?
[k]

[charaFace C 7]
＠Nightingale
No. Incurable diseases will become curable someday.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Doctors and nurses like myself constantly work towards that goal, racking our minds and building knowledge.
[k]

＠Nightingale
We must cure illness, even if that means killing people.[sr]Disease must be killed, massacred, and exterminated.
[k]

＠Nightingale
[line 2]But to do that, a patient's willpower is imperative.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Curing a patient who has no will to recover is impossible, for any doctor.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Medical treatment can only begin when someone has the will to be healed.
[k]

＠Nightingale
I intend to cure you.[sr]I'll cure you so you can act openheartedly.
[k]

＠Nightingale
I'll cure you so that you may whisper words of love to your wife. I'll cure you[line 4]so you can wield your sword and fight.
[k]

＠Nightingale
But for that, your body, your cells,[sr]must have the determination to recover.
[k]

＠Nightingale
If you lose willpower, muster it up again.[sr]Otherwise, I'll kill you myself.
[k]

＠Rama
...You know, you really are a Berserker!
[k]

[charaFace C 6]
＠Nightingale
You disapprove?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Rama
Not at all... I got it. I'll recover.[sr]I WILL recover. I have the desire to do so.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Rama
I refuse to die, not until my wish is fulfilled!
[k]

＠Nightingale
This is the final gate.[sr]Please hold out just a little longer.
