This girl[line 3]yes, Fran is an artificial human. Her[sr]physical composition was not of a spirit. She's not a Heroic Spirit.

[charaFace G 0]
＠Jekyll
She is a human living in this era.[sr]Wait, I guess artificial human.
[k]

＠Jekyll
Maybe the description in the novel was wrong...[sr]Though I can't be that positive about it.

You touched around her body insisting it was an[sr]inspection, and it made her unhappy. Apologize to her, Jekyll.

Most likely.

？1：Yes, that's what she said.

？2：How are you guys understanding her?

？！

[charaFace G 5]
＠Jekyll
How do you guys know what she thinks?[sr]Is it because you're the "same gender"... Oh, no, nothing!
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Next time, I will kill you.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Jekyll
Yes. Yup. Sorry. I'll never say it again. Anyway[line 3][sr]another case showed up in my info network.

Something strange appeared in the Soho area.[sr]Apparently it even slips indoors to assault civilians.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Let me confirm. The homunculi, automata,[sr]and Helter Skelters until now[line 3]
[k]

＠Jekyll
Have zero cases of entering buildings. At least not[sr]according to my information network and Saber's patrols.
[k]

＠Jekyll
What is entering buildings and attacking civilians[sr]appears to be a book as big as a human.
[k]

＠Jekyll
I decided to tentatively call them Magical Tomes.[sr]I want you to deal with this.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Jekyll
Whether this is related to "Project Demonic Fog" is[sr]uncertain, but at the very least, there have been victims in Soho.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Jekyll
I need your help.[sr]Will you do it?
[k]

？1：Leave it to me.

？2：It's no use staying still.

＠Mordred
Huge book... A Magical Tome, huh? A kind of monster[sr]that didn't exist in Britain back in my day.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The Britain when you were alive... Did monsters[sr]exist back in the times of the Arthurian legends?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
Of course. The Knights of the Round Table[sr]even fought dragons and giants.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Deep woods, steep mountains, bluffs with unceasing[sr]winds. Realms humans never cross are prime dens for Phantasmals.
[k]

＠Mordred
They come down to human dwellings every so often.[sr]And well, ordinary humans usually end up as their food.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Food, you say.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
Average soldiers are no match for demonic beasts,[sr]dragons, or Phantasmals. Even in your era, most weapons are useless.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
But there are exceptions.[sr]For Britain[line 3]it was the Knights of the Round Table.
[k]

＠Mordred
We fought well, and killed a reasonable number,[sr]you know? Battling a Phantasmal is pretty rough[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Oh, and them. Them...[sr]The Picts.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
In our time, they're seen as a very mysterious people.[sr]A tribe that once flourished mainly in Scotland, so we've heard.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
Well, rather than people, they were...[sr]Um...
[k]

＠Mordred
They weren't like any tribes or barbarians...[sr]They went far beyond any of them.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
Describing it in terms of your era, they were like[sr]something that would be in a sci-fi movie, you know?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
Aliens?[sr]Or, something like that. Yes, that's a close one.
[k]

？1：An Arthurian joke?

？2：Ah, that's a funny joke.

？！

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Yes, Senpai. I heard it as a joke, too.[sr]...Oh.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
Mordred, I...[sr]I'm sorry. I completely missed the timing to laugh.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Hmm, that was an Arthurian joke?[sr]So you're supposed to miss the timing... Hm, I see.
