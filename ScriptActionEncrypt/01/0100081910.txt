...Goetia, the name of the 72 Demon Gods combined...

A living summoning spell that hid itself inside King Solomon's corpse after his death...

Not just that... This Spirit Origin signature I'm seeing doesn't even belong to a Caster anymore. That is no longer King Solomon's body.
[k]

＠Mash
It's one of the seven Evils of Humanity: Beast I, a Beast of Disaster.

Correct. I was[line 2]no, WE were created by human hands.
[k]

＠Goetia
I am a higher-dimension being that no longer requires flesh and blood. I was granted greater powers than humans and once lived to serve them.
[k]

＠Goetia
But that is no longer the case.[sr]I am done with humans.

＠Goetia
Once, there was a king who was omnipotent and omniscient. He was given these powers by God.
[k]

＠Goetia
His eyes could see the past and future, and know all there was to know about the world. We became that man's shadow and saw what he saw.
[k]

＠Goetia
[line 3]No, as we were his guardian spirit, we had no choice but to synchronize with him.

＠Goetia
We saw much sadness.[sr]We saw many betrayals.
[k]

＠Goetia
We saw much pillaging.[sr]We saw many ends.
[k]

＠Goetia
We have seen enough, and will see no more. Even the gods can meet no end on this planet except through annihilation.
[k]

＠Goetia
We no longer care about humans or the future. What I seek is a perfect environment to raise a healthy sapient being.
[k]

＠Goetia
This planet was a mistake. It was madness, predicated on life with a fixed duration.
[k]

＠Goetia
I will reach the apex of it all.
[k]

＠Goetia
I shall go 4.6 billion years into the past, and bear witness to the moment when this celestial body was born. I shall absorb all its energy[line 3]
[k]

＠Goetia
And make myself into a new planet, to remake this world.
[k]

＠Goetia
I shall rewrite the book of Genesis, and create a world without the concept of death. That shall be our grand deed.
[k]

＠Goetia
We did not destroy mankind out of hatred.
[k]

＠Goetia
We needed the energy to venture to the past. We needed it to perform the infinite, instantaneous tuning necessary to control the birth of a planet.
[k]

＠Goetia
A plan like this requires a vast amount of magical energy. To be precise, 3,000 years' worth of the magical energy stored by all sapient beings.
[k]

＠Goetia
And so, by turning all of human history from 1000 B.C. to A.D. 2018 into magical energy, we would have acquired the necessary amount to journey to the beginning of this planet.
[k]

＠Goetia
That is the only reason for us to incinerate mankind.
[k]

＠Goetia
To us, humans are just fuel for a propulsion device that could launch us to the very beginning.
[k]

＠Goetia
Behold the Throne.[sr]That is the convergence of your lives.

Now then. I have shown you due respect.[sr]It is finally time for retaliation.

＠Goetia
As you heard, we are very busy.[sr]My true work is still waiting.
[k]

＠Goetia
Even creatures as foolish as you must find it frustrating when forced to revisit work you thought complete, yes?
[k]

＠Goetia
The time has come. The plan for the remaking of the planet is complete. And obviously, on this journey to the apex, you are unnecessary.
[k]

＠Goetia
I shall now perform my last task in this region, in this era, and on this Earth.
[k]

“Welcome, everyone. Now die.”[sr]The words that end this useless discussion.

Goetia, the King of Demon Gods, has entered a combat stance! If he uses those bands of light, we can't win!

We need to defeat him somehow before he uses his Noble Phantasm!
