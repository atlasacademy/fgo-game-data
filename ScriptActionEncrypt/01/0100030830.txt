I mean, you act totally carefree, but wherever you are,[sr]you're always gripping your gun warily.

This old man's really impressed.

＠F：???
After all, a genius who acts like a moron[sr]is more trouble than a moron calling himself a genius.

Sheesh. The plan was to let the Holy Grail fall into[sr]an idiot's hands, causing this era to fall apart.

＠Hektor
I can't believe that a voyager who exists only to stop[sr]that would appear. The Naval Chart of Mankind sure walks on a tightrope.
