Yes.[sr]I think we can settle down here.

＠Jeanne
First, please tell me your names.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Understood.[sr]My Individual Name is Mash Kyrielight.
[k]

＠Mash
This is [%1].[sr]My Master.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Master?[sr]So there are Masters even in this Holy Grail War.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
No, it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War.[sr]I am just a Demi-Servant.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
Demi-Servant?
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
Not a true Heroic Spirit.[sr]Have you heard of us?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
...Right.[sr]We should probably clear that up first.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
I am indeed a Servant, my class is Ruler.[sr]I understand that.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
But... A majority of information about the Holy Grail War that should be provided is missing.
[k]

＠Jeanne
No, not just information.[sr]My stats have ranked down as well.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Not only have I lost the anti-Servant Command Spells,[sr]I can't even reveal their True Names anymore.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
Luckily this is my homeland where I was born and raised.[sr]If nothing else I still speak the language...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
That soldier earlier was saying[sr]that Jeanne d'Arc turned into a "Dragon Witch".
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
... Having just materialized a few hours ago, I am not sure what's going on.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
It seems there is another Jeanne d'Arc in this world.
[k]

＠Jeanne
A Jeanne that murdered King Charles VII of France, and committed the slaughter at Orleans...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
So does that mean two of the same Servants have been summoned in the same era?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Hmm... If we could access the Holy Grail War's records, there should be examples of simultaneous summons.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Anyway, one thing is for sure.[sr]Charles VII is dead, and Orleans has been occupied.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Which symbolizes the collapse of the nation of France.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In history, France was the first nation to declare human[sr]liberty and equality. Many countries followed suit.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Delaying this by 100 years would stagnate civilization.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Without progress we might still be stuck in the Middle Ages.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jeanne
I just heard a voice... Is that magecraft?[sr]What in the world are you all[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Oh that's right, we didn't introduce ourselves.[sr]Nice to meet you, Saint Jeanne d'Arc.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
My name is Romani Archaman.[sr]Everyone calls me Roman.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I do various support tasks.[sr]Nice to meet you.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne
I see, Roman.[sr]You tend to be a dreamer!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...What is this sense of defeat?[sr]She complimented me, but I'm not happy at all...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Excuse me, Mademoiselle Jeanne.[sr]It's our turn now.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Our objective is the correction of this twisted history.[sr]We belong to an organization by the name of Chaldea.

＠Fou
Fou?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
I'm an incomplete Servant, and even I cannot trust "myself."
[k]

＠Jeanne
The Jeanne 'd'Arc that occupied Orleans...[sr]Not only that, but those flying dragons...
[k]

[charaFadeout C 0.1]

[charaFadein A 0.1 2]
＠Mash
You mean the wyverns... There is no way wyverns existed in the 15th century France.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
More importantly, he called you a "Dragon Witch".
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
Yes, I don't want to admit it, but the person controlling those dragons must be "myself."
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
I have no idea how she's controlling them.[sr]I never thought about such things during my life.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
Summoning dragons is the highest form of[sr]magecraft, let alone to have this many[line 2]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's an impossible feat for modern mages.[sr]It should be difficult even for this era's magecraft.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That means... [%1].[sr]If there's anything that could bend rules like this...
[k]

？1：...It's likely to be a Holy Grail?

＠Dr. Roman
Exactly. It's only speculation, but these are no longer someone else's problems.
[k]

？2：...Smooth over chunky?

＠Dr. Roman
You're still bringing that up?[sr]You're pretty vindictive, aren't you?
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
I see, there are still many unclear points, but I have an idea now.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Mademoiselle Jeanne.[sr]What are you going to do from here?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
...The objective is clear.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Head to Orleans, and take back the city. To do that, I must exterminate the Jeanne d'Arc who stands in my way.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
The Lord didn't show me the path, but I cannot turn my back on this.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Even alone, you will fight...[sr]She's just like history says, Master.
[k]

？1：Yeah, I thought so, too.

？2：A startling difference from Da Vinci.

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Master, and Doctor.[sr]Our objective and Ms. Jeanne's are the same.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I was thinking about our next course of action...[sr]How about we help her?
[k]

？1：Of course, I thought the same.

？2：I'd help even without a mission.

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Right. It's best to work together with Jeanne here.[sr]It's a rare honor to fight alongside a Saint and Savior!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Good. Then once again, Mademoiselle Jeanne.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
We have our own objectives, but we want to be of aid to you.
[k]

＠Mash
Will you allow us to fight under your flag as your companions from now on?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne
Oh... The pleasure will be all mine.[sr]I cannot possibly thank you enough.
[k]

＠Jeanne
...Thank you, Mash, [%1].[sr]I thought I would be in this fight all alone.
