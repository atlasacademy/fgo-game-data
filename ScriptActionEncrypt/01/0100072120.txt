You're back? Has it been half a day? Funny, it seems like it was just a moment ago. All right.

Take a look. This is Uruk in its entirety. One more step and it will be wiped off the land. The end of the world.

＠Gilgamesh
Who knows? The voice of that Beast does not seem to reach us. First off, does that thing even have a mind of its own?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
It's a mechanism that only exists to destroy the world.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
The moment it turned into an Evil of Humanity, I assume it ceased to be the Tiamat you knew through your father.
[k]

＠Ishtar
...Then how are we going to stop Mother? Unless she has someone she can take her hatred out on, there's no way.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
True. All of the things that Tiamat spawned, their evil should end once old Mesopotamia perishes.

＠Gilgamesh
I sent my friend off twice.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
The first time I was mourning. But this time is different. His proud, valiant figure is burned into my memory for eternity.
[k]

＠Ishtar
...Come on. That's not what I am talking about, dummy.

Well, that doesn't matter to me now... Perhaps it'd be a bit annoying if I was ONLY Ishtar...

All right! That's enough melodramatic speechifying from me!

...Humph. Finally, the true split with the gods...
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I certainly spouted quite a lot of nonsense, even for me. Well, I suppose that means I cannot remain behind.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Gilgamesh
Master of Chaldea. Do you remember our conversation about being consistent with human history?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Uruk's destruction is inevitable.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
But if Tiamat and the starting point of this Singularity, myself, were to disappear, that conclusion would be interpreted a bit differently.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
The only thing that will vanish would be the reign of Uruk's fifth king. The era after, the sixth king, should be alive and well.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Tiamat is not the only one who must be defeated. After this, I too will no longer be needed.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gilgamesh
My only fear was in how I would die. Suicide, as a king, is out of the question.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I was troubled over what to do, but now, as luck would have it, I am mortally wounded. I thank you, [%1].
[k]

？1：King Gilgamesh...
？2：...You're thanking me... for that...?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Gilgamesh
...Sometimes you are intolerable. That's not all I'm thanking you for. Do not make me say more, fool.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Traveler from another land. Etch this into your mind:
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Even if everything in this era had been called into service, I have a feeling it would have ended here.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
You are a foreigner, a foreign element in this period, and a surplus. However[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gilgamesh
That very surplus was the thing that helped us face destruction we alone could not have overcome, and helped us make our final move.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
...The time has come. I am leaving everything in your hands now.
