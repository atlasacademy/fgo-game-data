Hmm, well this is an altogether new problem. To think Quetzalcoatl would come barging in herself.

Really. She's a different class and uses different weapons. Other things like the amount of skin showing and our alignments are generally the same.

...Well, there's no denying that she's a nuisance.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Like the way she picks fights with humans one by one. She's got a weird idea of eradicating humanity, but I guess she'd call it integrity.
[k]

＠Ishtar
And, if she's coming tomorrow, that means she intends on killing one hundred people every day.

Eh? You're asking me!? You guys have Merlin over there!

Use that clairvoyance or whatever, and take a peek at what Quetzalcoatl is doing!

＠Merlin
I'd really like to do that, but I can't overuse my clairvoyance. I'm using my magical energy for other things right now.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Merlin
At any rate, she'll definitely pick up on it if I observe her.
[k]

＠Merlin
And as many a myth has shown, goddesses don't respond well to being peeked on. Isn't that right, Ishtar?

Yeah, I'd kill them. I'd use my Authority, my Noble Phantasm, everything I have, and blast wherever the peeper is to oblivion!

＠Merlin
See? Do you want to piss her off like that? I don't! And THAT'S why I can't use clairvoyance to check out Quetzalcoatl.

No wonder something seemed a bit off about you, Merlin. You had already done everything you could.

I'm glad you understand. So, Romani Archaman, what is your proposal?

[charaTalk B]
[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 5]
＠Dr. Roman
All right, I shall give my opinion as Chaldea's operations commander.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Currently, there is no way to intercept Quetzalcoatl. That said, we aren't in a condition to leave her alone.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Which means we have to get proactive. We strike at Quetzalcoatl's home base.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Originally, Quetzalcoatl was a goddess that had absolutely nothing to do with Sumer.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
So how is she demonstrating such heightened Divinity and Authority?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It must be because a temple dedicated to her worship was built somewhere.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The other day, when [%1] went to investigate Ur, there was a particularly strong magical energy response coming from the south.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even in a jungle full of mana, that response was so strong you knew it was special.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That must be Eridu, the city that King Gilgamesh was talking about. If Quetzalcoatl is occupying that city,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
we can assume that she has created a temple in her name there. To establish a temple, you need a symbol that represents the deity.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Quetzalcoatl is said to possess two treasures: the Jade Sword, Macana, and the Sun's Pilgrimage, Piedra del Sol.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Either of those would certainly work to establish her place of worship. So...
[k]

[communicationCharaClear]

[charaTalk D]

＠Ana
...Destroy the symbol, remove the temple's power, and diminish Quetzalcoatl's Divinity.
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Exactly, Ana. After that, if we face Quetzalcoatl, there is at least a small chance of victory.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And with Ishtar's help, we'd be more than a match for her.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Oh, you're relying on me?

＠Ishtar
I didn't want to fight other goddesses, but if it's [%1]'s request, I have no choice.
[k]

[charaFace F 6]
＠Ishtar
Of course, if it was a certain useless king asking, I'd just have laughed myself silly and refused!

I guess it's settled, then. [%1], I have a new mission for you.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I authorize the second stage of our goddess extermination plan! Go through the jungle and head to Eridu!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
There, defeat Quetzalcoatl, and also recover the divine tool stored in Eridu.
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠Gilgamesh
Retrieve Marduk's axe, the weapon that killed the goddess Tiamat!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Two days to reach Eridu, four days round trip!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Hurry! As soon as you return, we'll start preparations for the battle with Gorgon!
