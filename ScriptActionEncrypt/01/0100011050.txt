＠Georgios
A wyvern attack?[sr]There's been a lot of violence lately.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jeanne
No, that wasn't it.[sr]This sensation... It's the "Dragon Witch!"
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Georgios
What did you say?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
Let's retreat, Georgios![sr]We don't stand a chance against her right now!
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Georgios
...But we can't do that yet.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
Oh...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Georgios
The civilians aren't evacuated.[sr]The mayor has entrusted me with their protection.
[k]

＠Georgios
I must fulfill that wish[line 2][sr]Or else, I won't be able to stay a saint.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jeanne
But...
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

... I know.[sr]If I stay, I will die.

Lord Georgios, you are a man who is thick in head and body.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Georgios
What was that?
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Marie Antoinette
But, the part of you that is terribly cute has touched my heart.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
And so[line 3][sr]Please allow me to take over that duty.

＠Jeanne
What?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
I am the Queen of France.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Even though that is in the "future" from here, for me neither "past" nor "present" make much difference.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
Protecting the citizens is an important duty for me too, and you are now given a duty that can change everything.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
St. Georgios, go with Jeanne d'Arc and please lift the curse from the "Dragon Slayer."
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
In the name of Marie Antoinette, I will make sure to protect this city.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
P-Please wait up![sr]Wait, hey wait! Marie!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jeanne
Marie, let us stay and fight with you! You can't do[sr]it alone, but I am sure the two of us can[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Marie Antoinette
Non. That makes me very happy, but you cannot, Jeanne.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
I am sure I was summoned for precisely this moment.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Not to harbor hatred or defeat enemies, but to protect the people.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
So that at this time, I will protect those dear to me.[sr]To save my dear country, I will do what is right.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
Oh, but please apologize to Amadeus for me.[sr]I never got to hear him play after all.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Marie Antoinette
He was 6, and I was 7. Since then, we've passed each other, but never met.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jeanne
Marie!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

Lord Georgios, do you agree to this arrangement?

[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Now go, Jeanne. As short as our time was, it was the greatest honor to fight under your flag.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Yes.[sr]...I will be waiting.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
Don't worry, I'll catch up soon.

Sanson, you're here.

[charaFadein D 0.1 0]
＠Sanson
Of course I am. Execution needs qualifications.[sr]For both the executioner, and the executed.
[k]

＠Sanson
No other person has the right to execute you.[sr]You should have realized that Marie.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Marie Antoinette
...Let's see ...Hold on a second, Sanson.[sr]I know that you are a wonderful executioner.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
I mean, you're cruel, merciliess, and inhuman, but you never once mocked criminals.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
You guarded the guillotine with great respect, so I do indeed trust you.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
But, does that mean you alone hold the right to kill me?[sr]Isn't that a bit absurd?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Sanson
It's not absurd. I was born into a family of executioners, and I was only taught how to execute.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Sanson
No compromise. It's not only about dedication,[sr]I am particular about the method[line 3]the technique.
[k]

＠Sanson
It's natural for a good executioner to not inflict[sr]pain on the criminal. I see beyond that.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Sanson
I see the[line 3]ecstasy.[sr]The moment it feels so good that "it will kill you."
[k]

＠Sanson
That is the type of beheading I dedicate myself to.[sr]The best slice of my life was my "kiss" for you.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Sanson
So, this is destiny. I couldn't help but want to see you so I could ask...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Sanson
Please, tell me, Marie.
[k]

＠Sanson
How was my beheading?[sr]Were you able to climax at the very end?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
...I can see that you seriously showed respect for me Sanson, from the bottom of your heart.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
But, I'm sorry. That's just impossible.[sr]It's something that I cannot possibly say...
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
I already know enough men with perverse hobbies.[sr]Terribly sorry, but I can't accept a second kiss from you.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Sanson
Yes, I know. But I'm sure you will be delighted,[sr]I've gotten even better than back then.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Sanson
That is why I was summoned as a Servant.[sr]I shall give you the final ecstasy once again!
