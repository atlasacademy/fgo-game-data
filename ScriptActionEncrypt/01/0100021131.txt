From now on, let's protect our rearguard as well.[sr]The enemy seems to understand how our army works.

＠Dr. Roman
Did you sense any Servants?[sr]I couldn't detect anything from here.
[k]

＠Mash
There were no signs of such during the battle.[sr]Except for the four in our own forces. Oh wait...

＠Mash
Jing Ke often extinguishes her presence.[sr]So to be precise, that's three Servants.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's Assassin's Presence Concealment skill.[sr]I can't detect her from here, either.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I don't think an Assassin is involved.[sr]In this case[line 2]

I don't know.[sr]But we will find out soon.
