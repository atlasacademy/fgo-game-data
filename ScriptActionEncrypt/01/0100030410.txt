I've never run so much in my life.[sr]Why am I a Servant in the first place?

I don't see "myself" here[line 2][sr]Nor my "loser sister" either...

＠E：???
...No, even if that girl isn't here, I'm fine.[sr]I'm so fine in all sorts of ways...

[charaFace E 3]
＠E：???
Sigh...[sr]I wonder who I'm talking to.

[charaFace E 5]
＠E：???
In the first place, this maze is "that" labyrinth, right?[sr]There's no way...out of here... and no string.
[k]

＠E：???

Hmm?

Something the matter?

Yes, the air tastes different here.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Tastes...different?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
In different countries and lands, the air changes flavor.
[k]

＠Drake
The distance between England and France aside,[sr]when you travel to a new continent, the air really tastes differently.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Hmm. Perhaps Miss Drake can detect changes in the wind due to differences in temperature and currents?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Drake
What's this "Miss Drake" business? You sound[sr]creepy when you put it that way, Mister Scholar!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
S-Sorry.[sr]Please excuse me, Drake.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Mash, [%1].[sr]What Drake says may be correct.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Your current location has obvious different temperatures[sr]and currents than the previous island.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
With a little more time, I'm sure we can determine[sr]exactly where you are.
