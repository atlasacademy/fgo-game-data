I don't understand at all.[sr]This is the first time I've felt baffled.

＠Tiamat
Even with life as fragile as yours, you still have all of your limbs attached. That makes no sense at all.

I don't see any damage to Tiamat![sr]The second we wound her she regenerates!

Is that the Authority given to her in the Mesopotamian creation myth as mother of the Demonic Beasts!?

No, that's not an Authority of a goddess. She's regenerating from the Holy Grail's supply of magical energy.

I just confirmed it. That Servant has the King of Mages' Holy Grail!

Oh? It seems you have a knowledgeable one with you. That is indeed what I possess.

But don't make light of me. I am not using the Holy Grail's magical energy at all. I have manifested as the Goddess of Demonic Beasts...

＠Tiamat
I wouldn't use power from elsewhere to destroy the humans.
