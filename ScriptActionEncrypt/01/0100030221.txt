＠Mash
S-So powerful...[sr]This person is flesh and blood, right?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
W-Well, she should be.[sr]Thing is, I'm getting a magical energy reading from her.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
So she's either a mage[line 2]or a hero from birth?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Ahhhh! That hits the spot.[sr]Rum's got nothing on this, I'm telling you.

＠Pirate
Hey Boss! You all right?
[k]

＠Drake
Hahaha! What are you talking about?[sr]Of course I'm all right!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
That aside though...[sr]Seems that I lost.
[k]

＠Drake
You can boil me, fry me, sleep with me,[sr]anything you want!
[k]

？1：I'll pass.

？2：I'm good.

＠Mash
Master, I don't think you need[sr]to reply every time...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Oh? I see, I see.[sr]In that case, I guess it can't be helped.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
Anyway, a loss is a loss,[sr]I'll hear you guys out.
[k]

＠Drake
But, you know what?[sr]From the looks of it, you want a ride, don't you?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
You're looking for something, but are unfamiliar with these seas.[sr]That's why you need to rely on me, pirate or not.
[k]

？1：You being a pirate is irrelevant.

？2：We need you, Francis Drake.

？！

[charaFace D 3]
＠Drake
I see.[sr]...Hmm, hah, so that's it.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
So? What exactly do you want from us?[sr]We lost, so we'll give you anything other than our lives.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...First, we must understand the situation.[sr]"Where" exactly are we?
[k]

＠Mash
England? Or closer to Spain, perhaps?[sr]Or are we in the Caribbean?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
Uhh, sorry.[sr]Come to think of it, we don't know either.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
So all that revelry and you don't even know!?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Right, because there's no shortage of food or booze.
[k]

＠Drake
All right. Now that we've surrendered to you,[sr]we're officially part of your crew!
[k]

＠Drake
How about we start off with a toast!
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
H-Hey, wait a sec...
[k]

＠Drake
C'mooon, it's fine, it's all good.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
It's NOT good![sr]Hey, what are you... No, wait! Master, save me!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Hm?[sr]What are these readings...
[k]

？1：What's up?

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Nah, must be an error.[sr]I'll make some adjustments.
