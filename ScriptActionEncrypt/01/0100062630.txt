...Sorry. I must apologize to you, King Ozymandias. That was bad of me just now...
[k]


？1：Sanzang apologized!?
？2：Now of all times!?

＠Sanzang
...And that's why I'm going to get serious now. If you'd go so far as becoming an ugly monster, then I must answer your resolve.

He told me to stop, told me I was abusing its use. But now...

＠Sanzang
This is not, because that is not. This ceases to be, because that ceases to be.

The time has come to unleash the Buddha Palm! Now, I will save this entire world!
