...Master. I can see the shadows of multiple sphinxes beyond that particularly tall sand dune there.
[k]

＠Mash
They are circling that area as if monitoring it, so the ruin we're looking for must be right in front of us, but...

The problem is what to do about them all?[sr]Taking on that many would be reckless.

We'll have to find another way to enter. Although it's easier said than done, in this sandstorm...

Unfortunately, sphinxes only feed on spirits...

The reason they attack humans is not for nutrition, but to be in accordance with the laws that govern them...

I see... Despite appearances, they're actually herbivores, or rather, soulivores... No need to count calories... Lucky...

I've caught up to you.[sr]This is the third time I'm stirring up trouble with you.
[k]

＠H：???
The first was when you were chased from the Holy City. The second was at the village of the mountain people.
[k]

＠H：???
Neither time was I granted my wish of facing the rebels' leader. ...But that all changes now.

Sir Lancelot. For what reasons are you serving the current king?

(Just because Bedivere broke away from the Round Table... Don't you think they're overreacting?)

＠Bedivere
Even if I am an illusion, it does not change the reality of my question.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Bedivere
Answer me, Sir Lancelot. Why did a knight like you choose to serve the Lion King?
[k]

＠Bedivere
Sir Gawain believes the king no matter what. Sir Mordred said the mere act of opposing the king is sacrilege.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Tristan asserted... that the king's commandments are merciful actions.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

How about you? Can you call that light, that folly of burning a village to the ground, King Arthur's job!?

...You are correct, I would not call that the king's work! I swore allegiance to the King of Knights, not the Lion King!

But that has nothing to do with my duty to capture you! Air your grievances in front of His Majesty himself!
