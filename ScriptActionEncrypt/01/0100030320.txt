＠Drake
By the way.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Yes?
[k]

＠Drake
What do you think are in these waters, anyway?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
If what the doctor says is true,[sr]there might be a treasure here.
[k]

＠Mash
But... That means these waters are basically the same[sr]as those in the Age of Exploration.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...Which means Drake isn't the only pirate[sr]going after the treasure.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Ahah! That gets me all fired up![sr]First come, first served. How simple is that?

But Boss,[sr]we don't have any leads on that treasure.

[charaFace D 5]

Fool.[sr]We're going to start by finding those leads.
[k]

＠Pirate
...Boss![sr]An island in sight! East-northeast of here!

Yes. I'm detecting Servants on that island.

Captain Drake. That island has those[sr]superhumans you mentioned before.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
Please have all the pirates retreat. The only ones[sr]who can fight them are myself, Senpai, and you.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Drake
Already? Well, you guys are with me this time.[sr]Hey scumbags, protect the ship!
[k]

＠Drake
[%1] and I are gonna go[sr]check things out!

We need to proceed with caution, Master.[sr]We still don't know if the Servant is a friend or foe...

Hmm... Over there, perhaps?

No. But I felt a vague presence, so I took a shot.

"Vague?" "Took a shot!?"

If you get a bad feeling, fire first, ask later.[sr]That's the key to survival, you know?

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
How violent...[sr]That's how an outlaw thinks!
[k]

？1：So, did it hit?

？2：Did you get it?

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Hah! You won't know until you look for yourself![sr]I'll go see if it's dead or not.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
At any rate, there goes our plan to proceed with caution.[sr]Senpai, what should we do?
[k]

？1：Let's calm down.

？2：Let's play it by ear.

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...Yes.[sr]I will calm down and play it by ear.
[k]

＠Drake
Hey! Mash, [%1]![sr]Come over here!

A... Stone tablet?
[k]

＠Drake
That's right. Can you read what's written on it?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
It[line 2]appears to be runes of some sort.[sr]Doctor, can you decode it?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I see, I see, these are relatively new runes.[sr]I'd say they were carved within the last week.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Um, Da Vinci?[sr]That's my job, yes? Don't take my job, okay?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Let's see here...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
"Bloodaxe King, once laid to rest, shall awaken once more."
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...That's the general gist of it.[sr]But, Bloodaxe King? Why does that sound familiar[line 2]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Th-The Bloodaxe King is the name of the Viking king[sr]that ruled Norway in the 9th century!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Be careful. I'm picking up readings similar[sr]to those copied pirates from that stone tablet!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Enemies?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
...Yeah, it appears so. I'm getting a very bad vibe here.[sr]Mash, [%1]!
