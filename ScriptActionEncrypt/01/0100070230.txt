You should be careful. They may look beautiful, but they're actually a weapon forged to kill humans.

＠Mash
It's probably... because of discrepancies in the legends about Merlin.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Merlin is the fabled mage from the Isle of Britain who primarily appears in Arthurian legend.
[k]

＠Mash
It was his help that guided King Arthur[line 2][sr]Altria Pendragon[line 2]to the throne.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Afterward, he served as King Arthur's court mage and adviser, and appeared in many tales.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
But due to his womanizing habits, he was driven from Britain and eventually ended up in the utopia of Avalon.
[k]

＠Mash
After repenting his wicked ways[line 2]his sins[line 2]he was imprisoned in a tower there. A tower he built himself.
[k]

＠Mash
He punished himself by watching over the world in the cramped tower, never dying.
[k]

＠Mash
Both Avalon and the tower Merlin is trapped inside exist outside of time, and will only disappear when history ends.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
So, Merlin is still alive. And no one who's alive can become a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Mash
I think that's what the Doctor is trying to point out.
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 5]
＠Dr. Roman
That's right, Mash. Merlin is a hero who isn't counted as a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Though it is possible he could be summoned by some kind of irregularity, like Scáthach...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But in terms of combat, he's completely useless!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
All Casters with the potential to be a Grand Caster are powerful clairvoyants. Solomon's eyes, for instance, can see the past and future.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
King Gilgamesh can see the future. And that scoundrel in front of you can see everything in the present.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Some can see more clearly or further than others, but all possess the power as observers.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But their superpower is basically magic sight.[sr]And Merlin's the worst of them!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He's nothing more than a magical telescope!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The only thing Merlin can do is view the entire world from the Tower of Avalon.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
In the modern world, it'd be like having the power to look into any computer network[line 3]Oh[communicationCharaFace 2].

The Incineration of Humanity destroyed the world, but Avalon, where you are, is still standing.

The reason and the method. Unless you tell us these two things, we can't trust you.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
After all, Enkidu just attacked us.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Based on the search plan Chaldea made, Enkidu was our most trusted candidate for navigator.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But then Enkidu turned around and betrayed us almost immediately.
[k]

We certainly can't put our guard down around another newcomer who seems to be friendly... You can see why Romani's worried.

[charaFace E 0]
＠Merlin
I can, however, tell you the method.[sr]It's very simple, Da Vinci.
[k]

＠Merlin
This Singularity manifested in an age that predates my appearance on Earth. In other words, my body doesn't exist here.
[k]

＠Merlin
Which means that in this world, it could theoretically be said that I am dead.
[k]

I used that fact to make myself a Servant. Part of it was that I was called forth by a strong summoner.
