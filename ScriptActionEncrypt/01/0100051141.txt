When participating in a Holy Grail War as Servants,[sr]either he or I get summoned as Rama.

We are never summoned simultaneously. Even in Holy Grail Wars, we are fated to never meet again.

You don't want something like that?[sr]This man betrayed you once before, right?

This man fought for 14 years, for my sake.

He faced Ravana, even though we had only lived together for a year.
