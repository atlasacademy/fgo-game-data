？！

[charaFace F 1]
＠Sanzang
Oh my, right back at you. Where's Mash? Are you out for a walk without her?
[k]

＠Sanzang
I'm doing my daily writing. I'm making note of what happened today in a scroll.
[k]

＠Sanzang
One day this will be “Monk Sanzang's Tortuous Travels,” the hundred-volume set, stored in Chalde...no, the temple.
[k]


？1：Those will be the sutras that touch people's hearts.

[charaFace F 3]
＠Sanzang
Huh? R-Really? You think they'll be? I hope they'll be, of course, but... Teeheehee.
[k]


？2：Scrolls... collect... Bajie... uuh, my brain...

[charaFace F 1]
＠Sanzang
What, you've gone on a scripture-collecting journey before? Tell me next time, it must've been fun.

？！

[charaFace F 1]
＠Sanzang
My hopes for tomorrow? Ah, like my fighting spirit?! Leave it to me. I'm roarin' and ready to go!
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Sanzang
...Yeah, that's right. Come to think of it, Mash and I had this sort of discussion once, too.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Sanzang
Back then, I didn't know much about the Lion King or King Ozymandias.
[k]

＠Sanzang
So I couldn't decide whose side to take, which side was correct.
[k]

＠Sanzang
That's why I decided to take your guys' side. Because you were the easiest to understand, [%1].
[k]


？1：...So that's why.
？2：...Then, what about now?

？！

[charaFace F 0]
＠Sanzang
Now I know for sure. I'm still on your side, [%1], but...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Sanzang
I will fight the Lion King, for my own principles. I'll be sure to destroy the sacred lance, you watch.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Sanzang
Hey, [%1]?
[k]

＠Sanzang
People aren't all equal, but they all have a path to the Buddha. They all have possibility.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Like the lotus that blooms in the mud. Like those who nurture a beautiful heart, unrecognized by others.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I won't approve a way of life that plucks off those blossoms.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Sanzang
Because, if they say there's no need for me because I keep screwing up, I'll never become a Buddha!
[k]


？1：That's so like you, Sanzang.
？2：...You're exactly right.

？！

[charaFace F 0]
＠Sanzang
Yeah, so leave it to me! I've got some special Buddhist punishments up my sleeve to make sure the Lion King sees the light!
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Sanzang
And... and also... if we save this era, er...
[k]

＠Sanzang
As a reward... can I also... in Chaldea...
[k]


？1：?

？！

[charaFace F 0]
＠Sanzang
...No, nothing. I'll save the fun stuff for later.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Sanzang
Good night, then, [%1].
[k]

＠Sanzang
When it's all over, I'll let you be my disciple, so you'd better look forward to it, okay!?

In that case, I won't have anything else to do. I'll look after the mountain people's lives for a while.

Fine, fine. I do owe you for helping me out before. Da Vinci will keep Sir Lancelot company.

[charaFace G 5]
＠Da Vinci
By the way, how are we getting through the main gates? Wanna blast it with my Noble Phantasm?
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Lancelot
...That is the problem. Camelot's main gates cannot be broken so easily.
[k]

＠Lancelot
Those gates render ill-intentioned attacks and evil powers ineffective. Even a sacred sword with the highest firepower would not make a dent.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Da Vinci
Dear me. Then, should we ignore the main gates?
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Lancelot
We will build a scaffold and climb over the walls into the castle. That is the most realistic plan. King Ozymandias' divine beasts will be attacking from the western side of the Holy City as well.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Lancelot
Even if we cannot break through the front gates, it will be ideal to knock down a portion of the wall...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Da Vinci
If the Holy City is the Lion King's sacred lance itself, even knocking down the castle wall won't go so easily, I'd think...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Yes, I wonder what the Raider Knights will do? What about Mordred's units?
[k]

＠Lancelot
My units will handle that. Mordred's knights are not so proficient.
[k]

＠Lancelot
Attacking head-on once or twice should clean them up. Then we will also assist in scaling the wall.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Da Vinci
Hm... that seems best.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[%1] and I will wait near the castle wall. We'll wait for your arrival while protecting the allied forces.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Once we get inside, we'll head straight for the king's castle. There'll be nothing left to fear, except maybe the Knights of the Round Table.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Da Vinci
Those still stuck in the Holy City are Sir Tristan and Sir Agravain. It'll be battle after battle, but we'll just have to manage.
[k]

[charaFace H 6]
＠Lancelot
...Agravain, hm? That man for certain will be aware of what we are up to.
[k]

＠Lancelot
The allied forces of the mountain, desert, and Holy Land peoples have grown exponentially. It is not something we can keep hidden.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Lancelot
Agravain is the kind of man to already have caught on to us.
[k]

＠Lancelot
Yet, there has been no developments by the Holy City. He has not told the Lion King about the existence of the allied forces.
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Lancelot
...Most likely. He must be planning to use us to weaken the Lion King's power.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Lancelot
The Lion King's objectives and his objectives are separate things. Agravain is only acting out of his own self-interest.
[k]

＠Lancelot
He manipulated King Arthur from the shadows. He controlled the government both here and in Britain.
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Lancelot
...The one I should put to death is that man. Without that man, the Lion King would not have gone insane!
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Da Vinci
Hmm. I'm not sure you're right about that.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Lancelot
What!?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If Agravain was really only acting out of his own self-interest, I don't think it would've come to this.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The Holy City would've become an over-compartmentalized bureaucracy, full of useless functions that we could've used to our advantage.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But there are no such holes in the Holy City. There are no power-hungry members. And because it's such an unbelievable city, it can't ever be brought down from the inside.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Da Vinci
I see Consul Agravain's deep-seated hatred in this. He's, how would I call it...
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Da Vinci
Remaining close to the Lion King with a terrible anger and spite. That's the sense I get.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Lancelot
Spite... In that man as cold as anger, who's disinterested in everything?

There was a terrible explosion, and rubble came falling down... and I lost all feeling in the lower half of my body.

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
I knew I wouldn't last another two minutes. I could calculate it exactly. ...To be honest, it was terrifying.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Because when I thought about what I could do with the little time I had left, I knew there was nothing.
[k]

＠Mash
...But.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I had someone who held my hand. Inside those flames, I had someone who helped me.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...Of course, it was impossible to save me. That person was clearly aware of that, too.
[k]

＠Mash
Unlike me, that person was someone who valued their own life. Afraid of dying, that person's knees were trembling.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
Yet, that person thought of me. Because of me, that person would end up dying, too...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

So that I wouldn't feel that way, that person smiled and held my hand.
[k]

＠Mash
...That person couldn't change the fact that I would die before their eyes.
[k]

Then, until that final moment, that person believed that comforting me was the best thing to do.

I know now. The person Heroic Spirit Galahad approved of wasn't only me.
[k]

＠Mash
He trusted that Senpai and I... He believed in the goodness of humans, that could do such acts.
[k]

＠Mash
I wasn't rescued. Something was entrusted to me. That I should live for people like that.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...That is why I fight, even if I'm afraid. For that beautiful moment I witnessed, I fight...
[k]

＠Mash
For thanks to that wonderful miracle, I am still alive.

[k]

＠Mash
I'm still... scared of combat, and...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Bedivere
No. That's not it.
[k]

＠Bedivere
When I heard you were a Demi-Servant, I thought you were the same as me.
[k]

＠Bedivere
That you and I were both a “counterfeit.” That we both felt scarcely allowed to breathe.
[k]

＠Bedivere
...But you were different. Even if your path to becoming a Heroic Spirit was irregular, your conduct as one is the real thing.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
A counterfeit? You?
[k]

[charaFace B 10]
＠Bedivere
Well, no, it's just a metaphor. Because my Noble Phantasm is an imitation, a fake.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I am without a doubt Bedivere, Knight of the Round Table. Even if I sometimes wish I weren't.

＠Bedivere
I...
[k]

＠Bedivere
I committed a crime. An unforgiveable crime, at that.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Bedivere
To atone for that, I came all this way. I have sacrificed many things for that.
[k]

＠Bedivere
...That is what happened this time as well. I left [%1] in the desert.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Bedivere
It was more important for me to head for the Holy City than to bother with your distressed circumstances.
[k]

＠Bedivere
And I did the same thing at the gates of the Holy City. To meet the king, I hid my face with my robe, and continued to look down.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Bedivere
...When the Holy Selection began, and many people were being killed, I did not raise my face.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I wasn't trembling from anger at the violence.
[k]

＠Bedivere
All I was thinking of at that time was how to invade the Holy City.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Bedivere
...It was then, that I heard the sounds of battle.
[k]

＠Bedivere
An unknown mage and a girl knight broke through the knights' enclosure to let the people escape.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Bedivere
That was something I should have done. At least, the old me would have done the same.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Ah... What am I doing? After all this traveling, how pitiful have I become?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Bedivere
Irritated by such thoughts, I blindly swung my sword. I need not remind you what happened next.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I joined you and the unknown mage, [%1].
[k]

＠Bedivere
Figuring that would be the fastest way to my destination.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I didn't cooperate with you for your sakes. I only used you, for my own purposes.
[k]

＠Bedivere
There's no way that I can call myself the same as you.

That is what I have been living for all this time. Yet now, near the end, I am afraid of death.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Bedivere
It has been a difficult journey...
[k]

＠Bedivere
But because it has been difficult, what if the salvation does not measure up to it when it is over?
[k]

＠Bedivere
...When I thought about that, I was so afraid I couldn't stand. I am terrified of a meaningless ending...

There's no way the ending of this journey you sought will be meaningless, Sir Bedivere.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Because you... must've been able to end it whenever you liked.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
But you didn't. No matter how difficult and terrifying it was, you've come this far.
[k]

＠Mash
And it's because it wasn't a journey for yourself, it was a journey for others.
[k]

＠Mash
Even if you were scared, you weren't a coward.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
That's why... I'm sure there'll be a meaning to the end of this journey. A final salvation that measures up to the long path you've walked.

Haha, that is true. Then here is a bit of advice from me, as your senior.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Bedivere
Mash. Your Noble Phantasm's true nature is to protect people. But are you not mistaking it as one that “blocks attacks”?
[k]

＠Bedivere
Focus your mind on the people you should be protecting, rather than repelling the enemy's attacks.
[k]

＠Bedivere
That is your shield's, no, a Knight of the Round Table's true nature. That is the path, not to the fake Camelot built on that Holy Land,
[k]

＠Bedivere
But the path to the real pure white castle that will never crumble.
