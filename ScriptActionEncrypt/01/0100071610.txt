A massive amount of magical energy signatures is emerging from the Persian Gulf.

＠Dr. Roman
And they are spreading across all of Mesopotamia at incredible speeds.

＠Da Vinci
Okay. We've observed close to a hundred million of these life forms. Only a fraction of them have emerged from the ground.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
A rough search shows us that there are about 100,000 right now. Of those, around 20,000 are heading for Uruk.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
ETA is under three hours. At this rate, Uruk will be under attack in less than half a day.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Eridu has already been attacked. Ur has about an hour.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Assuming some of them drop in on Lagash, Girsu, and Umma along the way, I estimate about 10,000 will reach Uruk.

You guys should head for the Northern Wall. That's where Quetzalcoatl and Jaguar Warrior are.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Also, right now the Northern Wall is ironically the safest place in Mesopotamia, since it's furthest from the Persian Gulf.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I bet a lot of people will be gathering there.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Who knows how many people will arrive, but the Northern Wall will remain the most important fortification. We have to protect it.

＠Dr. Roman
Merlin disappeared. I believe his true body was killed.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As an incubus, he was one of the few mages who could meddle in the collective unconscious of intelligent beings while they were sleeping.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I bet Merlin used that ability to stay in Tiamat's slumbering mind for a long time.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He was probably keeping her asleep. Only an apparition of him was with you, [%1].
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But now his true body has been killed.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He would've been more or less invincible in a sleeper's deep dream, but that ability has one fatal flaw: REM sleep.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If the sleeper's consciousness becomes partially awake, all of the dream world will turn against the invader.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
When Gorgon died, that consciousness stirred. Half-awake, it was able to capture and obliterate Merlin.
