＠Fionn
Very well. It's finally time to settle this![sr]Will we get married or not? Let's begin the fight!
[k]

＠Diarmuid
My King, please don't let your guard down on account of your bride's beauty. She is already a powerful foe. Please give up this talk of marriage.

＠Fionn
Hahahaha! A shame, but of course, Diarmuid![sr]Did you think we could defeat them whilst holding back?

To battle the strong.[sr]To carve away at life and soul.
