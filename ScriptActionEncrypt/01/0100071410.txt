Even gods must remain in the underworld once they die.

I went down to the underworld because I was arrogant.

In the myths surrounding me, I was spoiled, praised, and knew no fear.

Yup. Ereshkigal's soul cages. Souls trapped in there can never return to the world of the living.

＠Ishtar
When the physical body dies, the soul starts to fade, then disappears. But Ereshkigal doesn't let that happen.

[charaFace C 10]

She cages up the souls of humans she likes, and keeps them at her side to enjoy for tens of thousands of years.
