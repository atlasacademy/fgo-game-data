？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Quetzalcoatl
Oh, you mean the cylinder seal I showed you at Eridu? Yes, I knew about Tiamat.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
And that Gorgon had synchronized with her consciousness, and had convinced herself she was Tiamat's second coming.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Quetzalcoatl
But I was a bad goddess. So I couldn't tell you or Gorgon the truth, no.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
I wanted to be Gorgon's friend, though.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
That cylinder was the most I could tell you. It was my way of saying, “Be careful, there's more to come.”
[k]

？2：You didn't tell us for Gorgon's sake?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Quetzalcoatl
Well...
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
...Yes. For that one time, I was on Gorgon's side, not humanity's.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
I wanted you - no, all of humanity - to truly hate her. I wanted you all to go up against her with everything you had.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
If you'd known Gorgon was a fake, and the true threat lay behind her, you would have pitied her and taken her lightly.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
I didn't want that to happen. That's why I couldn't just come out and tell you.

Senpai is at the embassy. [&He:She] wants to clean [&his:her] room one last time.

By this time tomorrow, either Uruk will be gone, or you'll have beaten Tiamat and be heading back to your own era.

[charaFace D 12]
＠Mash
That's... No, I can't say for sure...
[k]

[charaFace D 13]
＠Mash
but I don't think Senpai is thinking about Uruk being destroyed. I don't think [&he:she]'s sad about leaving either.
[k]

＠Mash
It's probably just a natural gesture to show gratitude. We've stayed in this town longer than any other before.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Ishtar
So it's not about getting attached. It's just something normal for a human to do...
[k]

＠Ishtar
You two must have gone through a whole lot of goodbyes. You don't see them as something to mourn.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Goodbyes are always going to come. You can't get through life if they make you sad all the time.
[k]

＠Ishtar
So you send them off with as much appreciation as you can. And rejoice in the fact that you met, and that you lived to say goodbye.
[k]

[charaFace E 7]

...Your Order's a good journey.

I finally understand why Gilgamesh is so nice to you.

That was “nice”?
[k]

[charaFace E 9]
＠Ishtar
Wow... Ignorance is scary... I mean, right now he's acting weirdly like a wise king,
[k]

＠Ishtar
but he was never the kind of person who'd make a plan that relies on other people.
[k]

[charaFace E 8]

He's a brutal person at his core. He'll kill without a second thought, without the slightest regard for someone's circumstances or feelings.

[charaFace E 7]

He was, well, you know, pretty cool back then? Just like in your legends.

There's nothing to be ashamed of in fearing battle. It's about taking lives. Of course it's scary.

Just as some people are more suited to certain weapons, there are those who are more suited to certain approaches to fighting.

Mash, you are not the type who can swallow fear during a fight, or get used to it.

That fear will follow you your entire life.

[k]

[charaFace D 3]

Hold back fear with courage...? Um, are you that way too, Leonidas?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Leonidas
Hahaha. Unfortunately, I fear only the dead. I am a king, after all.
[k]

＠Leonidas
I've been trained since a very young age not to feel fear in battle.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Mash
Oh, I'm sorry... It's none of my business...
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Leonidas
No, it's fine. It's true that I don't feel fear in battle...
[k]

＠Leonidas
But I always feared going into battle. Leaving my country behind. Even to protect it.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Leonidas
When I thought of the lives I was leaving behind, I gripped my spear so tightly I could crush it.
[k]

＠Leonidas
The worst of all was at Thermopylae.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Leonidas
The Persian enemy had 100,000 soldiers. And we only had three hundred Spartans.
[k]

＠Leonidas
We were just a tiny part of the 7,000-strong Greek alliance.
[k]

＠Leonidas
If we fought, we would be destroyed. But we were told if we surrendered and allowed the Persians to pass, they would spare Sparta.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Sparta was just a waypoint on their journey. Their true target was Athens, you see.
[k]

＠Leonidas
But if we failed to stop them, Athens was doomed.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Leonidas
It could only be for a single day, or perhaps a few more. But our tiny resistance could perhaps save the great kingdom of Athens.
[k]

＠Leonidas
To choose faith, or to choose life. I didn't know which was right. And I felt a fear greater than ever before.
[k]

＠Leonidas
To leave my wife and child for certain death.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Leonidas
I was beyond fearing my own death, but I was not used to fearing for my family's future.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Mash
...But you went to war anyway.
[k]

＠Mash
And somehow you held back the 100,000 Persian soldiers for several days with only a few hundred... And died.
[k]

[charaFace D 7]
＠Mash
...Was that because you went into battle afraid?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Leonidas
No. I only went to battle when I conquered my fear. I was given a divine message, Mash.
[k]

＠Leonidas
In my uncertainty, I prayed for guidance from the gods. And I received it.
[k]

＠Leonidas
“If you go to war, you will never return to Sparta,” I was told.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Mash
...
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Leonidas
That rid me of my uncertainty. I knew I would be able to fight like before, without hesitation or fear.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Mash
Wh-why? Even though you were told you would not come back?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Leonidas
I was not told that it would be meaningless to fight. And that meant that even if we lost, Sparta would not fall.
[k]

＠Leonidas
We would not return from the battlefield. But those deaths would have meaning.
[k]

＠Leonidas
I realized that even if we never came back, our battle was going to protect those who would come later.
[k]

＠Leonidas
And then I finally realized...
[k]

＠Leonidas
It gave me the strength not to swallow my fear, but to replace it with hope.
[k]

＠Leonidas
I bragged about this to my comrades: “Bet you didn't know that, did you?” I said.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Leonidas
“Everybody but you has been doing that this whole time. You're impressing no one.”
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Leonidas
Hahaha. All three hundred of us started laughing. I really was a bit of a dolt.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Until that last battle, I'd never realized the source of my comrades' strength.
[k]

＠Leonidas
...No. At the very last moment, I was finally able to realize.
[k]

＠Leonidas
If we - if I - caused a miracle at The Hot Gates, it was thanks to that.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Leonidas
Listen to me, Mash Kyrielight.
[k]

＠Leonidas
The reason you fear battle is because you know many things you care about.
[k]

＠Leonidas
The more of those things there are, the more you overcome that fear, the stronger your heart becomes.
[k]

＠Leonidas
That will be your greatest weapon. As long as your heart does not break with fear[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

Nothing will ever stain your shield. You will never be defeated.

You're observing the planet. Just like the light of the stars in the night sky.
[k]

＠Ishtar
There you can see the life of another person who shined in the distant past, separated by thousands of years.

＠Ishtar
A story of the stars in the sky, and of this land. Weaving those together is what you, what Chaldea does.

At that point, I foresaw the future and told my people:

“Uruk will be destroyed in six months. This doom cannot be averted.”

But you saved the people of Uruk, had compassion for this land, and chose to fight the goddesses.
[k]

And this was the result. You saved the lives of five hundred people who were fated to die.

This is about Humanity and the Singularities. You've traveled through six Singularities so far.

You must have fought many battles in the Singularities.

But when the Grail is recovered and the Foundation of Humanity is restored, all the damage from that Singularity is erased[line 3]

[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Gilgamesh
That's not it. That's not it at all. It's just made to match.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
For example, let's say a dragon kills someone. And then you make the Singlularity disappear. The Incineration of Humanity is prevented.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Gilgamesh
Even then, that person is still dead.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Gilgamesh
Instead of being killed by a dragon, history will remember them as having been killed by some beast.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Uruk is the same. Even if you defeat Tiamat and remove the Singularity...
[k]

[charaFace G 3]

The first dynasty of Uruk will fall. All that changes is the explanation: whether it was at the gods' hands, or it simply deteriorated.

The citizens were so sick of their absent king that they all went to other cities. Only Siduri was left.

I realized that was unworthy of a true king, and decided to rebuild Uruk, since I was in search of a new goal anyway.
