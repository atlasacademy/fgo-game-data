This is the secret mountain village? It's magnificent!

＠Bedivere
But... But we couldn't see it from up in the mountains... How can you do this without a Bounded Field!?

That's the wisdom of the mountain people. They learned how to conceal themselves in the mountains.

Unless you're familiar with these parts, it's impossible to find this place.
[k]

＠Arash
The reason Cursed Arm didn't want to show you it... is to make sure its location remains hidden.

Ah, that makes sense. The village lacks magical protection, so if it were discovered... Well, it'd all be over.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...Plus it looks like they have it rough here. They may not be starving, but... there's no breathing room either.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Still, the people who live here have not given up on their feelings for the Holy Land.

These mountain people... The knights in the Holy City... They're like oil and water.

I am not a knight of the Lion King, but I am related to the Round Table.

Don't sweat it too much. The guys here don't hold prejudices just because your beliefs are different.

Probably a result of the harsh life. We can tell those who had rough journeys at a single glance.

Mr. Knight... Your different appearance and status aside, the way you live your life struck a chord with the residents here.

...Hmm. So, you just happened to be headed in the same direction, eh...
[k]

？1：Meaning what?

？！

[charaFace H 0]

Meaning the two of you don't share goals. Even if they do happen to align for now...

No matter. In any case, I welcome you. Thanks for making the long journey over.

You're going to be in this village for a while, right? It's the perfect place to evade the Knights of the Round Table.

As long as you're here, you'll be safe. Plus you can collect some intel as well.

It's a bit unsettling around the village. Bandits and monsters roam about.

＠Arash
If you can defeat them, the villagers would feel much more at ease. You'll gain their trust, and feel great!

＠Arash
I think it's a win-win. What do you say? Care to go on a hunt with me?
