＠Marie Antoinette
[line 2]Phew.[sr]All right, are we safe now?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Doctor?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yes. I'm not detecting them anymore.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
While we're at it, I'm picking up leyline readings from that nearby forest.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Very well.[sr]Jeanne? And...Marie?
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Marie Antoinette
Marie, did you say?

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
F-Forgive me.[sr]Um[line 2]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
You weren't being rude! You made me so happy![sr]The way you addressed me was so adorable!
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Please, splendid foreigner![sr]Would you mind calling me that from now on?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Uh, yes...[sr]Miss Marie, or Mademoiselle Marie, perhaps?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Marie Antoinette
Nope, that won't work at all.[sr]Just Marie! Like the sheep!
[k]

？1：I'm pretty sure that was 'Mary'...

？2：Nice to meet you, Marie.

？！

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
Yes! Yes, yes, yes![sr]Nice to meet you! I'm Marie!
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
I love understanding [&gentlemen:ladies]. Let me guess.[sr]You're very popular with the opposite sex, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
...Marie, may I speak?
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Marie Antoinette
Oh, my apologies.[sr]I got excited for a minute. How rude of me.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
So, how may I be of service?

＠Mash
A strong leyline was detected in a nearby forest.[sr]I'd like to head there and make camp...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Is that all right, everyone?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
Of course, that's fine.[sr]Is that all right with you, Amadeus?
