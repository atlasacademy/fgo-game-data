If I answer, I will endanger Gilles's position.[sr]For now, we can't depend on them.

At the very least, we must endure the scorn of those who once fought by our side.

I don't know. I don't know, but...re-examine[sr]everything we know of the Dragon Witch.

Was it truly Jeanne d'Arc who attacked Charles VII?[sr]Or some evil imposter?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Gilles
It's possible... That there may be two Jeanne d'Arcs in this world.
