＠Drake
So... What?[sr]You guys came for this magical tankard...
[k]

＠Drake
I mean the Holy Grail?[sr]You can go back to your country if you have this?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...Yes.[sr]Well, that's it, more or less.
[k]

＠Drake
Hmm. Well, I can't deny that I lost to you,[sr]and I even said I'd give you anything but my life.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Here, take it. You came here from a distant era, right?[sr]Thanks for making the trip.

＠Mash
Th-Thank you very much. Since we've retrieved the[sr]Holy Grail, we've resolved the Singularity of this era...
[k]

？1：Have we?

？2：I don't think we have.

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...You're right.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Doctor, the Holy Grail has been secured.[sr]Have there been any changes?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Not that I can tell.[sr]The Bolt of this era is still left unsecured.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Holy Grail is indeed functioning to a certain extent.[sr]But, it's not as strong a force as before.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Maybe it's the real Holy Grail.[sr]The one that was in this era to begin with.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...In other words, it's different from the Grails we've seen?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah. The Grails that Lev Lainur supposedly placed[sr]disrupt the seven Foundations of Humanity.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But, there was another Holy Grail in these seas.[sr]Captain Drake is the one chosen by that Grail.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The reason behind the turbulent seas is that the opposing forces, the two Holy Grails, are in contention.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
"The rightful Grail held by the savior Captain Drake,"[sr]and "Lev's Holy Grail brought in from the outside to disturb the world."
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As long as Captain Drake is around, this era won't fall.[sr]However, it won't return to normal, either.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In order to restore the seas[line 3]I fear we must retrieve Lev's Holy Grail after all.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...I see. So it's not as urgent as previous eras,[sr]but the final objective is the same.
[k]

Fou...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
There's that odd voice again...[sr]Say, who are you talking to, Mash?
[k]

＠Drake
You got a pet gnome or something?
[k]

[charaFadeout C 0.1]
[charaFace A 11]
[charaFadein A 0.1 2]
＠Mash
No, it's not quite that cute.[sr]The Doctor is, how shall I say...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Think of it as a mysterious fairy,[sr]talking to us from a town really far away.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
Sure. So, he's making you guys fight,[sr]while he gets to cozy up in his home?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
In the end, what's this all about?[sr]You get what you came for?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...No. It seems there's another Holy Grail, Captain Drake,[sr]one that shouldn't exist in this era.
[k]

＠Mash
Unless we retrieve it,[sr]the ocean will be like this forever.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
Whoa, whoa, that sounds real dangerous.[sr]...Are you serious?
[k]

？1：Dead serious.

？2：Absolutely.

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Which is why I'll give this back to you.[sr]...You were meant to have it, Captain.

O-Okay.[sr]I appreciate your courtesy.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
...Boy. I've never given up a treasure so easily,[sr]or had it returned so easily either...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Doctor, can I get some advice?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
H-Hey, just hang on a second. I'm thinking.[sr]This is way beyond what I imagined...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Then, may I ask a few questions?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's a pleasure to meet you, Francis Drake. I know[sr]this may seem very sudden, but do you have a wish?
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]
[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
Wish?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
For example, you're a pirate. You wish to gather[sr]all the treasures in the world, do you not?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
Yeah, I suppose I do.[sr]So, do I just wish on this Grail to have it come true?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Most likely.[sr]Are you going to?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
Of course not.[sr]You know I'm a pirate, right?
[k]

＠Drake
A pirate that gets treasure by praying[line 2][sr]That's a bad joke if I ever heard one.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Treasure should be won through power, wisdom, and courage.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Hmm, that would mean your immediate wish[sr]is simply to secure enough water, food, and safety.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In other words, you already had that wish granted.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
...I suppose that's true.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The Holy Grail you hold has the power to create this[sr]world. However[line 2]this ocean is not what you desire.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Which means, "something" is causing this world to exist.[sr]Someone is disrupting your ocean, and your era.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
There's only one thing to be done, right?[sr]You need to reclaim your own world.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The people next to you, Mash Kyrielight and [%1], exist to resolve issues of this nature.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They're professionals who have defeated[sr]what you call "invincible guys" many times.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
I see...[sr]I think I understand now. Thanks.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
So, who does that make you?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Leonardo Da Vinci. I died about 20 years[sr]before you were born. I'm a genius.
[k]

＠Drake
Oh. Never heard of you.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
W-What...did you say?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
So, this world is broken after all.[sr]Which means that there's no treasure to begin with.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
You could be right. I don't think there is...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
No[line 4]there is![sr]I believe there is!
[k]

？1：Doctor?

？2：Aren't you a little too excited?

？！

＠Dr. Roman
In this world and era, "pirates" are a common thing.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
For better or worse, the Age of Exploration[sr]was an unavoidable event that expanded the world.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The planet's pioneers entrusted their dreams to the[sr]unknown seas and the other side of the horizon.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...And with all those "thoughts" and "desires" gathered,[sr]I wouldn't be surprised if a treasure really did exist here.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
So, it does exist?[sr]Enough gold and silver and spices to sink this ship?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yes. I, Dr. Roman, will guarantee that.[sr]There is a treasure[line 2]for sure!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
...I can't take it. I'm fired up, I'm fired up as hell![sr]All right scumbags, let's drink up a storm first!
[k]

＠Drake
Our voyage tomorrow is going to be one unlike any[sr]other! No guarantee we'll return alive, so drink your hearts out!
[k]

＠Drake
Treasures! Riches! Spices![sr]Tasty booze and uncharted adventures await us!
[k]

＠Pirate
CHEERS!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Wait, we're drinking again!?
[k]

＠Pirate
After all, we're pirates!♪[sr]Both you and I are pirates!♪
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Ah, please! No more singing!
