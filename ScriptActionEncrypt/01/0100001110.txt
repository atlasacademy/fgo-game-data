This is the Greater Grail... It's an ultra-superior Magical[sr]Reactor... What's it doing on this island nation in the Far East?

＠Dr. Roman
According to our data, it was built by an eminent family of alchemists called the Einzberns.

＠Dr. Roman
Though apparently they didn't belong to the Mage's Association, and were solely made of homunculi.

＠Dr. Roman
No question. She seems to have changed somehow but she's the king of Britain, Arthur, wielder of the Sacred Sword.

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Her gender's different than the legend, but she had her reasons for dressing like a man in Camelot.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I mean, you can't assume the throne unless you're a[sr]man, right? She must've had to pretend to be a guy for family reasons.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
I have an idea who's behind that. It's mentioned in the[sr]legends, but Merlin really does have a terrible taste.

Don't be fooled by her appearance. She's a monster.[sr]Her power is not of muscle, but a ridiculous amount of magical energy.
[k]

＠Caster
Every single strike is massive. If you're not paying[sr]attention, the top half of your body will go flying.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Basically, just think of her like a human rocket.[sr]...Understood, I'll fight back with everything I've got.

Good. If you defeat her, the anomaly in this town will[sr]disappear. Listen, that includes both me and her.

After that, it's your job.[sr]I don't know what will happen, but do the best you can.

What! You can talk?[sr]You were just maintaining your silence all this time?

Yes, and you were being watched the whole time you[sr]were chatting. I merely acted as a scarecrow.

But[line 3]it's interesting.[sr]I'm curious about that Noble Phantasm.
