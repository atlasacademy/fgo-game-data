＠Amadeus
Whew! We made it through in one piece, but we accidentally left the forest during the battle.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Amadeus
[%1] and Jeanne must be worried.[sr]Let's rest awhile, then return to camp.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...Um. It seems a bit crazy to ask questions at a time like this, but do you mind?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Amadeus
Of course not.[sr]Be it important or trivial, ask away.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Tomorrow is the final battle.[sr]You should wrap up any unfinished business.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Right.[sr]I hate to bring this back up...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
But it's about when we heard that Marie had died.[sr]This is what you said, Amadeus.
[k]

＠Mash
"Humans choose what they love."[sr]I don't understand what that meant.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Rather, I understand the meaning of the words,[sr]it's the "choose" part that I don't understand.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
I mean, things we should view favorably are morally just,[sr]and things we should reject are socially bad.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
That's what I was taught.[sr]I feel deep down that it's right.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Amadeus
Hmm.[sr]What do you consider right then?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Well... Something that saves many lives, and sees value in many lives, I suppose.
[k]

＠Amadeus
That's rather ill-defined. Let's assume for a moment that[sr][%1] were not such a person. What then?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
But that's...
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Amadeus
Forgive me, that was a mean assumption.[sr]However, keep that hesitation and discomfort in mind.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Amadeus
Mash, I suspect that you are a person who has only recently gained her freedom.
[k]

＠Amadeus
As such, you freeze in the face of hard choices and have doubts about the person you are becoming.
[k]

＠Mash
...Yes, I think you might be right.[sr]I, uh...didn't know much about the outside world.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...No. Maybe I never had the right to care for anything in the first place.
[k]

＠Mash
I mean, I[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Amadeus
Oh, dear. You truly are pure, aren't you?[sr]You're like a music sheet without a single note on it.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Amadeus
But heed my words, Mash. Even if you are a doll created for the sole purpose of fighting...
[k]

＠Amadeus
...You have the obligation to care for something.[sr]You may not have freedom, but you have obligations.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Obligations?[sr]Not rights or privileges?
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Amadeus
No, obligations.[sr]Or duties, if you like.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Humans have that responsibility, for they possess the intelligence to think.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Amadeus
What to care for, what to dislike, what is considered precious, what is considered evil.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Those are the things you must choose for your self.[sr]Not by the words of others, nor by conforming to your environment.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Amadeus
Every human is unique.[sr]So too is each one's values.
[k]

＠Amadeus
We learn and see as much as we can.[sr]By doing so, your life will be enriched.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Amadeus
Listen, the world is not what you make of it.[sr]You are what the world makes of you.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Then when you have become you, become more than this world.
[k]

＠Amadeus
You must leave proof that you existed, whatever it is.[sr]I have. All the music I left behind is proof.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Amadeus
Even though[line 3][sr]that itself is insignificant.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
???
[k]

＠Amadeus
After all, I am a man who couldn't even bear witness[sr]to the death of his one and only first love.
[k]

＠Amadeus
My legacy may have been loved by many, but my actual life was nothing special.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Amadeus
Still, I am content with that. Human beings are filthy and unpleasant. My conclusion stands.
[k]

＠Amadeus
There are sinners who shine brilliantly and saints that make one retch. So there is no need for you to fear your own future.
[k]

＠Amadeus
You are created by the world, and you expand and improve the world.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Amadeus
That is what "being a human" is all about.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Amadeus
Begin by absorbing all you can from the world and[sr]then return those favors to the world as you see fit later.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Worrying over what results that will have is a matter for another day.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Amadeus...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Amadeus
However, most things in this world have a fair value, and a result fit for such value.
[k]

＠Amadeus
As was the case with my music and my life.
[k]

＠Amadeus
As long as humans are human, evil will not prevail.[sr]After all, humanity will be unable to flourish otherwise.
[k]

＠Amadeus
It is said that "evil" is the hindrance to the prosperity[sr]of life.The species cannot survive with it there.
[k]

＠Amadeus
If humanity cannot purge itself of that "evil," that is the day of humanity's extinction. It's that simple.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Amadeus
...I see that you are now breathing more calmly.[sr]Our break is over Mash, let's return to the others.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Amadeus
Most likely this is the last time we shall chat.[sr]For some reason, it turned into a bit of a lecture.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Still, I'm happy that we were alone for this final talk.[sr]From start to finish, you're a charming young lady.
[k]

＠Amadeus
In this battle, I would have proposed to you had Maria not been there.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
...I see. Thank you great composer Amadeus,[sr]I won't forget what you said.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Amadeus
Indeed. You pass, Mademoiselle.
[k]

＠Amadeus
I want you to remember one last thing.[sr]There's nothing more beautiful than a parting smile.
