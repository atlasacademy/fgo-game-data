...All enemy movements have ceased.

＠Mash
It was powerful... But what was it, exactly?[sr]A golem? A mechanical puppet?
[k]

？1：A robot...

＠Mash
It looks...that way...[sr]I guess you could see it that way, yes...
[k]

？2：It was so cool!

＠Mash
Cool? It looked like a walking tin can to me... Well,[sr]I guess the definition of cool is subjective...

It's problematic that I can't detect any magical energy.[sr]Mash, are there any enemies remaining?

If any enemy parts are exposed, send me some images.[sr]I'll analyze them when I have the time.

Hmm...
[k]

＠Mash
It's bizarre... This mechanical armor is corroding[sr]in some places.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
It seems fine for the most part, but areas that[sr]seem to be made of metal have...corroded...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Hmm, did we use any acid attacks in the last battle?[sr]Wait, do we have any Servants of that sort?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
During the Industrial Revolution in London, massive[sr]amounts of smoke emitted from steam engines was a big social problem.
[k]

＠Mash
The sulfurous gases in the smoke got caught in the cold[sr]fog, retaining and concentrating into a fog of sulfuric acid...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
...Hmm.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Huh? Is something the matter, Mash?
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
No. Please wait...[sr]"Something like inhaling sulfuric acid?" Yes, that's it...
[k]

＠Mash
Some records from before... Should be...

＠Mash
Yes. That's right. I mean, this era[line 3]

[line 3]Jack the Ripper.

＠Mash
An infamous serial killer who not only killed many[sr]women in London at the end of the 19th century, but who also dismembered them...
[k]

＠Mash
...and directly challenged Scotland Yard. The symbol of[sr]terror that swept across England, no, all of Europe, at the time.
