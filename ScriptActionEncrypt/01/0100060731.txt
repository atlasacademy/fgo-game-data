Open your eyes, Rushd! How terrible of you, to strike a child!

Ugh... Ngh...

＠Refugee Woman
If you'll take me, take my child as well! I can't leave him on his own!
[k]

＠Enforcement Knight
That child was not chosen. Forget him. Your body no longer belongs to you.
[k]

＠Enforcement Knight
There are no exceptions. Such affection is not permitted. The ideal soul is not allowed to enjoy human freedoms.
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
I'll obey the Lion King! I'll do anything! Just let my child stay with me!
[k]

＠Refugee Woman
I'll make sure he behaves! I'll tell him to pray day and night to the Lion King as well!
[k]

＠Enforcement Knight
...No. You people won't discard your own god. Even a young child cannot.
[k]

＠Enforcement Knight
Your fervent faith is respectable. That gives your life value.

Chokhmah 2 here. Confirmed drop-out of one chosen. Vitals have ceased. Those that cannot gauge their own value have no right entering the Holy City.

Will resume the Holy Punishment after disposing of the child. End of report.

That mother earlier... She must have been chosen by mistake. Mountain scum like this mother and child will be judged[line 3]

An impressive uprising. It seems there were still fighters amongst the heretics.

However, that ends now. Causing disorder at the Holy City gate is a sin worthy of death.

I am Gawain, a Knight of the Round Table. As one entrusted with the responsibility of delivering Holy Punishment, I shall judge you.
