Still, I see... I didn't think mass production of[sr]Helter Skelters was possible before, but now the situation is dire.
[k]

＠Jekyll
It's likely due to us defeating the mage Paracelsus AKA[sr]"P," one of the three leaders of Project Demonic Fog.
[k]

＠Jekyll
The enemy recognized you as a threat, and built up their[sr]strength in order to obtain materialized Heroic Spirits.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]

We should think of it that way.[sr]But, I wonder what kind of Heroic Spirit they're seeking...

Ark? Do you mean that "Ark?"[sr]Hahaha, you are harsh indeed! What an exaggeration!

I do call myself a jack-in-the-box[sr]that releases grand, flowery words when cracked open...

That playwright is focused on getting these events down[sr]on paper, but not me. I want to do as little work as possible.

But there is something on my mind. I heard from[sr][%1] of the developments leading up to now... The seven Singularities.

＠Dr. Roman
Ah, excuse me. Can we get back on topic?[sr]A review of the current situation, and future plans?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Luckily, enemy's awareness is focusing on the Demonic[sr]Fog. If they want to wipe us out, they'd go around destroying buildings.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The fact that they haven't means the enemy is only[sr]aware of the streets that the Demonic Fog extends to.

I'm sure there's something there[sr]to take advantage of[line 3]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
Run an errand for me, basically.[sr]You guys have stamina, so isn't this the perfect job?

Working outside among all those Helter Skelters[sr]is a tall order...

[charaFadeout H 0.1]

Maybe the Mage's Association[line 3]AKA "Clock Tower?"

[charaFadeout G 0.1]
[charaTalk H]
[charaFadein H 0.1 1]
？2：Does he mean the Mage's Association?

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
Correct. Once man enters AD, mages centered around a[sr]giant academy[line 3]the Mage's Association, Clock Tower.
[k]

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Ah!
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
Right. A giant academy that is unlocking the secrets of[sr]the world exists here in London. Why would you not use it?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You're right...[sr]B-But in the state London is in now, I wonder...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If the Mage's Association[line 3]Clock Tower still stands,[sr]I'd naturally assume Jekyll is in contact with them.

[k]

＠Mordred
After materializing and meeting Jekyll,[sr]I went there to check it out immediately.
[k]

＠Mordred
The British Museum, was it? I went there[sr]because I heard that's where the entrance was.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
But the entrance was completely sealed off.[sr]It was a ruined pile of rubble.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Jekyll
Yeah. Strangely enough, "the building was demolished."[sr]No part was left untouched.
[k]

＠Jekyll
Thinking back, perhaps the mastermind of "Project Demonic Fog" crushed all possibility of resistance.
