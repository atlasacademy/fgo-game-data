Rayshift successful. ...It seems we can't[sr]see very well in our current conditions.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Fog?[sr]No, could it be smoke? It's extremely dense...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
In the sky...[sr]I can see the same "Circle of Light" as before. But...
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...with all this fog and pollution, it's obscured[line 3]

＠Dr. Roman
Fog and smoke engulfing the sky?[sr]That's fairly common for the Industrial Revolution...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...but this doesn't look like your typical fog or smoke.[sr]I'm picking up an abnormal amount of magical energy readings.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's dense. Very dense. Really dense.[sr]No, this may be a little too dense!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 2]
＠Dr. Roman
It's like the atmosphere is saturated with magical energy!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
It's poisonous to life-forms, this fog...[sr]Mash, [%1], how are you feeling?

There's nothing wrong with me.[sr]Probably because I'm a Demi-Servant.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
How about you, Senpai?[sr]You don't seem...any different than usual.
[k]

？1：Same as always.

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Good to hear.[sr]But try not to enter that dense fog if you can.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
[%1] is okay... Huh.[sr]Indeed, there are no significant vital sign changes.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
I'm a bit surprised.[sr]I have the analysis result of that fog...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
I'm positive it's harmful to organisms. It would threaten[sr]a normal human's life if they breathed it.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Mages, monsters, Servants, and Phantasmals have[sr]innate magic resistance, so for them it's a different story...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
So of course Mash is fine.[sr]But how is [%1] all right...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Hmm... I wonder.[sr]Maybe it's a poison-resistance skill?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Really?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It could be part of Mash's benefits, or rather,[sr]the benefits of the Heroic Spirit Mash fused with.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Maybe the Servant that fused with Mash has[sr]high poison resistance, or a strong blessing skill...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...and its protection extends to the Master.[sr]That could be why [%1] is safe.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
...I'm happy to be of use to Senpai,[sr]but it seems strange to call it a "skill."
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Well, [%1] is human, after all.[sr]We'll call it "Poison Resistance Skill (Temporary)," then.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
I-I see... "Temporary," is it...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
For now. London, has turned into a city of death[sr]enveloped by a magical fog.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
How does it look around there?[sr]Do you see any victims?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
No, Doctor.[sr]It's completely deserted.
[k]

＠Mash
It's currently 2:00 p.m., but there's not[sr]a single carriage or even a pedestrian in sight.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I don't see any victims.[sr]There's just nobody here.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
It's like an abandoned city...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Also, as far as we can see from the street, all the[sr]doors and windows of the buildings are shut tight.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
After people started falling victim to the fog,[sr]the survivors must have taken refuge indoors...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
I've also detected[sr]multiple life readings in the surrounding buildings.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They're likely survivors. No doubt they're[sr]in trouble being trapped indoors.
[k]

？1：We need to solve this problem at once.

？2：Let's do what we can.

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...Yes.[sr]You're right, Senpai.
[k]

＠Mash
If we obtain and destroy the Holy Grail, the existence[sr]of this abnormal London will be corrected too.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
I'm sure that applies to all the residents who lost[sr]their lives because of this fog...
[k]

＠Mash
...and those who are indoors, taking shelter from the fog.[sr]Everyone, basically.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
If Senpai and I can bring things under control here,[sr]all phenomena related to the magical fog should disappear.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
It'll be as if there were no damage or harm at all.[sr]So, um... You see, what I'm trying to say is...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Mash is trying to say:[sr]"Senpai is a nice person." Right?
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
...[sr]...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Huh? Um, should I have not said that?[sr]Wait, did I say something wrong?
[k]

(I see, I'm also wondering the same! There's too much[sr]magical energy in the area. I can't get a clear reading.)

＠Dr. Roman
(But look at that armor. She's definitely not a[sr]typical London citizen.)
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
(I thought things would be easier[sr]since we're limited to a city.)
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
(This has gotten quite troublesome![sr]We have no clue who or what she is!)

(An ordinary person who happens to have magical[sr]resistance? A mage? Or, maybe a Servant[line 3])

That was a "huddle?"

[communicationCharaFace 0]

It sounded like she knew what was going on. She[sr]probably knows more than us about the current situation in London.

Yes, Senpai.[sr]Let's go after her.
