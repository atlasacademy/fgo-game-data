＠Mash
I do have Riding Skill, but...[sr]Senpai isn't very used to horses.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Senpai, are you all right? You've been walking[sr]non-stop all this way, are you not tired?
[k]

？1：This is nothing.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Don't tell me... Before coming to Chaldea,[sr]you were the outdoors type?
[k]

？2：Are you all right Mash?

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I'm fine.[sr]As a Demi-Servant I have incredible stamina.

You shouldn't try to keep up with Mash, [%1].[sr]Demi-Servants have mind-blowing stamina.

You should've just gotten on that horse.[sr]Were you traumatized when you almost fell off?

Doctor.[sr]Try not to tease Senpai too much, please.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Hahaha![sr]Well, it's no fun just providing intel support.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[line 3]Hold! I am detecting life ahead.[sr]Not a Servant, but I think it's an enemy.

[charaFace D 1]

Faster than my scouts.[sr]If you may, please consider becoming my Court Mage.

＠Dr. Roman
Gulp. Royal service...A promotion?
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
...Doctor.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
No, no, I was just kidding.[sr]How could I ever accept royal service?
