Oh, Ana, you be careful too. I finally got a glimpse of your face.

You are a lovely young lady. I am reminded once again that my memory has its benefits. (Smile)

＠Ana
...Gatekeeper, you should be more alert. You'll be caught off guard in that state.

＠Ana
Though, now that we're headed to the Northern Wall, Demonic Beasts will never reach here.
[k]


＠Uruk Gatekeeper
Of course. As always, I eagerly await your return.

Well, you know... I can't just bring out something that doesn't belong to this era on a whim!

Come come, no time to waste! Hold on tight!

The best thing Merlin ever made was that fake arm. One rocket shot from my Bastinyan III and you'd be in the clear, but whatever...
