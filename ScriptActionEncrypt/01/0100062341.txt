Senpai, I see light at the end of the corridor.[sr]That must be sunlight!

The return trip was much quicker.[sr]I suppose we owe this to you, Mr. Holmes.

＠Holmes
Elementary, my friends. You must not rely on only your visual senses when inside a maze.
[k]

＠Holmes
You construct a three-dimensional map inside your mind as you proceed.
[k]

？1：Ah, the master detective!
？2：Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

＠Holmes
Mmm, I'm glad to be of service to you in the end.[sr]And on that note, I must bid you farewell.

＠Mash
...So, Chaldea cannot be trusted after all?
[k]

＠Holmes
Mmm, true, there is much mystery surrounding Chaldea. But there are others I must chase right now.
[k]

＠Holmes
Namely, the Phantom Spirit who... No, I must not discuss this here. If you'll excuse me, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].
[k]

＠Holmes
How about a little riddle, as a parting gift. The simplest of puzzles about the Incineration of Humanity.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
I've been thinking.[sr]Why 2018? Why now of all times?
[k]

Huh?

＠Holmes
None of you questioned it? The King of Mages erased human history itself.
[k]

＠Holmes
So, going by the Western calendar, that means the world should have ended before you were even born.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
However, he went with purging everything in 2018.[sr]He altered the history leading up to now.
[k]

＠Holmes
Think. Incineration in 2018 and burning backwards into history.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Why is that? There is only one logical conclusion.
[k]

＠Holmes
The King of Mages had a reason why he needed to wait until 2018. Let's suppose he exists in 1000 BC.
[k]

＠Holmes
Between 1000 BC and 2018 AD there are approximately 3,000 years. He needed to burn all of it.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
Do you follow? The King of Mages did not destroy it because he wanted to.
[k]

＠Holmes
He burned it because he needed to. The result may be the same, but we cannot overlook this tiny detail.
[k]

？1：Not because... he hates humans?
？2：Now that you mention it...

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Exactly. How can one bear murderous intent if they do not care at all?
[k]

＠Holmes
...However, this is where the inquiry becomes a little tricky. Needless to say, the reason is a complete mystery.
[k]

＠Holmes
One theory is what I've mentioned earlier: that the time frame from the past up until 2018 has meaning.
[k]

＠Holmes
The other... is that even King Solomon could not see past the year 2018.
[k]

＠Holmes
King Solomon had the ability to see into the future.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
And if for some reason even he could not see past 2018, then...
[k]


？1：...No future existed in the first place?

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
The same conclusion at which I have arrived.[sr]I can only pray that this is not the case.
[k]

？2：Because the King of Mages is going to destroy the world?

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Yes. That is the easiest answer.[sr]I pray it turns out to be true.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Holmes
Now then, I must part ways here![sr]The next time we meet, yes...
[k]

＠Holmes
I hope it'll be in a bustling metropolitan city like London, not in these wastelands!
