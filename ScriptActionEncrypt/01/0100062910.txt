＠Holy City Soldier
Lord Agravain, the front gate's been destroyed! We must tell the Lion King!
[k]

＠Holy City Soldier
It's only a matter of time before they make it to the castle town... Tell the king to use his Light of Judgment!

＠Agravain
There's no need. Even if the front gate has fallen, we still have the Knights of the Round Table.
[k]

＠Agravain
Tristan is stationed in the castle town. Mordred's forces are outside.
[k]

＠Agravain
Their momentum is temporary. That sandstorm will soon disappear. Continue the fight until it does.

Yes, well...um... Sir Mordred's raiders were defeated by another similar unit.

Sir Lancelot has betrayed us. The Knight of the Lake no longer stands with the Holy City!

＠Dr. Roman
There's no time to feel sentimental! A massive number of magical energy responses is approaching!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Until now it's been a mix of soldiers and Enforcement Knights, but these guys aren't even human anymore...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They're a type of divine construct created by the sacred lance's magical energy, and more powerful than anything we've faced before!
[k]

...Nobody's here. There's no sign that they're hiding in the buildings.
[k]

＠Mash
The people of the Holy City are gone. Only the soldiers are here.

＠Mash
Maybe... the Holy Selection is over and the people have been absorbed by the sacred lance?

I'm not sure about that. If that was the case, the vicinity around the Holy City would be at the edge of the world already.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
There's a good chance they've been evacuated since the battle started. To the Lion King, the citizens are irreplaceable people...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Or irreplaceable parts, right.

I'm sorry, that was wrong of me to say! Anyway, for now, let's fight!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They're coming! These are the Enforcement Knights directly assigned to the Holy City! There's no need to hold back!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They're clones of the Lion King. Consider this a warm-up!
