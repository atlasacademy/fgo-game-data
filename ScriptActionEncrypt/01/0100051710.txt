＠Medb
Hey! Guess what, my king?[sr]They're dead. Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid.
[k]

＠Medb
Looks like the Servants turned the tables on them.[sr]You really can't underestimate them, can you?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Medb
Or, could it be that their Master is even stronger than we thought?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...That's nice.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Medb
So apathetic. Not interested?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Of course not. The greatest benefit of a dead man is that you no longer have to think of him.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
What interests me is what the living are up to.[sr]...Let's see. What do you think they're planning to do?

Ah. Speak.

[charaTalk F]
＠Soldier
Yes sir. The United Western States Army split their troops to the north and south. The South Army is advancing towards us.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Medb
My, they want a final battle?
[k]

[charaTalk F]
＠Soldier
They're bringing in troops standing by at the rear as well. No doubt about it.
[k]

＠Soldier
And leading the army is[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Medb
It's not Edison?
[k]

[charaTalk F]
＠Soldier
No, Edison and Blavatsky are in charge of the North Army. The South Army is led by another Servant.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Medb
...There's more?

Yes. Leading the South Army is a young male Servant,[sr]and a Servant with a giant shield.
[k]

＠Soldier
We have also confirmed a nurse Servant.
[k]

＠Soldier
Leading the vanguard is Karna[line 2]the thin Lancer with a shining spear.

[k]

[charaTalk F]
＠Soldier
Karna's presence had been previously confirmed, but...
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Medb
That still leaves three new Servants!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...Probably more than three.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Medb
Huh?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
My mentor, the Indian rascal, even the Servant I let escape once...
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
On top of it, that shield Servant from the report...[sr]That means there must be more.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Medb
What, no way![sr]Edison partnered up with those guys!?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Medb
...In other words, they gave up on giving up?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Looks like it.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
He gave up on protecting America,[sr]and instead decided to take the world for his own.
[k]

＠Medb
Hmm, this might not be good, huh?[sr]You never know what can happen in an all-out war.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Medb
What to do?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...Hey.
[k]

＠Soldier
Yes?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
We're off to war. Gather troops.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Medb
W-Wait... Are you planning on joining the fight!?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Of course. Are you planning on leaving them alone?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Medb
No, no! In the name of the Mad King, I won't let them be. I'll crush those Servants with my entire army.
[k]

＠Medb
By advancing on us, they insulted the king and provoked us. Then again, it just goes to show how desperate they are.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Medb
Desperate people are favorable for me.
[k]

＠Medb
The despair of those who hate us and spite us is so many shades darker than the ordinary kind, you see?
[k]

＠Medb
An avenging father slain by his family's murderer, a lover killed by someone whose lover was also killed,
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Medb
I love stories like that. That's why I simply squash them, with my superior resources!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Medb
Let us divide our army into two forces as well.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Medb
Leave the North Army to Beowulf, and put Arjuna in charge of the South Army.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Medb
I'll take care of informing the Servants.[sr]Now, go!

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...Taking the scout's report into consideration, their main force is the South Army.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
They're planning to crush our forces with that army and march straight to the capital.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Medb
The North Army only needs to hold the front.[sr]At worst, they're buying time?
[k]

＠Medb
My oh my...[sr]And they call themselves proud Servants?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
That's just how desperate they are.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
That Edison guy has cast aside his pride,[sr]and is trying to protect this world and fix history.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
The source is most likely[line 2]the world's last remaining Master that was in the reports.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...Medb.[sr]How are you reading this?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Servants unleash their greatest powers when they have a Master.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
If they come fighting not as individual troops,[sr]but as Servants accompanying their Master[line2]
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Is our army powerful enough to defeat them?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Medb
...Let's see.[sr]It might be tough.
[k]

＠Medb
Beowulf and Arjuna are both top-notch warriors, but they have no will to fight.
[k]

＠Medb
You could say Arjuna has a reason to fight, although it's a very personal one.
[k]

＠Medb
But Beowulf is only barely following orders.[sr]I can't imagine him losing... but...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Medb.[sr]We're going all in.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Medb
!!![sr]O-Okay.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Medb
But I need time. Setting the North aside, the South[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
I'll hold the South down.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Arjuna can lead the charge,[sr]and I'll destroy all the Servants I can get my hands on.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
After all, they've got that woman.
[k]

＠Medb
...Scáthach?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Yeah, she IS my mentor.[sr]I can't imagine any other man being able to handle her.
[k]

＠Medb
[line 2]Do you want to fight her?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
No.[sr]I am a king. A king doesn't fight for self-interest.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
I am the frame in establishing this nation. I'll devote myself to being a weapon slaughtering opponents.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
As long as Karna lives, Arjuna won't have the composure to deal with other Servants.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
If that is the case, I'll go.[sr]I'll go, and I'll kill.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Medb
Very well.[sr]I won't stop you. Ride forth, my king!

Despite having no intention of unifying the nation,[sr]you devote yourself to its creation.

[charaFace E 1]
＠Medb
That's why you never lose. You always kill the opposition. Once all opposition is gone, you may even turn on your allies.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Medb
...Perhaps that's the very thing I've been desiring most.
[k]

＠Medb
For a king such as you to throw everything in this world into chaos.

＠Medb
To wipe out everyone equally, with your Gáe Bolg.

Oh believers of justice and miracles... Hurry up and come here! Let me lead you to your unsightly death!
