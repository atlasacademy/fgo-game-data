The winds are picking up... Heh heh heh. Sandstorms are child's play for us. A good omen indeed.

We'd get lost in all this if it weren't for you. What a relief you're here with us.

＠Mash
It looks like we'll quickly reach the fort without encountering any Holy City forces.

Oh, no, sorry! Scratch that! Rather, it's an “interesting” one.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
How should I describe it... Shiny and fluffy, yet also stocky!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's a colorful Servant, impossible for the Knights of the Round Table!

No, no. It seems that this time reason outweighed instinct... The reason being that someone requires assistance.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
[%1] is among the best at sensing danger. If it were a hopeless battle, there'd be more hesitation.

[charaFace G 2]
＠Hundred Personas
But still, only hesitation!? What a fool indeed!
