＠Mordred
All right, we're here.[sr]This big building is Victor's mansion.
[k]

＠Mordred
Unlike Jekyll who's half-assed,[sr]he is a genuine mage, so be careful.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
Traps like barriers and such are set up all over, so even[sr]Servants get hurt if they touch things without knowing.
[k]

＠Mordred
When I first visited to check things out,[sr]I had an absolutely terrible experience here.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Oh, okay.[sr]I'll be careful, then.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A death trap workshop in an urban area...[sr]Sounds like a cautious old guy with pretty strong nerves.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
The first challenge is the entrance door.[sr]See, look at that big door[line 3]

Someone is at the entrance...[sr]A tall silhouette... A clown?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
Hey, you! Scarecrow! Or are you a living statue?[sr]Whatever! Anyway...
[k]

＠Mordred
...you stink like hell.[sr]It's like blood, guts, and fire.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
And the catalyst for the old man's favorite[sr]elemental spell? I can smell it from here!
[k]

＠Mordred
You killed him, didn't you.[sr]You murdered Victor Frankenstein.

＠???
Indeed, indeed. That elderly man will not open his[sr]mouth, brush his teeth, eat food, or breathe ever again.
[k]

＠???
Yes, yes.[sr]Frankly speaking, I'm certain he is dead.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠???
It's a shame. He refused to join our cause.[sr]Right till the very end.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠???
But, and yet, however.[sr]Who killed Victor Frankenstein?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠???
That might be quite a difficult question to answer.[sr]Because he "blew himself up."

[charaFace G 1]

That was a joke, and I'm sorry for letting you down,[sr]but I'm actually a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠???
I'm a Servant just like you.[sr]The class is Caster.

No, I'm sure you got that.[sr]You wonder why I revealed my class so easily?

＠???
It is reasonable during a Holy Grail War unlike[sr]any other. At least that lady over there knows why!
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠???
An encounter instantly becomes an all-out battle![sr]As we are Servants without Masters[line 3]
[k]

＠???
We can be called the most powerful forces on the earth.[sr]However...
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

Sadly, it seems that you have a Master.[sr]Best you protect yourself well. Otherwise, in no time...

But still, it feels good to do your best.[sr]You will work hard for a job you enjoy.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠???
His expression in the moment he died. The face of a[sr]human who understood the transition from life to death!
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠???
Despair![sr]Sorrow! Ah! That is exactly it[line 3]!
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

Well, anyway, something like that[line 3]

It killed my boredom?[sr]At least, I guess?

You seem to be a hot-blooded person![sr]Good, that's fine. I'll try not to disappoint you then!
[k]

＠???
You might as well watch out for the explosions![sr]My Noble Phantasm has already been set up!
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠???
By my True Name, Mephistopheles![sr]I shall relish striking you all down into despair!
[k]

You've set up what!? Dammit! I don't know if[sr]it's because of the fog or his skill, but it's undetectable!
