...So this is the Cedar Forest? Legends say it was protected by the Demonic Beast Humbaba...
[k]

Though I thought it was believed to be located east of Uruk, in the Zagros Mountains beyond the Tigris...

Oh, there are two versions of the story.[sr]The Sumerian and Akkadian versions differ.

The older records put the Cedar Forest to the west.

＠Dr. Roman
So it makes sense that we would find it here, but...
[k]

？1：...It's a strangely dark forest.

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...Yeah. I agree. The Cedar Forest in the Epic of Gilgamesh was a holy place.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It was bright enough that they called it the “Forest of White Cedars.” But this place... It's like being in the belly of the beast.

Oh, are you worried about the direction we are going? There is a wharf at the river up ahead.

There is a boat docked there. Once we get to the wharf, all we have to do is take it downstream.

We're stranded. As you can see, we didn't know our way through these trails and got lost.

I figured we were going to end up monster food, but luck must be on our side!

We weren't lucky enough to reach our destination this time, but we met locals who know the way.

King Gilgamesh is commanding the front line in Uruk. He's just returned from his quest for the herb of immortality.

Whaaa[line 3] Hold up![charaFace A 6] That doesn't make any sense!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If we're in the era where Gilgamesh has already returned from his search for immortality, something's very wrong!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He didn't set out on that quest until AFTER the death of his friend... Enkidu.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And that means, if he's already returned... Enkidu should be long dead!
[k]

He might exist as a Servant, but he can't be alive!
