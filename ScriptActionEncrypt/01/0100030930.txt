＠Hektor
Now, according to my calculations, it's almost time.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Euryale
...Why me? Does your Master have the same[sr]tastes as Blackbeard?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Hektor
Oh no, my boss may be a worthless womanizer,[sr]but he's not brave enough to hit on a goddess like you.
[k]

＠Hektor
Let's just say your very existence is important.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Hektor
Even if you've fallen to the level of a Servant,[sr]Divine Spirits normally don't appear in this world.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Hektor
...So, now that you've appeared,[sr]it'd be a waste not to use you, right?
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Euryale
As a Divine Spirit, I'm low-tier, you know?
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Hektor
They're probably not expecting any combat skills[sr]from a goddess like you.
[k]

＠Hektor
"Offer a god as a sacrifice."[sr]This is the only thing we expect from you.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Euryale
Oh? Offer to whom?
[k]

＠Hektor
To the world. We can't tolerate being part of an[sr]endless spiral.
[k]

＠Hektor
Even if we take a little risk,[sr]we have to blow this world to pieces.
[k]

＠Euryale
...Who do you serve, exactly?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Hektor
Mm... That's a good question.[sr]Who do you think this old man is serving!?
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Euryale
...In any case, asserting principles of anarchy[sr]is sure to meet interference in the end.
[k]

＠Euryale
Honestly, whether or not they'll come[sr]is like fifty-fifty.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Euryale
...Hmph, it must have been because Asterios was there.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Hektor
What?[sr]That is "the Golden Hind!"
