The king wandered without ever recovering her sword, and became a Heroic Spirit of heaven.
[k]

＠Merlin
Thus, “The Altria who kept using the sacred lance” will never come here to Avalon.
[k]

＠Merlin
Unlike you, who came here to return the sacred sword.
[k]

＠Merlin
There's just one way to release her. This time, give her back the sacred sword.
[k]

＠Merlin
But...you understand, right?
[k]

＠Merlin
The reason you've been able to continue your journey this far is because of that sword.
[k]

＠Merlin
Giving it back means that everything will end.
[k]

＠Merlin
Your long journey, all that you've suffered, will end without ever being repaid.
[k]

＠Merlin
For a human who depends on their physical body, the longer they live, the greater the fear of death.
[k]

＠Merlin
It's been 1,500 years. The weight of the fear you feel towards death is unimaginable even for me.
[k]

＠Merlin
The pain of eternal life is tough, but that's all it is. Anyone can endure it if they try.
[k]

＠Merlin
But the weight of what you're about to do is a fear that none can bear to look upon.
[k]

＠Merlin
Even so... Will you go?
[k]

＠Merlin
Will you right that mistake from days gone by? All you wanted was for the king to live...
[k]

＠Merlin
Sir Bedivere. Will you do this when you yourself have done nothing wrong?

The King of Mages, Solomon. The temple where he resides in is outside the proper flow of time.

Perhaps they were mages, let loose upon the world as the King of Mages' descendants until the hour of their awakening.

＠Lion King
They lived on from the era of the King of Mages, and stayed a part of human history until the year 2018.

But the seventh Grail alone was sent to the past by the King of Mages himself.

And sorry. We can't give you much to thank you for what you did.

As always, what happened in the Singularity was undone when we fixed the problem.

It won't remain in people's memories, or human history.

You won't even get the glory after all you did. It's tough. I realized now by going myself.

Once again, good work, [%1]. Now there's only one Grail left.

[charaFace A 7]

Where is it, Doctor?

The Lion King said that it was before the time of King Solomon. In other words, it's located before 1011 BC...

...We've observed a Singularity in 2600 BC. In the ancient world of Mesopotamia.
[k]


？1：At last, we're visiting ancient Uruk!
？2：Then let's go now!

？！


＠Dr. Roman
Yeah, I'd love to do that. But Rayshifts into the BC era have a very low success rate.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even with the entire control room staff working on it, it's going take a long time to prove we can do a Rayshift that far into the past.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Hurry too much, and we'll screw it up. For now, I want you to wait on standby.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Just consider it badly needed rest. This time it was particularly tough, after all.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Both you, [%1], and of course Mash, need a break, right?
[k]


？1：That's true...
？2：...(Roman's being insistent...)

？！


[charaFace F 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Yup. Yup. So get back to your room and wash off the dirt from your travels!
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...But stay sharp.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The year 2600 BC is right in the middle of what we call the Age of Gods.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Whatever's waiting at the Seventh Singularity will be far worse than what came before.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's a world where gods, devils, and the world of the dead were a part of everyday life.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And[line 3]there's something there that even King Solomon couldn't see.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A terrible monster awaits at the Seventh Singularity. A great power that would deny humanity the right to exist.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Defeating it is your job, and ours. It's Chaldea's final mission...
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Please, get some rest until then.
[k]


？1：It's just one thing after another, huh?
？2：Do you ever have good news?

？！

[charaFace F 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Oh, I do have one bit of good news. A new name just showed up on the list of summonable Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He never had any accomplishments to become a Heroic Spirit, but after what happened, maybe Humanity recognized him.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Or maybe it was something set up by the Lion King. Either way, you'll see him soon.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Don't get too surprised, okay? His name is[line 3]

Yes! Of course I am! There's another Senpai I can trust now!

He probably doesn't remember what happened at the Holy City... No, he probably never experienced it.

But still, I'm happy. I'm happy it's been proven he was right.

I'm happy it's been proven that his journey wasn't meaningless.

You mean my journey with you? Are you asking if it's going to hurt if I keep going...?
