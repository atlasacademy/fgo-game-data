＠Drake
We'll be entering unknown territory soon.[sr]We won't be able to use the Vikings' map anymore.
[k]

＠Drake
It'll be an adventure, so that's fine![sr]The problem is Blackbeard's ship.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Even with just four Servants,[sr]it's still a formidable amount of enemies.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
If we make a bad approach,[sr]their guns and cannons will destroy our ship.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
We're way faster though.[sr]Should we use the ram to charge in?
[k]

＠Mash
These seas don't seem to have many obstacles...[sr]We'll probably encounter them from afar like last time.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
If we were to have any chance, it would have to be during a Wild Hunt...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
They don't notice us, we notice them, and then[sr]a storm hits at the perfect time[line 2]

That's wishing for too much, really.

＠Euryale
...How about we shoot arrows before they notice us,[sr]to confuse them?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
They'll certainly be confused,[sr]but there are still Servants on their side.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...That woman with the musket is especially problematic.[sr]If it turns into a gunfight, I don't think the confusion tactic will work.

Why doesn't someone board their ship[sr]and cause a riot before the ships collide?

Are you stupid? How would someone[sr]board their ship before our ship... Oh.

Heheh. I am a goddess.[sr]But... I was technically summoned as Orion.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Artemis
So I have control over Orion's power.

Ah, now I remember.[sr]Orion can walk on water.
