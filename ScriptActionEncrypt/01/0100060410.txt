[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
It's like a floating city on a sea of sand! What a feat of engineering... You can tell just by looking at it!
[k]

＠Mash
So that's the palace of the Sun King Ozymandias[line 3][sr]The legendary shining temple complex, Ramesseum Tentyris!
[k]

？1：Yup, yup... Who's that?
？2：Hm, hm... What's that?

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
Oh, right. Roman always gives a lecture at times like this.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Da Vinci
The Sun King Ozymandias. Or originally, Ramesses II. The greatest, most powerful pharaoh of ancient Egypt.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes, a true pharaoh among pharaohs who called himself the God King. He brought great prosperity to Egypt around 1300 BC.
[k]

＠Mash
It's not unusual for pharaohs to see themselves as gods, but even then, the Sun King was always the one closest to the sun.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
He was also known as a great architect.
[k]

＠Mash
So great that it's even said he proclaimed,[sr]“All temples on this earth were built by me.”
[k]

＠Mash
If that's true, he may be linked to the story of humanity's oldest dynamo, the Dendera light system.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
He is also called the Construction King as well. That great temple is likely one of his Noble Phantasms.
[k]

？1：That's amazing.
？2：So Nitocris didn't make the furniture...

＠Da Vinci
However, Mash, there's something I want to confirm first. Any transmissions from Roman?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Oh... I'm sorry, I got carried away. Our connection to the Doctor hasn't been restored yet.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
As expected. This proves my hypothesis.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[%1], Mash. The Rayshift brought us to the 13th-century Middle East.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That's for certain. However,[charaFace D 4] this isn't entirely 13th-century Earth. My staff can measure magical energy, and...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The quality of magical energy has changed since we came here. The magical energy here is much older.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Nitocris said that this is the territory of Egypt.[sr]She wasn't just speaking of our location.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
This desert is from the BC era.[sr]I have no idea why, but[line 3]
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In this Sixth Singularity, the world ruled by Ozymandias has been transported over entirely.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Space-time itself is in disarray.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
That's the reason why we couldn't Rayshift to Jerusalem, and why we can't contact Chaldea now.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
No way... Then the Sixth Singularity isn't the Holy Land, but this desert?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
Hmm... Can't say for sure yet. What I do know is that this Egyptian territory is like a foreign body in this world.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
In addition, according to my measurements, there is another location in this territory where space-time is distorted.
[k]

？1：Even more distorted than the desert?
？2：Like a foreign body inside a foreign body?

？！

[charaFace D 2]
＠Da Vinci
Yes, that's a good way to put it. This is just a hunch, but it might be the key to our search.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I'm curious as to exactly what it is... But in any event, we should solve the mystery right in front of us first.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Let's head to the great temple of Ozymandias![sr]If legends are true, he should be a fussy, handsome boy!
