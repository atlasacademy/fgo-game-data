？1：Wh-what is this? Is he ripping off the Doctor?

[communicationCharaFace 2]
＠Gilgamesh
I'm not ripping anyone off. I was inspired! Why do you think I went to the observation post last time?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I made a communication system for this very moment!
[k]

？2：I can see through you!

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Gilgamesh
Hmm. So it's not quite perfect, huh?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I thought it would be boring to copy Chaldea, so I attempted to make a more refined communications system. And it seems I didn't quite succeed. It's infuriating!
[k]

But it is very good for something done in a rush, right? You have my permission to praise my prowess as a mage!

Those Laḫmu attacked again! But this time, amazingly, we're kinda holding them off!

His Majesty rolled out those big bows on the castle walls! Three hundred and sixty of them!

But! The soldiers won't last any longer than that! Nor will my magical energy!

That's all I have to report! Now, what about you fools?

＠Quetzalcoatl
Hey! Calm down, Gilgamesh! Listen, Kingu's heart was the Grail!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Tiamat was using the Grail as a power source to control what was left of Enkidu!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Then a Laḫmu took the Grail, and threw it into the center of the Persian Gulf, which is where we are now!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
It's all my fault! Quetzalcoatl did it! Does that settle it? I think that settles it, right? Great! Then we're done talking about it forever!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
So do you have a plan!? I'm open to ideas right now! Even yours!

＠Gilgamesh
I see. That was...succinct, Quetzalcoatl. Now let me tell you what I think!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
First! We got the results from the water analysis.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
The black seawater is Tiamat's Authority itself!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Gilgamesh
It infects those who touch it, and Tiamat's Authority is copied into their cells and makes them into her slaves.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
The Laḫmu were born from the mud of Tiamat. They probably aren't affected by it.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
But anyone else, Servant or human, that touches that black mud will be absorbed by Tiamat!
[k]

That's right... Mother... I mean Tiamat's Authority includes self-modification, multiplication, and bio-fusion.
[k]

＠Ishtar
But her most powerful one is the “Amino Geas,” or cell compulsion.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Once they're inside that mud, it will Darken any Servant.

Yes, I'm sorry I'm late. But I got Eridu back on its feet.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The people are evacuated to the basement of Eridu's ziggurat, instead of heading to Uruk.
[k]

＠Ishtar
They can hole up in there for a day. Even Laḫmu can't break in there easily.

＠Gilgamesh
A Darkening mud, you say? I've never seen it, but what an annoying concept to deal with.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 2]
＠Gilgamesh
Whatever. Second! The observation post not only recorded the water quality, but also the height of the water and waves!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
They observed an unusual water level. The moment the Grail was stolen from you, the water started to rise by the minute!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
By my calculations, the observation post will be swallowed in three hours, and the black sea will overflow onto land.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
What we're going to see is something even worse than the great flood that once destroyed Mesopotamia.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
It'll be a black sea of mud that turns all life it touches into monsters!

Oh, fine! I'll tell you! I just observed a Spirit Origin signature at the center of the Persian Gulf!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's a Holy Grail, with an ultra-ultra-ultra-class Magical Reactor Core with more than seven times the magical energy of a Grail...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's no doubt that this is the primordial Demonic Beast who birthed the world of Mesopotamia! The Spirit Origin belongs to Tiamat!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If this calamity, this sea, is Tiamat's Authority, our only solution is to defeat Tiamat herself!

She's on a completely different level than the Demon Gods you've fought before. Are you willing to do it anyway, [%1]?

Impossible. How can Servants win without a Master?

The further a Servant is from their Master, the less efficient the magical energy transfer. And you'll need the Command Spells, too.

I call it a water strider. If it's just you, it should keep the water away so you won't fall in.
