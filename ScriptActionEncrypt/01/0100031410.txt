That's unnecessary.[sr]It seems Heracles has been defeated.

What?[sr]Hey Medea, that's not funny.

Oh, there he is.[sr]Hey Jason! Can you hear me?

[charaFace G 2]
＠Drake
Well then, we're coming for you!
[k]

＠Jason
...Impossible![sr]Heracles! What happened to Heracles!?
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Drake
Oh, come on. You really need to ask?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Drake
If he was alive,[sr]we obviously wouldn't be, right?
[k]

＠Drake
Since we're alive, it means he's dead.[sr]That's pretty simple logic.
[k]

＠Jason
There's no way he'd die![sr]He's Heracles! The great immortal hero!
[k]

＠Jason
He's the epitome of a hero, someone who heroes admired, challenged, yet still fell short of!
[k]

＠Jason
There's no way a petty, ragtag bunch like you[sr]could ever overcome someone like that!
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Drake
...I guess even you felt a semblance of friendship.[sr]Even if it was a distorted one.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Drake
Well, fine. If that's what you want to believe, so be it.[sr]We'll settle the match.

We're retreating! Using this Holy Grail,[sr]all I need to do is summon a new Servant!

As far as I can tell, we're still at an advantage here.[sr]...Well, gotta follow the captain's orders.

So you ARE thinking of running.[sr]Just as I thought. Men, are you all ready?

"Golden Hind!"[sr]This is our last voyage, our final task as pirates!
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Drake
The target is the Argo! The treasure they[sr]hold captive is the freedom of the seas!
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Drake
We'll have them pay us back in full![sr]Ring the bells, brothers!

＠Pirate
Aye, aye, Boss!

[charaFace G 2]
＠Drake
Hard to port![sr]Make a steady approach and fire the cannons and guns!

Damn, how are they catching up![sr]This is the legendary ship, Argo!

The difference is in the helmsman, I guess.[sr]Those are the skills of one who has lived with the sea.

They're fundamentally different from someone[sr]who just takes his boat out casually.

Damn... We have no choice.[sr]O Holy Grail!
