We haven't reached our goal of ten thousand and we're nowhere near an ideal twenty thousand, but...

we should be able to make that up with Lancelot and Ozymandias' forces, thanks to you.

But, day by day, little by little, the heads of the villagers who'd visit our village came forth.

We'll head into the wastelands, assemble the forces scattered there, and head toward the Holy City.

[charaFadeout C 0.1]

[charaTalk F]
[charaFace F 0]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]

I will lead the way. The terrain in the wastelands has blind spots that will not be noticed by patrols.
[k]

But that is only until we get to the city itself. There are no hiding places in the wastelands surrounding the Holy City.
[k]

[charaFadeout F 0.1]

[charaTalk C]
[charaFace C 0]
[charaFadein C 0.1 1]

＠Cursed Arm
Aye. Therefore, we will take our final rest further out, then aim for the Holy City under the cover of night.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
I hope we reach the city while it's still dark, but we have an army of nearly ten thousand, and few horses.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
It will likely be dawn by the time we're close enough to see the city. And they will then be able to see us.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
The Lion King's forces will notice our advance, and strengthen their defenses. We will break through this, and force our way into the Holy City grounds.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
With our allied forces, we will gain control over the Holy City, and take down the king's castle. After that, I want you to take over, [%1].
