Okay, you came all the way to the top! Hurry, [%1]! There on the altar... That's the Sun Stone...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Aztec Calendar...a monolith that's said to show the past, present, and future according to the Aztecs!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's definitely Quetzalcoatl's second Noble Phantasm! If we destroy it, this temple will just be a decoration,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
and we can remove Quetzalcoatl's trump card from the game! Two birds with one stone!

Hurry, [%1]![sr]This is our only chance to defeat the evil goddess!

＠Dr. Roman
What's wrong, Master [%1]!? Why are you stopping...!?

Anyway, [%1], what are you going to do? You wasted your one and only chance, so what's your plan?
[k]

＠Ishtar
Jaguar Warrior and I can only block Quetzalcoatl's charge one time.
[k]

＠Ishtar
You can smash the Sun Stone then.
[k]

？1：...Jaguar Warrior is right.
？2：...This is humanity's battle.

This is one hell of a time for boasting.[sr]...But, yes, I agree, crazy as it is.

＠Ishtar
But how exactly are you going to fight?[sr]Hit her with that club?

？2：It's obvious. I'll use courage!

All Quetzalcoatl has to do is step to the side at the bottom of the steps and you're dead!

Think about slamming your own belly button into her collar bone. That sounds like it'll work. Yep.

You, [%1], are an amateur, so your big sis was really worried...
