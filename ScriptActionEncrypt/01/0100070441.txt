＠Leonidas
As you can see! In a spar against one hundred men, you reach your limit around sixty! But that's when the real fight begins!
[k]

＠Leonidas
Muscles that are about to give out! Hearts about to burst, your energy reserves down to zero...
[k]

＠Leonidas
I want you all to learn how to fight in such extreme conditions! Just like how Lady Mash did when she fought you all!

＠Leonidas
Very good. Well, that's enough muscle philosophy.[sr]We'll be talking about brains next.
[k]

＠Leonidas
It's common sense that you would be strong when you're energized. After all, a body in peak condition can do anything.
[k]

＠Leonidas
But once the battle starts, you start to drop from your “best condition” with each passing second.
[k]

＠Leonidas
So instead of trying to maintain your best condition, I want you to learn how to balance it with your “worst condition.”
[k]

＠Leonidas
The tenacity you get when you're in that state of fatigue reigns supreme. What can you do when you can't do anything?
[k]

＠Leonidas
Understanding that alone boosts your survival rate.[sr]The limits of your stamina are much like waves breaking upon the shore...
[k]

＠Leonidas
You'll be able to fight again if you can get over the peak of your fatigue! Do not forget: fatigue is not a bad thing!

＠Leonidas
Illness comes from the spirit. I say that you see ghosts when you are weak-spirited. But being wounded is bad. It's BAD.
[k]

＠Leonidas
If you're wounded, you need to switch out with someone else immediately. Fighting spirit doesn't heal wounds!
[k]

＠Leonidas
Fatigue and injury are separate issues. Understand?[sr]Now for lesson two!!!
[k]

＠Leonidas
Toss away your spear, but not your shield!
[k]

＠Leonidas
Any spear will do, but a shield is special![sr]You'll never find another one like yours!
[k]

＠Leonidas
You must find the best shield for yourself![sr]There is no shield superior to the round shield!

＠Dr. Roman
Oh, that's right. Ana's a Rogue Servant; she doesn't have a Master.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Servants that have contracted with a Master can draw most of their magical energy from him or her.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It is the Master who determines a Servant's possible energy output and how long they can fight.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Of course, a Servant can fight with the magical energy they generate themselves, but that would make them no different from a Shadow Servant.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A Servant will only truly shine after they've contracted with a Master. They can be even more powerful if the bond is a strong and intimate one.

I see... I was in the Cedar Forest this whole time, so I didn't know...
[k]

？1：You don't know anything about being a Servant?

？！

＠Ana
...No. When I came to I was in the forest, and in this body. I had no knowledge about being a Servant.
[k]

＠Ana
...But I knew just what I had to do.[sr]I had to kill those Demonic Beasts.
[k]

＠Ana
I was killing them all alone, and using their souls to maintain my Spirit Origin...
[k]

？1：Do you want to contract with me?

I'm here because of your hostilities with the Three Goddess Alliance.
[k]

＠Ana
...You will, without doubt, fight them at the Northern Wall. Merlin said so.

＠Ana
...I'm just waiting for that moment.

＠Ana
Whatever happens to humanity is none of my concern...
