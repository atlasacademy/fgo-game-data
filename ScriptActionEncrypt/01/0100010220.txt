You guys, I can't believe you took them on.

...We're used to it. Anyway I'm sorry, but could you please explain this from the start?

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Is it true that Jeanne d'Arc has been resurrected?
[k]

＠Soldier
Yes. I took part in the siege of Orleans and the ceremony, so I remember it well.
[k]

＠Soldier
Her hair and skin color are different, but there's[sr]no question that she's the saint from the past.
[k]

＠Soldier
Hearing that she'd been captured by the English[sr]and burned at the stake, we trembled in fury.
[k]

＠Soldier
But[line 2]she was resurrected.[sr]And through a pact with the devil, no less!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
What do you mean the devil?[sr]Like the skeleton soldiers earlier?
[k]

＠Soldier
Not those.[sr]At least those we can handle ourselves.

？1：Dragons!?

？2：Wyverns!?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes.[sr]That is a subspecies of dragons called wyverns.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
That is definitely a creature that should not be in 15th Century France!
