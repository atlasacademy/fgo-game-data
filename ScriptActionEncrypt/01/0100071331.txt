Don't tempt me; I'd seriously consider it. A king should be versed in architecture if he hopes to be a truly well-rounded ruler.

By the way, it's an interlocking wooden frame, and the pressure comes from oil. It all rises up as if a wave is pushing it into the air.

Ishtar headed to the underworld for no reason, and was stripped of her divinity by the seven underworld gates.

I see... Ishtar, the goddess of bountiful harvest, can be seen as the Great Earth Mother symbolizing human life.

＠Dr. Roman
On the other hand, Ereshkigal symbolizes human death, and is the Terrible Earth Mother.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The two goddesses are two sides of the same coin, and perhaps born from the same deity.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The goddess nurturing life later becomes a goddess of death. Izanami of Japanese myths follows this pattern as well.

＠Dr. Roman
So...if Ishtar was summoned, then by extension Ereshkigal would be too.

The possibility does exist. Ereshkigal cannot leave Kur.
[k]

＠Merlin
When she moved around above ground, she probably used your body. Secretly, like when you were asleep.
[k]

？1：...I see...
？2：...Hmm.

？！

It is Ereshkigal's scent of death that fills Uruk now.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Ereshkigal's gallû spirits remove souls from the weak and exhausted first.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
One such spirit must have taken King Gilgamesh's soul to Kur.

If that's the case, we still have time! We haven't yet buried the king's corpse.

＠Siduri
If we liberate his soul from the soul cages, he might wake up!

＠Merlin
That is correct, Lady Siduri. Actually, we'd be in a lot of trouble if we lost him now.

＠Merlin
King Gilgamesh's leadership is an absolute necessity if we want to defeat Gorgon.

Huh. Wait, you both speak of going to Kur so easily. Isn't that a bit...overzealous?
[k]

＠Ishtar
It's the underworld. A world where every Heroic Spirit and deity is powerless!
[k]

＠Ishtar
There, Ereshkigal is the absolute law. No matter what you do, you'll get captured and sentenced to skewering, you see?
[k]

？1：King Gilgamesh must be saved!
？2：Time for rescuing, not talking!
