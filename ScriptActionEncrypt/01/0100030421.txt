＠Da Vinci
Right now, you're in the middle of the Age of Exploration.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Many things were imported from the East, and Europe[sr]started advancing into the new land, fighting to gain a foothold.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
One of many things imported from the East were spices.[sr]Nutmeg, cloves, and peppercorns...or pepper.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Pepper was necessary to help eat decomposing meat.[sr]In this era, it was more precious than gold.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Case in point. I just transferred a pepper shaker to you.[sr]What do you think would happen when you hand that to Captain Drake.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Try it.
