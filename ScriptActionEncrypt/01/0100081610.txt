＠Edmond Dantès
That's my line, King of Mages. Are these the desired results after telling mankind to carve their own tombstones?
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
What are these extras? What are these flaws?[sr]What do you call of this mass salvation!?
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
You say joy and sorrow, life and death should all perish? I see, it truly is salvation. What a relief that would be.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Of course, that's something I reject! I'm dying to rip all of you apart! You, who've insulted my anger!
