Most of them ran off from the pain, but about 10% of them continued attacking.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This is what happens when they still have a brain to think, but the only way to stop themselves becomes “death.”

Facing opponents like that has the effect of turning one heartless, as well[line 3]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_6 0.5]I'm impressed, [%1].[sr]You didn't kill a single one.

Although they all fainted in agony.

？1：...Sorry.

＠Da Vinci
Well, you've still kept it together, that's pretty significant too. I have nothing to scold you about.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But we need to get moving. There could be more of them lurking about.
[k]

？1：By the way, can we leave some food?
？2：We still had plenty of supplies, right?

？！

＠Da Vinci
Hm! Did you hear that? What do you think, Mash?[sr]I personally oppose it, but what about you?

Very well. It'll only provide temporary peace of mind, but one sip of water can shine light back into one's life!

Take it, heartless ladies and gentlemen!

You'll likely have forgotten by tomorrow, but consider this half a day of relief!
