The only thing left to do is return to the Chaldean Embassy, get things ready, then head over to the Northern Wall...

Are you staying here, King Gilgamesh? It will be the decisive battle for humanity.

If[line 2]and I do only mean “if”[line 2]you fail to accomplish your task, the next battle will be here in Uruk.

I see. You really are going to be the last line of defense. I always knew Uruk was humanity's oldest fortress city...

＠Merlin
But now I see how it came to be that way. Its roots. Its origin.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Merlin
However, Kingu is on Gorgon's side.
[k]

＠Merlin
He is the complicating factor for this Singularity. Which means he could be a tougher opponent than Gorgon.
[k]

＠Merlin
I think you're the only one who can stop that impostor. But even so, you won't come to the Northern Wall?

I will entrust Quetzalcoatl with intercepting this Kingu! He is not one of the three goddesses. That pact doesn't apply to him.

[k]

＠Merlin
By defeating Gorgon, the crisis will be averted for now. The King of Mages' Grail will be retrieved, and this era will not collapse.

And the job you gave us ends there, right?

Oh, what a joyous occasion. Our once-quiet lounge is now overflowing with people.

I guess this is the result of helping around the city. Food, flowers, booze. They're all gifts from Uruk civilians.
[k]

＠Merlin
I'm sure this crowd is making Ana nervous. I'll go up to her room and check on her.

We have a bit of time till we depart. You guys should relax.

Hey, good work! I heard of your adventures in the underworld! I heard you helped out King Gilgamesh this time?

＠Uruk Civilian
Thanks. On behalf of the citizens of Uruk, we are grateful.
[k]

＠Uruk Civilian
...You know, when this embassy was first made, we were all disgusted, questioning what good outsiders could possibly do...
[k]

＠Uruk Civilian
But we were fools for that! We thought that we should do something to repay you for all you've done.
[k]

＠Uruk Civilian
We talked it over in the market, and next thing you know, well, here we are.
[k]

＠Uruk Civilian
I know it's a bit rowdy right before your departure, but we wanted to see you guys off.

You guys never cease to amaze me. Like that case with the hundred crocodiles living in the river!
[k]

＠E：Uruk Civilian
Nah, that's nothing compared to them getting rid of the beehive at our place. I panicked, thinking that it was the end of the world.
[k]

＠E：Uruk Civilian
It was a swarm of bees that made the room dark as night!

The three varieties from Isin, Umma, and Girsu got all mixed up with no labels, and we couldn't tell them apart.

It'd take three days to sort, but then their flavor would be lost. That's when these folks used their sharp wits...

As you can see, my old age has taken its toll on my eyesight.

＠Old Lady
I didn't think I'd ever walk outside again, but I came here wanting to give thanks one last time.

[seStop ad5 1.0]

Thanks, you say...? You mean, to us?

＠Old Lady
Yes, that's right. To that little girl. That girl really treated me well.
[k]

＠Old Lady
I'm rather stubborn, you see. I kept my flower shop open, pretending not to hear my family's opposition.
[k]

＠Old Lady
Yes, just a formality. I couldn't be at the storefront.[sr]I couldn't attract customers.
[k]

＠Old Lady
My grandchildren were so kind in bringing those flowers to me, but all I did every day was let them wilt. But then that girl came to help me out.
[k]

[charaFace B 13]
＠Old Lady
Sometimes these blind eyes can feel the light. The past few days, I felt like I was young again.
[k]

＠Old Lady
But then I, too, was hit by that illness. I thought I was going to die... until yesterday.
[k]

[charaFace B 12]
＠Old Lady
My family had given up. They had tried to let me depart. I accepted it, thinking I'd lived long enough.
[k]

＠Old Lady
But, that girl clung onto my body. “This lady is still alive so don't bury her,” she said.
[k]

＠Old Lady
That must be why. I was about to disappear in the underworld, but I started to feel like I could live a bit longer.
[k]

[charaFace B 13]
＠Old Lady
When I woke up, she was right at my side. I touched her face for the first time then...
[k]

＠Old Lady
And I was so surprised. I didn't know she was so beautiful. Such a waste to hide it under cloth.
[k]

＠Old Lady
I told her, she would become the most beautiful girl in town, and that's why she should keep her head up...
[k]

＠Old Lady
But I really am getting old. I should have at least given her a floral headpiece.
[k]

＠Old Lady
So today, I came out by myself. I wanted to give this to her, to say thanks for everything.

That girl was quiet, awkward, and timid.

But with you folks nearby, I'm sure she had a lot of fun.

We hope so, yes. That'd make us happy too. Thank you so much, ma'am.

Thank you for being kind to Ana. I'm sure she was happy to have met someone like you too.

You think so? Well, then my long life was worth living.

Even though I'm an old woman whose time is almost up, I was able to help someone else again...
