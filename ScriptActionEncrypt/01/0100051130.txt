You're absolutely correct. A nurse who takes lives would be out of their mind.

Hmm? That means you're actually not crazy? You're quite the respectable Servant!

[line 2]So you are obstructing treatment of an injured man. Obstacles must be eliminated.

I wish for bloodshed.[sr]No, I thirst for it.

If it means saving a patient,[sr]I'll remove all obstacles down to their roots!

I handpicked this one. A bit of a waste to use in skirmishes, but good enough as a test.

It's obvious that we're enemies,[sr]but there are still codes of conduct to follow.

＠Beowulf
I admire those who are strong, even enemies. Fear not death, but extravagance, and never forget honor.
[k]

＠Beowulf
That's the rule of our world. Well, it just means you need to fight, and prove yourself.

＠Beowulf
This world is filled with conflict, and this nation is being swallowed into the mud of war.

＠Beowulf
If you have a problem with that, come and fight. Prove that your life is worth living. Prove that you're warriors.

[charaFace E 1]
＠Beowulf
If you manage that, let's see...[sr]I'll at least remember your names!
