＠Dr. Roman
Who knew something like that would be lurking in the[sr]fog? No wonder nobody's emerged from any buildings.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Since no doors or windows seem to be kicked in,[sr]that must mean they don't break into houses, right?

＠Dr. Roman
Strange.[sr]They're really quite strange.

＠Mash
Yes. What bizarre enemies...[sr]No, I don't think they were living creatures.

I-I see...

＠Dr. Roman
I'm sorry. I won't be able to give you any advance[sr]warning. All of my magical detection readings are in a state of chaos.

＠Mash
I feel the same.[sr]It's just like the city itself...
[k]

＠Mash
Fog, smoke.[sr]It's like there's a layer of mist around everything...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
At any rate, we have to act more cautiously than before.[sr]All right, let's go after that girl.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes... Senpai, let's go.
