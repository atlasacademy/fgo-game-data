Ishtar and Ereshkigal are the goddesses of the heavens and the earth. That makes them good benchmarks for comparison.

＠Ereshkigal
Indeed you have. Do you finally see what a fool you are, Ishtar?
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Your last descent into the underworld ended in failure. So long as that myth exists, you cannot escape the curse of the underworld.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
The crown symbolizing the wilderness, the reed measuring rod, the lapis lazuli choker, the bead necklace, the gold armlet, the gorgeous brooch...
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
And last, the garment of ladyship. I once robbed you of these seven treasures.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
The rule remains unchanged even now. If you don't have an Authority that corresponds to them, you yourself will have to pay the price.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Don't you see? You will become smaller every time you pass through a gate. You will be robbed of your divinity one-seventh at a time.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
By the second gate, you will be a low-rank Divine Spirit. By the fourth gate, you will be even weaker than a gallû.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
And by the end, you'll be a powerless bug. A sad little butterfly that'll be crushed within my hands.

...That is not true. I've given you some mercy at least.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Normally, you and that human would've been dropped into the pits of the underworld the moment you brought the living here.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
However, if you take on the trials of the seven gates, your fate will be decided by the laws of the underworld.

＠Ereshkigal
[%1]. If you've come to defeat me, overcome those trials.

If you safely pass through those seven gates, then I, the ruler of the underworld, shall welcome you here as visitors...

I told you I wouldn't be much use fighting in the underworld, remember? This doesn't really change anything.
[k]

＠Ishtar
You, me, and Gilgamesh too. The moment we reached the underworld, there was nowhere to run.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Before we get used to the cold of the underworld, we need to defeat Ereshkigal and escape. Otherwise Uruk will perish.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Which means we have no choice.[sr]So prepare yourself, [%1].

We're going to have to fight her anyway. Defeating her here would be for the best, really.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Move forward, [%1]. It looks like we don't have much time.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The underworld is part of the present world, but just being here drains your vitality and the strength of your destiny.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The strength of your destiny is, let's see... Think of it as the intrinsic luck necessary to facilitate the continuation of life.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
No matter the life form, we are constantly using this type of luck to avoid mortal danger.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If this significantly drops in a person, they will get into a nasty accident. Like getting hit by a car while on a walk.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The underworld's filled with death, so there's no need for it. It's a world that doesn't need any luck.

Now do you understand how this place works? Then let's hurry up and get to the second gate already.

Although money and riches continue to flow, only one is worthy to own all. Only one can manage the wealth of the world.
