Well, well. I thought they were children, but maybe they're a type of tengu?[sr]Look at them soar through the air...[charaShake D 0.05 2 0 1.0] Mmm, I'm envious.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Oh yes. Especially since the wings on your back are purely ornamental, right, Ibaraki?
[k]

[charaFace G 4]

＠Shuten-Douji
It's just like you to take a form and be satisfied without putting in the substance, Ibaraki. Sometimes I'm embarrassed to be your partner.

I-I never said I was satisfied! I'm still in transition![sr]This is a transitional form!

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Look, eventually, I'll have a folding fan under each arm and become a great oni that even looks down on Rashomon!
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
As soon as I do, I'll steal every last bit of the humans' treasures and dominate their cities in a reign of terror!
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Shuten-Douji
Oh, dear. Why would you say something troublesome like domination? What a pain. Didn't you always say you were going to burn down Kyoto?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Ibaraki-Douji
Mm. I said I would give the humans a hundred harms and not allow a single gain, but I take that back. I'll use them instead.

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Heehee... The capable ones especially would come in handy as my pawns. There is more to sweets than just flavor. They have to look good, too!
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Wait, Shuten! I'll share the best moments with you too!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Then you'll look at me with newfound respect.[sr]It will be like cherry blossoms blooming in the spring!
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
I guarantee you, not even Onikirimaru will be able to sever our bond!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Ibaraki-Douji
That's why we can't let humanity be wiped out! There is no direct profit in it, but we have to protect Chaldea!

It's common for drinkers to prefer a bitter taste, but I like both. At any rate, I won't let your fighting spirit be in vain.

We've got nothing to gain from helping humanity or defending the order of the world, but we can't stand by as the human world is destroyed.

I need good company to enjoy delicious wine. And I think these nasty tentacles would pair nicely with my delicious wine.
