＠Dr. Roman
It's a complete ruin on the inside... The outer wall[sr]is more or less intact, but you can't call this a fort.
[k]

？1：Because it's wartime?

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...No, that would still be impossible.
[k]

？2：Nothing but wounded soldiers here.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
That's right.[sr]Even though they're not in an active war[line 2]

In 1431, Charles VII of France entered a peace treaty with Philip III, an ally of England.
[k]

＠Mash
Of course, I'm sure there were some skirmishes[line 2]

Hm, that was rather easy.[sr]Perhaps they're rational now. Or[line 3]

Why didn't Charles VII sign the peace treaty?
[k]

＠Soldier
King Charles? So you don't know?
[k]

＠Soldier
The king is dead.[sr]He was burned by a witch's flames.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...Dead?[sr]By witch's flames?
[k]

＠Soldier
It's "Jeanne d'Arc."[sr]She has risen again as the "Dragon Witch."
[k]

＠Soldier
England retreated quite a while ago.[sr]But, where have we to run to?
[k]

＠Soldier
This is our home, but there's nothing we can do.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Jeanne d'Arc is a witch?
[k]

？1：Who is Jeanne d'Arc?

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Saint Jeanne d'Arc, the savior.[sr]She is a world-renowned hero.
[k]

＠Mash
A woman who stood up to save France from being conquered in the late stages of Hundred Years' War.
[k]

＠Mash
She saved France at age 17, and managed to reclaim Orleans in just one year...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
But she was caught by the English army,[sr]and after an inquisition, burned at the stake.
[k]

＠Mash
They say that from the time of her imprisonment till her burning, she endured gruesome torture and humiliation daily.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
England wanted to prove that she was not a saint, but a heretic.
[k]

＠Mash
So they tried to torture her into saying[sr]"I did not hear the Lord's voice."
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
[line 3]However, her heart remained true.[sr]Even while burning, she held onto her prayers.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Later, her honor was recognized, and after[sr]400 years she was officially made a saint.
[k]

＠Mash
A powerless girl's wishes changed the world[line 3][sr]In that regard, Jeanne d'Arc is definitely a top-rank Heroic Spirit.
[k]

？2：...
