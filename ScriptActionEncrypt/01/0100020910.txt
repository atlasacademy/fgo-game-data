The soldiers couldn't leave the ship either.[sr]Oh, poor men!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Since the emperor offered to take the wheel herself, I thought she had impeccable skills.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But wait, maybe, just maybe![sr]Those were impeccable skills, in a sense.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I mean, the ship's still standing after such a rocky[sr]journey. It also leapt through waves, and drifted some turns...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]

It's amazing when you think about it.[sr]Just what you'd expect of the emperor...

What in the world...can this even be possible?[sr]Her reading is definitely like a Servant, but different...

？1：What the...

？2：Is she the "ancient god"?

？！

[communicationCharaFace 2]
＠Dr. Roman
An immeasurable divinity level![sr]Without a doubt, she's definitely a god. No, a goddess!

One of the three Gorgon Sisters.[sr]Though, I rather dislike being called an ancient god.

Furthermore, one of "the" ancient Greek gods![sr]That's an authentic god!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]

Is that possible? She is actually standing before you.[sr]Even so, there's no way she can remain "as a god."

＠Dr. Roman
I mean, it's the same for Heroic Spirits.[sr]Her power must've been downsized.
