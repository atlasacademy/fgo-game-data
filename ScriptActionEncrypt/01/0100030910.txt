＠E：???
Excuse me.[sr]I'm coming in, Master.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：???
Hey, what's going on?[sr]My beloved!
[k]

＠E：???
Lord Hektor contacted us.[sr]It seems he caught Euryale.
[k]

＠F：???
I see! I see, I see, I see![sr]All right!
[k]

＠F：???
We were told, if we offer up Euryale,[sr]we can obtain even more power.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠F：???
Me! I'll be more powerful than anyone. I'll be invincible![sr]Wouldn't that be amazing?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠E：???
Yes, very.[sr]I think that would be extremely amazing, Master.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：???
I like your smile. Your smile is like the sun.[sr]It never fails to enrich my heart.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：???
Oh, but you seem a little tired.[sr]Are you all right?
[k]

＠F：???
You've been the ship's power source for so long.[sr]I want you to tell me when it gets too hard.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠F：???
See. Just a bit. If it is just a bit,[sr]I can think about letting you rest.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠E：???
T-Thank you very much! But it's fine.[sr]Your words alone are enough for me to go on.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：???
Perfect[line 3]yes. That's how you should be.[sr]The woman who will become my lovely wife.
[k]

＠F：???
As soon as Hektor returns,[sr]let's go search for "you-know-what."
[k]

＠F：???
I mean, where the hell is it?[sr]You still haven't received any oracle?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠E：???
Correct. I assume that as soon as Lord Hektor returns,[sr]I will receive an oracle showing where we must go.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠F：???
What's with all these problems...[sr]They always keep dragging me down...
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：???
Ah, I'm really sorry.[sr]I don't mean to blame them.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠F：???
But, I have the right to receive these oracles too.[sr]Why is it only you[line 2]?
[k]

＠E：???
...?[sr]What is it, Master?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：???
...Nothing.[sr]Haste makes waste I guess.
[k]

＠F：???
That's right, that must be it. For now, I'll believe in[sr]your oracles, and do my best as the captain.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠E：???
Yes, that is what we hope.[sr]Let's go welcome Lord Hektor.
[k]

＠E：???
We members of Argonautai are undefeatable heroes.[sr]There is no way a random group like theirs can win.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：???
Yes, you're right! We are the strongest![sr]There is no mistake. Our strength is unparalleled!
[k]

＠F：???
We have the world's greatest, strongest hero, and[sr]witch on our side! Oh, and there's one useless woman, too.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠F：???
Hmph, to think someone would vow chastity[sr]to someone like Artemis and reject my invitation like that.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠F：???
Should be a shark's meal by now.[sr]Serves her right.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：???
Now, everybody![sr]Prepare to depart!
[k]

＠F：???
We shall obtain the "Ark." Even the golden ram[sr]pales in comparison to this treasure.
[k]

＠F：???
With the Holy Grail and the "Ark,"[sr]I will reign as the king of Okeanos!

With their head start, unless they stop,[sr]we might not catch up...
