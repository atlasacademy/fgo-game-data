Hmph[line 3]They truly are barbarians. Attempting to contend against me in mass production is the epitome of idiocy.

Eventually my mechanized infantry will cover the land and annihilate the loathsome Celts once and for all.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

However...there is one matter that concerns me.[sr]...Leaders. In other words, we don't have enough Servants.

＠Edison
We have an obedient army,[sr]but no mighty ace warrior to lead them.
[k]

＠Edison
While enemy Celts have many notorious barbarians lined up.
[k]

＠Edison
Just when we gain a foothold somewhere,[sr]we end up losing it to a single Servant.

＠Edison
Only Servants can overcome other Servants. We only have three Servants on our side, including myself.

＠Edison
Other Servants who were summoned are in disarray,[sr]and show no interest in joining us.

Edison, calm down. Florence is just stating her opinion. It's not an accusation.

I'm aware of that. That just now was my usual headache. Don't worry about it.

Listen, Lady Nightingale.

To us... To me, especially, this nation is everything.[sr]And a true king has a paramount duty to protect his nation.

Mr. Edison. If you deny that duty,[sr]you are nothing more than a mere patriot.
[k]

Quite so. What is wrong with a king being a patriot?

Shouldn't you join me to fight the Celts and acquire the Holy Grail? I'll give you three minutes to decide.

What are you saying, Doctor!? He's opposed to the idea of fixing the Foundation of Humanity!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Quite the contrary, he's for it.[sr]It's just that the world he envisions differs from ours.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But we don't have the time to confront him now.[sr]And in the end, I think he'll stop baring his fangs.

I'm not just being hopeful. My conclusion stems from historical observation...and experience.

Those that move nations believing in their own righteousness will experience consequences, in one form or another.

...But that's all irrelevant.[sr]Now is about gaining the upper hand in the war.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
With all the Celtic Servants gathering,[sr]there is an overwhelming gap in military strength.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne and Fionn mac Cumhaill are formidable enough. How many more Servants of that caliber do they have?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
For now, we will cooperate in order to acquire the Holy Grail, and correct the mistake where Celtic myths dominate North America.

＠Dr. Roman
What happens afterwards? We can think about that later.
