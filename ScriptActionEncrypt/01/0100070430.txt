＠Ushiwakamaru
Good morning. I guess we're heading to work at the same hour today.

＠Ushiwakamaru
Siduri, what is Lord [%1]'s task for today?

＠Siduri
Today's request is from Mr. Kissinamuh.
[k]

＠Siduri
His wife has been acting strangely for the past few days, and he'd like you to investigate.
[k]

＠Siduri
To be blunt, you're investigating an affair.

I-investigating an affair?[sr]Um... [charaFace A 3]shouldn't things like that be resolved between the parties involved?

Mr. Kissinamuh is the boss at the armory.[sr]He cannot leave his workplace during the weekdays.
[k]

＠Siduri
But it's all weighing heavily on his mind, and it's affecting his work. An early resolution would be ideal.
[k]

＠Siduri
Also, he needs evidence if it goes to trial. Try to catch her in the act, identify the adulterer, and look into their history.

＠Ushiwakamaru
We are in charge of patrolling Uruk today.[sr]We shall help you out while giving you a tour of the city.

Hahaha, that's the spirit![sr]Of course, I will accompany you too.
[k]

＠Benkei
You should not underestimate the difficulties of investigating an affair.
[k]

＠Benkei
It's normal for the cornered wife to show her devilish side and retaliate by swinging around a giant hatchet when caught in the act.
[k]

＠Benkei
However, my Buddhist power is undiminished in a foreign land. Benkei here will exorcise them without a second thought!
