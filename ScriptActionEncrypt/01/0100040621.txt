＠Mash
You must be tired.[sr]Do you need to rest?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
No, there were just so many of them.[sr]It would be different if there had been a Helter Skelter.

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
It's quite strong. It's probably the only enemy[sr]I've enjoyed fighting during this materialization.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Mash and [%1] have only encountered[sr]it once. It was a tough opponent.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Maybe there aren't that many of them? Come to think,[sr]you covered a lot of ground but haven't seen any.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
Yeah...[sr]Come to think, I've never seen big groups of them.
[k]

＠Mordred
If possible, I'd like to go up against a tough enemy.[sr]I hope we'll see one tonight.
[k]

？1：Now that you've said it, we will.

？2：You're jinxing us.

？！

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
Oh, you think so?

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Why don't we go on a bit further?[sr]There is still some distance to the City's edge.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Um, well, I'm confirming map information...[sr]It's not like I'm particularly familiar with London.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
Well, if something turns up, we'll deal with it then.
