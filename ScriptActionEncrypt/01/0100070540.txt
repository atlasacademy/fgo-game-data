So this is... Ur... It's about the same size as Uruk, but...

It is, but... who are you? Did you cross the river?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Merlin
Yes. We're from Uruk. King Gilgamesh asked us to investigate what's been happening here.
[k]

＠Ur Civilian
Oh, you're from Uruk? That must've been a hard journey. Were you the only survivors from your group?
[k]

＠Ur Civilian
If you were poisoned by snakes or stung by scorpions,[sr]I can refer you to a good doctor.
[k]

＠Merlin
How kind of you. Thankfully, we are uninjured. We're just here to investigate, so our party is small.
[k]

＠Merlin
If the king had known you were alive, he would've sent a large-scale rescue party.
[k]

＠Ur Civilian
A rescue party... I see. I'm sorry. But we aren't evacuating to Uruk.
[k]

＠Ur Civilian
Ur is safe, you see. As long as the jungle surrounds us, the Demonic Beasts can't come in.
[k]

＠Ur Civilian
And as long as we obey the rules of the forest goddess, the Demonic Beasts will not devour us.

...I see. I'm assuming there are no casualties, then? Since this place is relatively safe compared to the rest of Mesopotamia.
[k]

＠Merlin
That's why you never contacted Uruk. Did you think closing yourselves off in Ur was the best course of action?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Ur Civilian
Of course not! We tried to send help to Uruk!
[k]

＠Ur Civilian
But... It was...
[k]

＠Merlin
A violation of the rules set by the forest goddess you speak of. I see.
[k]

＠Merlin
You are safe, but at the same time you cannot leave Ur. Anyone who comes to help, or leaves to help, is killed by the forest.
[k]

＠Merlin
So Ur's plan to defend itself is to do nothing at all.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Ur Civilian
...Yes. I'm glad you understand.
[k]

＠Merlin
Yes, I understand. If you don't resist, you can survive.
[k]

＠Merlin
That's the mentality of those who have given up.[sr]So, how many are chosen as sacrifices?
[k]

＠Merlin
I assume it's one person a day?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Ur Civilian
...! Wh-what are you talking about? There are no sacrifices[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Merlin
I can tell just by looking around. There are far too few men.
[k]

＠Merlin
Ur is not at war, so that is strange. Which means there must be another reason they're gone.

Even with the people of Ur working together we're no match against that goddess! And negotiations do not work!

This is bad. I understand how Lady Mash feels, but I wish she could've controlled herself for a few more minutes.

See? All the other townspeople have fled into their homes out of guilt.

At this point, we're intruders. It'll take time to persuade them. I wanted to get a little more info from them.

But... It's true that I hurt her. She's suffering far more than I am, yet I...

Any warriors who have failed the trial of strength are forced into hard labor at Eridu!
