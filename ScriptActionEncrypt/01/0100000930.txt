This place looks like a natural cave...[sr]Did this always exist in Fuyuki City?

＠Olga Marie
Probably, it's half natural, half man-made. It's the[sr]underground workshop expanded by mages over a number of years.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Anyway, Caster.[sr]I forgot to ask you something important.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Do you know Saber's True Name?[sr]It sounded like you'd fought several times.

＠Caster
Yes, I know it. Anyone who gets hit by Saber's Noble Phantasm will find out that bastard's True Name...
[k]

＠Caster
The other Servants were all defeated because Saber's Noble Phantasm was that powerful.

A powerful Noble Phantasm, is it?[sr]What was it like?
[k]

＠Caster
The sister sword of the Sword in the Stone.[sr]It's the most famous sacred sword in your time period.
[k]

＠Caster
Its name...
[k]

＠Servant
The Sword of Promised Victory, Excalibur.[sr]Wielded by King Arthur, the proud King of Knights.

Ah, speak of the devil. Or shall I say, the faithful follower.[sr]As always, I see that you're still the loyal knight.

In other words, you're the gatekeeper. I don't know why[sr]you're protecting Saber, but let's end this here.

From the way you talk, I think you understand the[sr]circumstances. Yet you are still absorbed by your own desires...

You still haven't changed despite being a mage now.[sr]In that case, I will knock some sense into you.

He's an Archer. Without your shield,[sr]I won't have the time to cast my spells.
[k]

＠Mash
Ah...R-Right![sr]Sorry, I was out of it for a second there.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
But no problem, I can do this.[sr]When it comes to guarding, leave it to me!
