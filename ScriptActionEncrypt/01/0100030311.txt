Hey, hey, [%1] and Mash.[sr]Got a second?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes, what is it?

＠Drake
Those people we took out have vanished.[sr]In your eyes, is that possible?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...True, they have disappeared.[sr]Doctor?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yes, just as I thought. Seems like it's the[sr]concept of pirates that exist in these waters.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Concept, you say?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A type of spiritual body etched in the memories of the[sr]"Age of Exploration." They can only act to fulfill their roles.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They have their own will, but are models of an idea.[sr]Call them an infinite copy of the "average pirate."
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They do little damage, but unless the world is corrected,[sr]these "bugs" will keep spawning forever.
[k]

＠Drake
...What do you mean by that?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
If I had to sum it up in a single word,[sr]those pirates are like... Ghosts.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
...But, they took damage from bullets, you know?[sr]Not just mine either, from the scallywags as well.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Sorry, let me rephrase that.[sr]Think of them as ghosts with physical bodies.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
S-So they have physical bodies. Then we're okay![sr]There's no problem!
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes, that's correct.[sr]Now, let us be on our way!
