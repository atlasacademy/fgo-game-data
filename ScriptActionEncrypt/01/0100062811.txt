＠Gawain
Hurry with the message! Tell the soldiers on the wall to only aim for enemies directly below us!

＠Gawain
I know even that's difficult in a storm like this, but that's better than accidentally shooting one of our own!

Sir Gawain, the Third Unit at the right flank is requesting backup! A strange cavalryman is running amok!

Grain? What a waste to use for attacks! It's probably an enemy Servant, do not engage!

Sir Mordred's unit is on its way. Hold your ranks until they arrive!

Tell everyone at the left flank to retreat and regroup with the Fourth Unit. After that, you are to rally with the troops at the right flank.
