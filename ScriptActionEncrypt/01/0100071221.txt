So, we've arrived at Ur.

I know it was a wild trip, but I appreciate [%1]'s kindness for not asking about my minions!

Uh-huh. At a glance, it looked as though they were being murdered, right? But she wasn't killing them.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Well, she is actually killing them, but right after giving them a killer move, she's casting a killer revive on them. That girl.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Jaguar Warrior
It's Kuku's bad habit, or kind of like her policy? I personally don't get showing mercy in a match like that.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
She takes on anyone who's ready to risk their lives to challenge her, but she helps those who aren't ready to die.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
That's why she gets taken advantage of by Tezca.[sr]And yet she still just doesn't learn.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
As a big sis, I'm worried that the other goddesses will walk all over her if she doesn't change.

＠Jaguar Warrior
Now, now, don't say that. Ur is pretty fun too. The residents look a little down, but that's not important.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
There're two kinds of people! The ones who can make it, and the ones who can't! That doesn't change no matter what era we're in.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
But, that's why humans have thrived for a long time☆ If each and every person could work THAT hard, it'd be kind of scary.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Jaguar Warrior
“There are ones who can fight, and ones who cannot.” “That difference in capacity is a trait seen only among human society.”

[charaFace A 3]

That's what Kuku was saying. Well, it doesn't matter to me though.

＠Dr. Roman
...Kuku... So you were talking about Kukulkan.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Quetzalcoatl was the priest-king of the Toltecs. To the Mayans, he was the conquering king, Kukulkan.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Quetzalcoatl was a god, but also appeared at times as a king of men.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So that goddess may be inheriting all of that memory and history...

＠Merlin
It means she's not quite like Gorgon. She understands what human beings are, but chooses to destroy them nonetheless.
[k]

＠Merlin
Well, that's complicated in itself, but how about it, [%1]? You think you'll be able to talk to her?
[k]

？1：...I do, yes.
？2：...I don't know.

＠Jaguar Warrior
Hmm, I think that's impossible. Gorgon is the goddess of the north, right?
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Quetzalcoatl is also a goddess of war. If she shows her true self, she becomes much more terrifying than Gorgon.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Jaguar Warrior
Kuku is a monster who enjoys fighting. She sounds cheery, but that's because she's in a good mood.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
But imagine what'll happen if the fun is taken out of it. All she'll be is a cold killing machine afterwards.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Words alone could never defeat Quetzalcoatl.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
The only thing that could silence her would be a head-on battle of the soul.

＠Ishtar
So Ur turned out to be like this, huh. Compared to Uruk, though, the people are kind of morose.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Ishtar
...But this is how things are supposed to be. Not all humans are strong.
[k]

＠Ishtar
There are people who try, but it just doesn't work. That's not because they're not brave enough, or they're weaklings.
[k]

＠Ishtar
They're just not fit to do certain things.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Gilgamesh and Quetzalcoatl don't understand that.[sr]No, they don't even try to understand it.
[k]

＠Ishtar
If only the strong and glorious are accepted in this world, the weak and frightened ones will have no place.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I'm not saying you need to protect them because they're weak. It's just that some things can only be seen from their perspective.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I don't want to ignore that fact.[sr]I want everything to be fair.
[k]

？1：Ishtar, you're fussy.

[charaFace G 3]
＠Ishtar
R-really? I didn't realize... But it's true I don't like dirty things.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Although, I love bones... I don't like animal guts and stuff like that though.
[k]

？2：Jaguar Warrior said the same thing.

[charaFace G 10]
＠Ishtar
...Jaguar Warrior, really... You recruited another new Servant again.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Well, I don't really care. Maybe just a little irritated, that's all.

I came to give you some advice tonight. To plan against Quetzalcoatl.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Ishtar
...Hey. Were you trying to run away again when I was trying to be nice and tell you something?
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_11 0.1]
[charaFace G 4]
＠Ishtar
That's just my imagination? The fruit water is good? ...O-okay, if you say so...
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠Ishtar
Anyway! Listen carefully to my suuuuuuper helpful advice!
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Ishtar
Ready? She is a god of good, the apex of all things good. If you think about it, that means nothing good can work on her.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The only things that could really harm her would have to be evil. That's why if you get into battle, use an evil Servant to fight against her.
[k]

＠Ishtar
That way, you'll at least be able to fight better than before. No matter what happens, just don't rely on me!
[k]

？1：Ah, I see...!
？2：You sure are a goddess!

？！

[charaFace G 1]
＠Ishtar
Yes, of course! I am the greatest and wisest goddess of Mesopotamia!
[k]

？1：But aren't you a little naive?

？！

[charaFace G 3]
＠Ishtar
W-well... Maybe just a little.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I'm usually at the temple, so all I knew of the outside world was what I'd heard.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Ishtar
I was given a job as soon as I was born, so I didn't have any freedom...
[k]

＠Ishtar
You're seriously the first person to have a conversation with me like this as a friend...
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Ishtar
That's why I couldn't turn a blind eye, so I'm helping you out like this...
[k]

？1：I'm honored to be your very first friend.
？2：I can't turn a blind eye to you either.

？！

[charaFace G 11]

[k]

＠Ishtar
I-is that so? I...hadn't thought about that. But maybe it's not so bad to have a friend...
