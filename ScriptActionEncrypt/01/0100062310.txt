＠Holmes
You must be [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].[sr]And she is Ms. Kyrielight.
[k]

＠Holmes
She is the Servant Xuanzang Sanzang.[sr]He is the Servant Tawara Touta.
[k]

＠Holmes
And that is... Well well, what a surprise.[sr]A Knight of the Round Table is also among you.
[k]

＠Holmes
Wonderful to meet you, Sir Bedivere. As we share a homeland, it's hard not to feel a certain familiarity with you already.
[k]

？1：How do you know my name already!?
？2：How did you know everyone's True Name...

？！
[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Why? Elementary, my dear friends.

You and I have already made contact. Before we met face to face, we met through information.

＠Holmes
In London, you managed to safely acquire the information I left at the Mage's Association, right?
[k]

＠Holmes
It was just paperwork, but it must've been worth a thousand pounds to you at the time.
[k]

＠Holmes
I gathered only the necessary information, and arranged it so it'd be easy to read.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
At that point, you must've accepted me as a collaborator in the shadows.
[k]

？1：Now that you mention it...
？2：Wasn't Andersen saying something about...?

？！

[charaTalk A]

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Mash
Yes. He said someone had organized the information before he looked it up!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
So that was your doing, Mr. Holmes!

＠Holmes
Yes. Had I made it too easy to understand, Makiri would have noticed.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
I arranged it so that it would only make sense when a wise person with a true purpose searched for it.
[k]

＠Holmes
You needed to know it in order to solve this murder case and not just be a passive bystander.
[k]

？1：...Murder case?

？！

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
Yes, it's a murder case, and one on a scale I've never experienced before: “The complete murder of the primates by means of the Incineration of Humanity.”
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Yes indeed, a mythological murder case...[sr]Obviously I'd appear!

＠Bedivere
Who is he? Holmes... I don't remember a knight by that name...

How sad.

＠Holmes
It's true that I never attained knighthood.[sr]The person who recorded my efforts, however, did.

His class is... probably Caster, right?[sr]He is one of the true forefathers of all detectives.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Oh, if only the monitor was alive, the Doctor would've been overjoyed!
[k]

＠Mash
And, I am especially moved as well![sr]Sherlock Holmes was real!
[k]

＠Mash
In other words, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels were biographies by Dr. Watson!

＠Holmes
Heh. Watson's side job. If it makes an innocent girl so openly happy, then our work was well worth it.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
But Ms. Kyrielight. My true identity, my essence, is slightly different from what you may think.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Holmes
And sad, but that is not the purpose of our gathering here today.
[k]

＠Holmes
I cannot yet accept your case, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Oh... you can't?
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
Mr. Holmes, you appeared in person, without even a disguise, so I assumed...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Holmes
Hahahahaha! What a good fan![sr]You're very aware of my personality!

＠Holmes
...Phew. I would very much like to cooperate, too, but there's a case I must solve first.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
Sir Babbage asked me to do so.
[k]

＠Holmes
He only had a little bit of reason left in him, just a speck, but it was like a glittering star. It is in exchange for that.
[k]

＠Holmes
Until that case is closed, I cannot make ties with Chaldea.
[k]

＠Holmes
But that is not a vital problem.[sr]I'll leave the battle to you heroes.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
I am a detective. I have no interest in justice or honor.[sr]I just solve mysteries. That is my duty.

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

Yes, that's exactly it! Although I did activate the pitfall and invite you all!

？2：What sort of mysteries do you mean?

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Holmes
Yes. I came to this institute in search of knowledge.
[k]

＠Holmes
The Old Man of the Mountain must've talked about needing to know everything, right?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
In that case, you should head for the central area of this institute. I, too, have business there.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
It is far from here, about half a mile underground. The path twists and folds over itself, much like a labyrinth.
[k]

＠Holmes
I'll show you the way there, and you'll eliminate the traps with your strength.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Holmes
It's quite the efficient collaboration.[sr]Now, let's hurry. Infinite knowledge awaits us!
