＠Boudica
Ah.[sr]...I must say, I am happy to be proven wrong about you.
[k]

＠Boudica
You showed me how competent you are. Thanks,[sr]I know you must be exhausted from your travels.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
My defense and Spartacus's offense matches pretty[sr]well. You held your own against us, I underestimated you!
[k]

＠Boudica
As for you... Mash? You're a shield-wielding[sr]Heroic Spirit, right? I really like you.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Boudica
I know it's twisted to have a weapon solely for defense, but it's far better than one solely for killing.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
I mean, how can you be so reliable when you're so slim?

Fou?

＠Mash
R-Reliable?
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Boudica
Yes, when you wielded your shield and stood your[sr]ground... It was like you'd taken root.
[k]

＠Boudica
If Lord Nero is the violence of fire, then you're the riches[sr]of the earth. I think you'd be compatible with any Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
...Right.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Boudica
Yes, good answer.[sr]Indeed, indeed.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
Hmm...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Boudica
Hmm, hmm. (staring)
[k]

＠Boudica
Hmm, hmm, hmm. (staring)
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
E-Excuse me?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
Now that I look at you carefully, yes, I see. So that's[sr]what it is. If that's the case, you should have just told me!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Excuse me?
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Boudica
Things are getting complicated, aren't they?[sr]Even we...Ah, I just noticed. How adorable!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Huh?
[k]

＠Boudica
Come here. Come on.[sr]There, there.

Ah[line 2]W-What is it, Boudica?[sr]Augh...What's with you all of a sudden...
[k]

[charaDepth A 1]
[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
You're like a little sister to me.[sr]Maybe both of you are. There, there.
[k]

[charaDepth A 1]
＠Boudica
I'm so proud of you, coming from a faraway time period.[sr]You're so strong. There, there.
[k]

？1：She's like an aunt... or big sister.

？2：Boudica's chest is mashing Mash...

？！

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
U-Um, y-your chest...[sr]I can't breathe...
[k]

[charaDepth A 1]
[charaFace G 3]
＠Boudica
Mmm, good girl, good girl!
[k]

[charaDepth A 1]
[charaFace G 4]
＠Boudica
You called yourself Nero's ally so I was on my guard for a bit, sorry!
[k]

[charaDepth A 1]
[charaFace G 3]
＠Boudica
But now I'm in a great mood! All right, tonight[sr]I'll make you something wonderful to eat!
[k]

[charaDepth A 1]
[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
Your big sister here is really good at cooking[sr]Britannia cuisine. You'll eat it, won't you?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
T-Thank you...[sr]Senpai, how about you? Are you hungry?
[k]

？1：Famished.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I know, right?[sr]Actually, me too.
[k]

？2：I'm just completely exhausted.

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
Ah... I-I know, right?[sr]I'm exhausted from traveling, too. I'm sorry!
[k]

？！

[charaDepth A 1]
[charaFace G 3]
＠Boudica
Yes, yes! Eat, eat, and then go to sleep![sr]That's the key to having plenty of energy!
[k]

[charaDepth A 1]
[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
Even if you don't like it, I'll force you to eat![sr]Then after dinner[line 2]
[k]

[charaDepth A 1]
＠Boudica
Of course, we should take a bath![sr]I'll even wash your back.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Huh?
[k]

[charaDepth A 1]
[charaFace G 5]
＠Boudica
I hate to admit this, but Roman baths are the best in the[sr]world. It goes to show that even Nero can be useful.
[k]

[charaDepth A 1]
[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
It feels amazing. Even Spartacus calms down[sr]when he's immersed in hot water.
[k]

＠Mash
Huh?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
U-Um...[sr]I think you can let go of me now...
[k]

[charaDepth A 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Berserkers calm down when they're immersed in[sr]hot water... This is a discovery Mash!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
No, it's not.
[k]

＠Mash
No...
