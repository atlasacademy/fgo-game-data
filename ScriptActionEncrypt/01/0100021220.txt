＠Alexander
...Is it over?
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Alexander
All right, let's talk. We need to hurry,[sr]or both your soldiers and mine will die off.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Alexander
It's not my intention.[sr]That's why[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Alexander
[line 4]C'mon. "Let's talk."
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
...I don't understand, not one bit.[sr]At the very least, my men were killed by your army!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
It's happening even now.[sr]Knowing that...
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
...Are you still saying your purpose is to talk?[sr]You bastard!
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Alexander
Yes.
[k]

＠Alexander
I do believe that human lives are sacred.[sr]Even I believe that.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Alexander
But you see, I think that this is the best way.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Alexander
Because you caught my attention[sr]Fifth Emperor of the Roman Empire, Nero Claudius.
[k]

＠Alexander
Why is it[line 2][sr][line 2]that you fight?
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Alexander
Why would you not show allegiance to the United[sr]Empire, and keep fighting like that? No, "like this."
[k]

＠Alexander
If you chose to be one of the united "emperors,"[sr]you could've avoided many unnecessary conflicts.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
Unnecessary...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Did you call this fight unnecessary?[sr]How dare you.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Alexander
I did. So what are you going to do?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
...I won't forgive you.
[k]

＠Nero
It doesn't matter if you're my resurrected kin...[sr]or a wise ruler from the past...
[k]

＠Nero
Or a brave general from an ancient era...[sr]or even if you're a legendary king yourself...
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
The only one suitable to be emperor[sr]is none other than Nero Claudius!
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 0.4]
[bgm BGM_EVENT_3 0.1]
＠Nero
Loved by the people, allowed to love them, wanted[sr]by them... There is only one! The one and only ruler!
[k]

＠Nero
A shining star like so![sr]Arrogant to carry all the burden like so!
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
Even if all the Gods of Rome descend and tell her[sr]to surrender to the United Empire, she'll never back down!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
How can I back down! Such is my life to[sr]believe in this philosophy, such is my fate!
[k]

＠Nero
I won't back down, I will rule and I will prosper[sr]gloriously. I am, without a doubt, Rome itself!
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Alexander
Splendid![sr]That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Alexander
You pass. Go forth and become a ruler.[sr]No, an emperor! You have the right to do so!
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Alexander
A rose that attracts glory and prosperity! A sin only[sr]allowed for humans, a Beast that shows the number of the Fallen.
[k]

＠Alexander
You can even "become the Devil!"[sr]Yes, you!
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
Shut up, shut up, shut up![sr]You don't need to say any more, so!
[k]

＠Nero
Mash, [%1]! I need your help.[sr]Take this bastard[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
[line 2]down!
