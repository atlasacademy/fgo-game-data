Hold back?[sr]Of course not.

＠Berserk Rider
This is fine, it's fine this way.[sr]Seriously, don't make a saint massacre you!

＠Berserk Rider
...Listen, let me tell you one last thing. You'll never beat the dragon controlled by the Dragon Witch.
[k]

＠Berserk Rider
There's only one way to surpass that type of dragon.[sr]Go to Lyon...the city once known as Lyon.
[k]

＠Berserk Rider
It won't be a saint who defeats the dragon, nor a[sr]princess. Ever since ancient times, only a "Dragon Slayer" is capable of killing a dragon.

＠Berserk Rider
Tarasque, I'm sorry.[sr]...Next time, I hope I'll be summoned properly.

She'd undergone Madness Enhancement, in addition[sr]to being summoned. Perhaps it can't be helped.
[k]

＠Mash
Normally it would be impossible to even talk to her.
[k]

＠Mash
The only reason we were able to communicate was because of her incredible self-control.

Yes. She was a peaceful, yet fierce as a person.[sr]I could tell.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
She is the Iron Saint. She is a woman like adamantite,[sr]who solves things with her fists in the end.

They say she defeated the Tarasque with a sermon, but I bet she just beat it up.
[k]

Anyway, thanks to her, we know where we're going.

We should hurry, right?[sr]Let's get going to Lyon.

...I'm surprised. Amadeus seemed like, um, the type of person who'd hate to travel on foot...

Oh no, Amadeus loves traveling.[sr]He's traveled to many places ever since he was a child.
