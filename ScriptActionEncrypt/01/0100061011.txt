“Amazing! Wonderful! I cannot find the words to express my gratitude! Can anything else be this joyful?” Those were your words, yes?

＠Cursed Arm
Salia was originally from this village. Her father opposed, but she married into a family in the Holy Land.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
...What irony. It was a past I discarded, a tale that had no connection with me as a Heroic Spirit...
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
To think I've been summoned into the era I originally lived in. ...This is rough. Too rough for the inexperienced...

I must prepare a place for our new friends to stay. With 50 people, perhaps the entire village should help me...

Aren't you exhausted from the trip? I'll show you our village. We lead a frugal life, though, so we can't give a welcome toast...
