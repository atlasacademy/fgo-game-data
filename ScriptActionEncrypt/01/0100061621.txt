[%1]. Our mission is to defeat the Lion King. Your mission is to face him.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
I'd say they are practically the same.[sr]The Lion King would never leave the Holy City.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
To get inside, we'll need to defeat their knights and get past that front gate.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Hundred Personas
We will soon launch a full-scale attack on the city with a united force consisting of those that have lost their families and their stake in the Holy Land.
[k]

When we do, we want your help.[sr]Please lend us a hand.

You've fought in a war in America, but it might be your first time trying to capture a city that size.

＠Dr. Roman
I wonder if it will go our way.

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_2 1.0]

How many troops can you gather to attack the Holy City? If you simply go and attack, you're asking to get defeated.

How true. You are right in that our forces are not that formidable.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
Right now, half of the villages have agreed to join the attack. We have about 7,000 soldiers who can fight at the front.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
The Holy City soldiers are also less than 10,000 in number, but their training is what makes the difference. All the soldiers there are really tough.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
We need three of our soldiers to match one of theirs.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
And if the Knights of the Round Table join the fray, normal soldiers wouldn't even stand a chance.

Hm... We should have more Servants than they do though. There are five Knights of the Round Table who survived the fight with the Crusaders.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
Lancelot, Gawain, Tristan, Mordred, and Agravain.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
On our end, we have eight.

＠Tawara Touta
Mash, Bedivere, Arash, Hassan, Hassan, Hassan, me, and Sanzang.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Tawara Touta
Wait, Sanzang is practically useless on the battlefield, so seven. Even so, [charaFace C 2]our Servants can still match with theirs.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
In that case, why don't we launch the assault by ourselves?

It's not that, Lord Touta. Our fight is to take back the Holy Land.
[k]

＠Arash
Simply defeating the Knights of the Round Table wouldn't suffice. I mean, that whole 3-on-1 thing...
[k]

＠Arash
The same applies to us too.[sr]I witnessed the fight with Mordred...
[k]

＠Arash
The Knights of the Round Table all seem to be protected by some kind of strange power. I'm not even sure if three of us would be able to defeat one of them.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

...Hm. If Lord Arash puts it that way. I guess now is not the time to rejoice over a worthy opponent.

Unless we have a Noble Phantasm that shares the same attribute as, say, Lancelot's Arondight, we can't even defend against him.

Using a sword to defend against attack...[sr]Does that mean its attribute is similar to my shield?
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Bedivere
No, Lady Mash. Your Noble Phantasm's attribute is one of a kind.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Also, Sir Lancelot's sword is an Anti-Personnel Noble Phantasm.
[k]

I can't explain it well, but in terms of fighting with Sir Gawain, Sir Lancelot is the best match.
