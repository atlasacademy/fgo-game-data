Everything's burnt down far as the eye can see...[sr]There aren't any traces of residents either. What happened here?

＠Olga Marie
What could even turn Chaldea gray in the first place?[sr]If we can't see the future, that means humanity will vanish...
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Could that mean the Counter Force doesn't work in a[sr]Singularity? Then this place is like a Bolt...
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The fatal choice of destruction scattered throughout[sr]human history... When your choices become mistakes, this is what happens.

Looks like the Director is talking to herself again.[sr]This could take a while.

＠Dr. Roman
Hey [%1], looks like it's safe over[sr]there. Why don't you rest a bit?

＠Mash
I agree with you, Doctor.[sr]Senpai, would you like some rations?
[k]

？1：Thanks. Aren't you tired, Mash?

？2：Sure, but how are you, Mash?

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Tired? Are you asking if I've been having any problems since I became a Servant?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
...Well, for the most part.[sr]It's scary to fight, but I'm doing fine otherwise.
[k]

？1：Are you okay with me being your Master?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Of course.[sr]I think you might've been the best Master this summer.
[k]

？2：Any complaints since you've become a Servant?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
It's hard to explain.[sr]Imagine yourself becoming a jet fighter.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
You might be able to fly around in the sky, but you can't do your own maintenance.
[k]

＠Mash
No matter how strong you might be, your existence essentially depends on having a Master.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...The risk and reward makes sense here. But I can't be[sr]too happy when I think of the burden I'm putting on you.
