What are you talking about?[sr]I just dropped by while I was out for a stroll.

I freely overlook Uruk, freely pluck my bow, and freely ravage the lands.

＠Ishtar
See you, oh shirtless King of Uruk.[sr]Have fun with the Demonic Beasts up north.

＠Ishtar
And Siduri. When Gilgamesh dies, it's not like I won't save Uruk, so keep a white flag ready.

Just a little more and I would've had the anti-Ishtar net launched... Curses.

It seems so. As long as Maanna, the Boat of Heaven, is around, it will be difficult to capture Ishtar.

Well, fine, let's get back to work. We've lost a lot of time. Let's work harder, Siduri.

Oh. I thought that was what I said. Yes, Gilgamesh is a wise king. He shed his warrior persona to become a mage instead.
[k]

＠Merlin
To protect Uruk, nay, the Mesopotamian world, he sheds his holy blood as a mage,
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

He has become a more reasonable, regal, reliable version of King Gilgamesh!

I must protect my people, borders, and our way of life...[sr]I must fight with all of Mesopotamia.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Gilgamesh
That is why I locked away my treasures and took up a staff. Summoning that half-blood mage there was also part of the plan.

This is the real Heroic Spirit summon, unlike the summons of Chaldea.

It'd probably help to mention that this is the end of the Age of Gods. Summoning is much easier here than in your time.

Now, if we were in the 21st century, with magecraft diminishing, even the king or I wouldn't find it easy to summon a Heroic Spirit.

So there you have it. Your actions are utterly arrogant,

but that summoning system was created with talent equal to godly skill. I will not mock the effort, research, and miracles put towards it.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Gilgamesh
That, and the shred of hope it offered you. Humph[line 3]You have done well in the first six Singularities.

However, those eras are not this one.[sr]I do not need you all.

If you still say you want to assist me, you may do so by working your way up from the bottom.

I assist the king as well as manage the Ritual Sect.

＠Siduri
Oh... How embarrassing. So you noticed.[sr]I didn't understand what Ishtar meant by that earlier...
[k]

＠Siduri
A white flag... I see. So it is a sign of surrender in your country...

＠Siduri
...You may perhaps be from the same country as the girl who became Ishtar's vessel.

Therefore, I shall give you some advice.
[k]

＠Siduri
The king has said you are not needed. However, he did not use the words “worthless” or “meaningless.”
[k]

＠Siduri
Therefore, if you would like for the king to listen, having some noteworthy achievements would be helpful.

Go and help with the various jobs in the city.[sr]I believe the king would want that.
[k]

＠Siduri
So, basically you'd be a jack-of-all-trades.[sr]I will go and make the job arrangements for you.

＠Siduri
Because the king ordered me to take care of you.[sr]It's not often he says something like that.
[k]

＠Siduri
I cannot understand yet, but you must be worth at least that much to him.
[k]

＠Siduri
Therefore, as his assistant, I shall trust in his word.
[k]

＠Siduri
Please lead a righteous life, one even an incompetent being like me would be able to understand. That shall be my reward as well.
[k]

＠Siduri
That is how this country runs. We don't have many resources, so there isn't much in the way of entertainment.
[k]

＠Siduri
For Uruk, ale, sheep, and people's smiles are what give everyone the energy to survive.
