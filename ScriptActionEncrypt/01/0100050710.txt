＠Geronimo
Sorry to do this while we walk,[sr]but let me explain the situation again.
[k]

＠Geronimo
I have confirmed the presence of two Servants, both Archers. You'll have to ask them for their True Names.
[k]

＠Geronimo
...Both are infamous Servants who specialize in guerrilla warfare.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Unless they run into a particularly powerful enemy, they are unlikely to lose in combat.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Geronimo
But they're at a big disadvantage in terms of numbers.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Even though these Archers excel at guerrilla warfare, the best they can achieve is reducing the extent of the damage.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Celtic soldiers are laying waste to the land as they please. Such savagery is easy to identify.

Savagery... As they please...[sr]Are they not all united in one group?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Geronimo
Not objectively speaking. But, it's obvious that their purpose is seizing control of this land.
[k]

＠Geronimo
So they probably have one objective, but how they accomplish that is left up to each individual.
[k]

＠Geronimo
The literature suggests that Celtic soldiers can be downright vicious and ferocious.

...Indeed.

＠Rama
As far as I saw, Cú Chulainn massacred all opposing soldiers.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Rama
His nickname is “Child of Light?” What a joke.[sr]He's truly fallen into darkness already... Ugh!
[k]

？1：By the way, what happened to you, Rama?
？2：Rama, why are you being carried like that?

[%1]. Please try not to disturb the patient.
[k]

＠Nightingale
This is an emergency transportation device I devised. It's not a mere body bag. It's a Rama bag.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Rama
U-Ugh... To be carted around by a woman... How humiliating.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Gender and age are irrelevant for patients. Do not forget that you have a severe injury and cannot walk.

[line 3]Well.
[k]

＠Geronimo
The Western American army forces civilians into factories, making them work on the mechanized infantry's mass production.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Wow. Edison has become a dictator.
[k]

＠Geronimo
I heard many have sought refuge for the time being, saying it's better than being slain by the Celts.
[k]

＠Geronimo
The war between the East and the West is at a stalemate. While it's a relief that we don't need to worry about the civilians at this stage...
