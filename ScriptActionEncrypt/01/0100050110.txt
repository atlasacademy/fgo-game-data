...Whew. The Rayshift was successful, Senpai.

＠Mash
We're in a forest somewhere in America in the year 1783.
[k]

＠Mash
...To be precise, we are on the continent of North America... The United States hasn't been born yet.
[k]

＠Mash
Once the Revolutionary War against England ends this year, the nation later known as “America” will be established.
[k]

＠Mash
After that, this nation will turn into a monster-like mega power that dominates this world.
[k]

＠Mash
Whether that's good or not, there's no doubt that this nation is absolutely essential for the proper course of history.
[k]

？1：Is England the enemy?
？2：Who is the enemy?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Let's say America loses the war, and the nation known as the United States never comes into existence.
[k]

＠Mash
...Right, though that certainly is a possibility, the mere result of the Revolutionary War won't change the flow of history.
[k]

＠Mash
As long as America has shown its will for independence, even if that process gets delayed for 30 to 50 years...
[k]

＠Mash
Eventually the United States of America will be established.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I don't think it's as simple as “England is our enemy.”
