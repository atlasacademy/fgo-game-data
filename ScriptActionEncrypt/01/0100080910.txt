＠Nightingale
Then I shall answer.
[k]

＠Nightingale
It is natural for humans to be moved to grieve for war and to honor those who have fallen. But, we must also move beyond that.
[k]

＠Nightingale
That's right. Instead of remaining steadfast and stagnant, believing all is well, we must extinguish war's smoldering flames.

＠Rama
Yes, exactly! You all do your grieving and your honoring, but fail to go beyond that.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Rama
Now you are ready to throw the whole world into the wastebasket, as if cleaning up a child's scattered toys!
[k]

＠Rama
This is the inane logic of a coward, one who can accept neither his own faults, nor anyone else's!
[k]

＠Rama
I am Rama, King of Kosala! Henceforth, my whole spirit shall become [%1]'s shield!

Oh, Rama. Have your wounds healed?

＠Rama
Obviously. At my current strength, I could defeat Ravana one-handed!

＠Nightingale
Pride goes before a fall.[sr]This Demon God Pillar is like a pathogen.
[k]

＠Nightingale
To annihilate it, we would have to destroy the entire world. However, we do not have such power.

And so, treating the symptoms should be enough for now. The one with the cure for the disease is not us,[sr]but[line 3]

Now, we fight! No matter how many injuries you suffer, do not be afraid.

＠Rama
The Angel is with us!

Even if you're at death's door or about to fall into the abyss of hell, she'll pull you back up by the collar!
