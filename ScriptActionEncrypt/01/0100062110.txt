Hm!? It should be around here, but I see no sign or trace of it! Not even a building to serve as a guide!
[k]

＠Bedivere
Distance and direction are both correct! No one at the Round Table can match my sense of direction when traveling! Believe me!
[k]

＠Bedivere
I am confident of that! Well, unless what that man said was wrong! In that case we're out of luck!

＠Mountain People
A message from Lord Hundred Personas:
[k]

＠Mountain People
“Listen up, you all. The place you're looking for is Ozymandias's favorite ruin.”
[k]

＠Mountain People
“It's a place that Ozymandias has no power over, a building that even he can't investigate.”
[k]

＠Mountain People
“Lately, an odd figure has been frequently spotted around it. This is also very interesting.”
[k]

＠Mountain People
“They say he wears a black cape and a turban, and that he is from the western lands. I hope that helps you identify him.”
[k]

＠Mountain People
“Use this map to find the location. Leave it to me. I'm an expert when it comes to the desert.”
[k]

＠Mountain People
“P.S. Ozymandias's divine beasts wander around the ruin. Don't fight them!”
[k]

＠Mountain People
...The message ends there. There is one more report from Lord Hundred Personas about the latest developments...

＠Mash
Ouch, all this sand in my eyes... Anyway, the message mentioned someone from the western lands...
[k]

＠Mash
Do you think there's something about his appearance that'll make it obvious it's him? Like, some sort of clothing that stands out?
[k]

？1：It mentioned a turban!
？2：Something like a black cape?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Yes. The region lies more to the south, but...
[k]

＠Mash
T.E. Lawrence, commonly known as Lawrence of Arabia, fits the description!

A weird face on a lion's body? Creepy! Too creepy! Almost as bad as those monsters on Kunlun!
[k]

＠Sanzang
And laser beams!? Why do laser beams shoot out of its eyes!?

＠Sanzang
Quit it, quit with the projectiles! I'm a Caster, you should be coming at me with your fists!
