＠Drake
...Well now,[sr]you certainly brought me some strange ones, Bombe.
[k]

＠Pirate
Yeah. But they've got their good points.
[k]

＠Pirate
Not only did they save our lives,[sr]but they're excited to meet their idol captain.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
Idol. I'm their idol? Really?
[k]

＠Pirate
Yeah. They've been saying how great you are,[sr]how Drake can blast away the Spanish Armada in an instant!
[k]

＠Pirate
That Drake's a giant over 3 meters tall who downs rum[sr]by the barrel. They're really excited!
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
Whaaat? What's up with that?[sr]I haven't committed such sins yet!

Me too. Who knew that[sr]THE Francis Drake was[line 3] (whispering)
[k]

？1：Who knew she was a woman!

？2：Yeah, who knew she was a beautiful lady!

You must be Francis Drake.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
My name is Mash Kyrielite.[sr]I'm part of the Chaldea Security Organization.
[k]

＠Mash
This is my Master[line 2][sr][%1].
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
Chaldea? What do the "stargazers" want with us?[sr]Are they here to sell us some new maps of constellations?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Wha-? This drunk actually knows her stuff![sr]Even the origins of Chaldea!
[k]

＠Drake
...Something feels really shallow about you, sir.
[k]

＠Drake
Cowardly, gutless, pessimistic... A good man,[sr]but a chicken. I hate people like you the most.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
...Perfect.[sr]Senpai, her analysis... I mean instinct, is perfect!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Shucks...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
Well, spare me the details. They're just a pain in the ass.[sr]So, what does Chaldea want with me anyway?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Right, we were sent to[sr]fix all the anomalies in this era.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
...Okay.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Captain Francis Drake.[sr]Since you're so great, you've probably already noticed.
[k]

＠Mash
Something is wrong with this era, with this world.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The ocean you've spent your days in,[sr]and the ocean we see before us, are not the same.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
...Heh, all this talk about the world, the era,[sr]they were things I decided to completely ignore...
[k]

＠Drake
...But I can't ignore talk about the ocean.[sr]You're right, something did feel strange.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
...I thought so![sr]We can explain why[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
[line 3]But when I say "strange," I don't mean it as a bad[sr]thing. There's no other world that's as fun as this one!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Drake
Isn't that right, you scumbags?
[k]

[se ad6]
[wt 1]
＠Pirate
Woo-hoo! You bet![sr]You're the best, Boss! Hear, hear, to never-ending rum!

Whaaaaaaaat?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
You see? We pirates long for freedom,[sr]even if it entails evil deeds!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
If you insist on speaking with me...[sr]You must pass some tests first.
[k]

＠Drake
Try to defeat me, THE Francis Drake.[sr]Then we can talk!

I'm as drunk as they come right now![sr]Let's see if you have what it takes to sober me up!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I guess too much freedom is sometimes a bad thing.[sr]Like in France, please use the back of the blade!
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
O-Of course![sr]I shall respond to Captain Drake's request. Master!
[k]

？1：Okay, let's do this!

？2：Let's go!
