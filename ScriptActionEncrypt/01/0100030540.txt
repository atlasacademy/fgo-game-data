...Eric Bloodaxe?[sr]How?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
W-We already defeated him, right!?[sr]We even verified he vanished[line 2]

A Servant summoning another Servant...[sr]Is that even possible? By BLACKBEARD!?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Perhaps he has a Holy Grail, or something similar in nature in his possession?
