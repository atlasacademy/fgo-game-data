Oh, so this is a dragon?[sr]It really looks like a lizard!
[k]

＠Mash
More precisely, a wyvern.[sr]We fought many during our battles in France.

Something the matter?

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
Oh no, I just thought of[sr]something...
[k]

？1：Use the dragons as materials.

？2：Fix the ship with the dragons.

？！

...That's it, Master!

...Oh, that's brilliant. If you process it,[sr]dragon scales are even harder than steel.

[charaFace F 4]
＠Euryale
We need someone really strong to process it,[sr]but...

Looks like it won't be a problem for Asterios.[sr]I'll try to strip their scales immediately!

Yeah, I feel reassured with this guy![sr]But don't overdo it like before!

Hey, let's eat first![sr]After that I'll let you meet our blacksmith!

Technical Director Leonardo. How many more[sr]wyverns do we need to slay to fix the ship?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Considering the size of the scale and how it shrinks while[sr]processing... I think 30 more wyverns should be enough.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
In that case, we should be able to do it[sr]in a day once we found a nest.
[k]

？1：Let's go hunting.

？2：Then it is a quest.

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
We make pretty good adventurers, right, Master?

＠Drake
Hmmm, maybe I should change the ship's name[sr]to the "Golden Dragon"...
