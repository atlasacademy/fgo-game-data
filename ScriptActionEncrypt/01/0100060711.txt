For a thief, you know pretty well when to quit. By the way, that accent... Are you a Muslim merchant?

＠???
Huh? I sure haven't heard that recently. Until a little while ago there were people like that everywhere.
[k]

＠???
There were quite a number of us around! We even did good business with the Crusaders.
[k]

＠???
But after the Holy City was built, the Lion King's aides crushed us in an instant.
[k]

＠???
I'm pretty quick-witted, though. I bowed down before them, and they let me live.
[k]

＠???
By the time I raised my head, everyone else had theirs chopped off! Isn't that just a laugh?

If you want me to talk, pay up! ...Or so I'd like to say, but you're all pretty scary, so I'm not making deals!

See you, weird [&guy:girl] and crew![sr]...But I was serious when I warned you to turn back.

＠E：Saruhan
This is for your own good. If you want to stay human, don't go near that castle.

＠Dr. Roman
Right. They were saying some disturbing things, but we have no choice but to jump into the lion's den.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Also, they were locals. I didn't detect any sort of Servant response.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Although they could be like Jekyll back in London, mixed in from a different era.

Hmm. They said they were merchants, but they might have been soldiers.

＠Da Vinci
Well, that's none of our concern. Anyway, let's hurry to the Holy City. Looks like something might happen soon.
