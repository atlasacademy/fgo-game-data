＠Dr. Roman
...And that's the current situation in Chaldea.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Currently, [%1] is the acting Master and in the middle of conducting field research.

＠Dr. Roman
Let me confirm something. You're a Servant from[sr]the Holy Grail War that broke out in this city, and the sole survivor?
[k]

[charaFace H 4]
＠Caster
If by that you mean I haven't lost. Our Holy Grail[sr]War changed to something else entirely along the way.
[k]

＠Caster
I don't know how it happened either. The city was engulfed in flames, and the humans vanished.[sr]Only the Servants remained.
[k]

＠Caster
Saber was the first to resume the Holy Grail War. That chap began rampaging like a tiger released from a cage.
[k]

＠Caster
Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker,[sr]and Assassin were all defeated by Saber.

The survival of the Seven Servants...[sr]That rule of the Holy Grail War was broken here.

＠Mash
And in the end you won, Caster...[sr]Or rather, you're the Servant who survived.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Caster
Yes. Any Servant that was defeated by Saber became like those two, corrupted by the black mud.
[k]

＠Caster
They, and the monsters that sprung up like maggots, started looking for something together.
[k]

＠Caster
The troublesome part is that I'm one of the things they're looking for. You see, the Holy Grail War won't end until I'm killed.

＠Dr. Roman
You and Saber are the only surviving Servants...[sr]Then if you defeat Saber...
[k]

＠Caster
Yes, that would probably end the Holy Grail War here.[sr]But I don't know whether things would return to normal.

＠Olga Marie
I see. You helped us, but in the end,[sr]it was for your own sake, huh?
[k]

＠Olga Marie
You want to defeat Saber, but don't stand a chance[sr]doing it alone. That's why you zeroed in on us... Right?
[k]

＠Caster
That's right. But it's not a bad deal, is it?[sr]At any rate[line 3]It looks like we've got company.
