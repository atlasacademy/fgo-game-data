Gasp! Awww, once I wake up,[sr]my harem is nothing but a distant dream.

＠Blackbeard
The only ones here are our teacher[sr]and the yuri couple in their own little world.

[charaFace F 3]
＠Blackbeard
...Well, I happen to like yuri myself.[sr]Since sleeping alone is so lonely (glance)

For someone with zero popularity,[sr]or rather, negative popularity, that's rich.

Actually, we didn't appear in your dreams, did we?[sr]If so, I'll just have to hit you with my gunstock till you forget.

Heh heh. So many heroines populate[sr]my dreams, I just don't remember.

Most likely. I have to say,[sr]they're out for revenge a lot earlier than expected.

Euryale-chan? What's this about my Euryale-chan?[sr]Bow! Is she at the bow?

If we don't get him now, Captain Drake and I[sr]have to fight that Servant in close combat.

＠Euryale
I know.[sr]But instead of hitting Blackbeard directly[line 2]
[k]

＠Euryale
It's better if I hit someone else.[sr]That's how my "arrow" works.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Euryale
Some of them are boarding[sr]our ship.
[k]

＠Euryale
There aren't many, so let's defeat them quickly.
