＠Pirate
Land ho, Boss!
[k]

＠Drake
All right, get us closer![sr]...So, what's your take, scholar man?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...This island's no good, either.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
No magical energy detected. We have several weak responses, but based on recorded data it's probably just monsters.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's a bust. On to the next.

[charaFace D 2]
＠Drake
You heard her! To starboard! Avoid that island!
[k]

＠Pirate
Aye, aye!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
...This island's also no good.[sr]That's three in a row.

I'm happy the charts are filling up,[sr]but nothing looks like a clue.

No Servants around, either.

[charaFace A 12]

...Even if there were, we probably wouldn't find someone[sr]who could put up a fight against Heracles...

[charaFace D 2]
＠Drake
All right, to the next island!

...You know, something still bugs me...[sr]About that Medea, I mean.
[k]

＠Mash
Medea... You mean the young girl[sr]standing next to Jason, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
She looked too sweet to be called[sr]the Witch of Colchis...
[k]

＠Orion
Yeah. If Medea transformed into a Servant,[sr]she'd definitely be her grown up self, right?
[k]

＠Orion
Medea was betrayed terribly by Jason,[sr]so she massacred his wife and children for revenge.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Orion
...No matter how you look at it, they should've[sr]started killing each other the moment she was summoned!

That's awful!
[k]

＠Artemis
At least Orion only flirts and randomly messes around with goddesses and other people's wives, right?
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Orion
Yeah, it's better to break those off clean...[sr]Pugyuru!?

Dammit, that was a loaded question!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Hmm. It could be that[sr]she's the young Medea.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Servants are summoned at the height of their powers,[sr]but this is before she became a witch...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In other words, when she was first learning Magecraft at[sr]Colchis Temple... Before she became "Jason's wife."
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That explains the way she looked and acted.[sr]She hasn't experienced Jason abandoning her yet.

I wonder if we should pity her...
[k]

＠Euryale
Impossible. Once you become a Heroic Spirit,[sr]a slight difference in age won't alter your memories.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Euryale
...I'm sure she knows the outcome of her story with[sr]Jason. So why does she act like that...

＠Drake
It's obvious she's "acting oblivious."[sr]It's a pity, but also horrifying.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
Unlike you, she's not someone who can look[sr]a person in the eye and pick a fight.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Euryale
What does that mean?[sr]I ignore humans because they don't matter to me, okay?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...I know this! What they call[sr]that cold attitude of hers...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That explains Blackbeard's obsession...[sr]She's obviously a tsun[line 3]
