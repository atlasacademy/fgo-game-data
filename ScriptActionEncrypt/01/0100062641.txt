...Now then, what were we talking about?

Hey you, enough with your remarks! You must think of it as the pharaoh's unique way of showing consideration!

？2：We were talking about joining forces, my king.

[charaFace B 3]
＠Ozymandias
I know that. I thought it'd be awkward to discuss it after the fight, so I was doing you a favor. Let it slide, alligator-brains.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

？！


＠Ozymandias
You've demonstrated your strength. As such, I mustn't treat you lightly, either.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Ozymandias
I'm no different from the Lion King if I only protect my own people, huh? Xuanzang Sanzang, it's as you say.

＠Ozymandias
I was so fixated on planning for the future that I chose the safest route. I was determined, but at the same time, narrow-minded.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Ozymandias
Hmph... Perhaps because I acquired this Grail without much thought, I was obsessed with things I normally would not care about.

Your reward. Take it. It was a satisfying fight worthy of it.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Ozymandias
But, this era is different from other Singularities. Humanity will not be restored just by obtaining the Holy Grail.

We're aware of it. Unless we can stop the Lion King's sacred lance, this era's disturbance will never disappear.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
King Ozymandias. You gave up your trump card, the Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Does that mean you will cooperate with our capture of the Holy City?

Don't make me say it out loud, lady of beauty. I have already told the guardian beasts outside to stand down.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Ozymandias
I'll lend you my Divine Beast Corps. I'd demonstrate my own strength on the battlefield as well, but...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Ozymandias
I'll likely have to attend to something else. You go capture the Holy City on your own.

You mean the army of sphinxes outside!? That's this nation's strongest unit!

Thank you, King Ozymandias! Although it's a shame you won't be joining us!

What did you say? King... Hassan?

＠Ozymandias
Are you referring to the swordsman that looks like the grim reaper? You came to my desert on his advice?

That's right. That skeleton told us to go to the desert. Only then would he take on Sir Gawain for us.

...I see. Seems like you've wasted your time, [%1].
[k]


？1：Hey, you said my name!

＠Ozymandias
Nitocris wouldn't stop blathering on about it, so it stuck in my mind.
[k]


？2：What do you mean, wasted my time?

[charaFace B 1]
＠Ozymandias
...Heh.

＠Ozymandias
The leader of the Old Men of the Mountain and the one I am cautious of as much as the Lion King.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Ozymandias
The reason I didn't wage all-out war on the Lion King wasn't merely to guard this grand temple.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
I expanded this desert and fought against the mountain people. It was just after that.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
I was sitting alone on this throne, plotting my next military strategy, when lightning shot up my spine.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Ozymandias
It was such a chill that I turned around, and standing there was that man... the first Old Man of the Mountain.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
He was long done with his mission, too. In a brilliant display of swordsmanship, he'd already decapitated me.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
I swung back with all my strength, of course, but by that time he'd melted back into the darkness.

Already decapitated... Oh! Senpai, it's that thing, remember!?

？2：How are you still alive?!

＠Ozymandias
I realize he's my enemy, but I can't help but to admire his god-like assassination.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
If the battle hadn't taken place in my temple, my head would be long gone.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Ozymandias
Since then, I could not even move on my own until the wound healed.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
When you came to my temple, the wound was about to heal.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Ozymandias
Hmph... If I'd known he was cooperating with you, I would've agreed to help from the start.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Ozymandias
That's what I meant. If you'd told me first, you wouldn't have had to fight me.

Like I said, don't make me say it out loud. That you never know until you try...

How much embarrassment do you think the king of all gods can take?
