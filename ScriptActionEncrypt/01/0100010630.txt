＠Marie Antoinette
Is something wrong, Jeanne?[sr]You seem defeated... Are you tired?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
Marie... No, I'm not tired.[sr]I am a Servant, after all.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Marie Antoinette
Perhaps you're saddened by the state France is in...[sr]I mean, are you disappointed?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
No, I'm not disappointed.[sr]Thank you for your concern, Marie.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
But... Seeing those familiar towns in flames is a bit hard to bear.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
Yes... For you, especially, this era is exactly like it was when you were alive.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
It's different than what I feel inside...[sr]Memories that are still going on.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Yes! Why don't we take this time to talk?[sr]Girls' night out!
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
...Excuse me?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Oh, is that strange? But both you and I were summoned in the bloom of our youth.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
You see? I'm in the middle of puberty, right?[sr]So I love talking about love and romance!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne
Ahaha... I appreciate the offer, but that's hard for me.[sr]I know of compassion, but not romance.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Marie Antoinette
But... You're missing out on life! It's not too late to start! Fall in love with someone, Jeanne!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Of course, if I get the chance.[sr]Have you fallen in love, Marie?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
Heheh, of course.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
I fell in love with a boy who proposed to me at age 7.[sr]I think it was my first love.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
And when I was 14, I fell in love with the king I married.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
14! That's kind of amazing.
[k]

＠Jeanne
When I was that age... I was working and playing in the fields with the other children.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
That sounds fun, too! I'm jealous.[sr]It must be such fun to be able to go wherever you want!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Yes, it was fun.[sr]What I lacked in romance, I made up for in friendship.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Did all the boys like you?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
Hmm, my hair was short then, so they treated me like one of the guys[line 2]

It's good to be a queen!

The honor is mine. Who would've thought that I get to talk to the famous Marie Antoinette.

It's good to be a Servant.

I'm just glad that this isn't a real Holy Grail War.[sr]Otherwise, we couldn't chat like this[line 2]
