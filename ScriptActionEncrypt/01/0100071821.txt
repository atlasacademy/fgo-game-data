Humph... Perhaps you really weren't all talk.

But you can't win. While we fought, the Grail was delivered to Mother.

＠Ushiwakamaru
...Why? I don't know.

＠Ushiwakamaru
The old me died in the sea of mud. What you see before you is a dead woman, stripped of her reason and turned into a being of pure instinct.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
The truth is, I always had this in me, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Ushiwakamaru
There was a black, inhuman part of me that hated the world of man, and wanted to kill more than anything.

A huge number of Laḫmu has appeared again...! So...so many! Uruk isn't in any state to handle this many!

...So it's begun, huh? I must go, then. I don't want to run out of things to kill.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Now, should I destroy Uruk while its people try to fortify its little walls, or play with the refugees trying to escape beyond the Northern Wall?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Either way, I'm abandoning this body. I have no interest in clinging to something so wounded.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Farewell, survivors of Chaldea. I commend your efforts in slaying me...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Ushiwakamaru
...Hollow victory though it is. Death no longer holds meaning for me.

...Let's head back to Uruk, Master! Even if we don't make it in time, we can't just stay here!
[k]

？1：No, let's head to the observation point first.
？2：Mash, first you need to calm down.

＠Dr. Roman
No, it's not your fault. Nobody could've predicted something like that would happen.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
More importantly, we need to do what [%1] said, and head for the observation point!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's an emergency, but that doesn't mean we can run around blindly! First we need to know what's going on!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
And we need to rest, if even only for a few minutes.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You've been fighting this whole time. I want to at least get these two some rest in a room with a roof.

Like the great lucha announcers say, you can't get in the ring on an empty stomach, yes!
