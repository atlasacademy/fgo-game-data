＠Mash
Sanzang, are you still awake?[sr]Everyone is asleep now...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Sanzang
Hm? I was just writing down what happened today before I go to bed.
[k]

＠Sanzang
How about [%1]?[sr]Is everyone asleep already?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes, they're all sound asleep. Even Doctor Roman left his staff in charge and is taking a nap.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
I see. Chaldea's work is tough.[sr]No, it's not just tough... it's incredible.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I mean, it's Chaldea's job to send [%1] and you back and forth through time, right?
[k]

＠Sanzang
Their Servant System efforts are equally incredible. Normally, Heroic Spirits don't appear like this, you know.
[k]

＠Sanzang
When someone in this world summons a Heroic Spirit, all they're doing is temporarily invoking phenomena related to that spirit.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Sanzang
For example, in my case they'd say:[sr]“I've summoned Sanzang! Now I'm smarter!”
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
A Singularity created by the likes of the Holy Grail may indeed contain Servants like Touta and me...
[k]

＠Sanzang
But summoning Heroic Spirits without space-time distortion and then using them as familiars is impossible normally.
[k]

＠Sanzang
So when I found out Chaldea was able to perform such a miracle... Well, you can imagine my surprise.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...I don't know much myself, but...
[k]

＠Mash
Right up until the issue of the Grand Order, it was actually failure after failure.
[k]

＠Mash
Chaldea only succeeded in summoning three Heroic Spirits... the second of which lent me their strength.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Sanzang
Hmmm. Whoever it was, they certainly have a good eye.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
I suppose that Heroic Spirit probably thought it'd be a waste not to.
[k]

＠Sanzang
After all, to us Heroic Spirits, being summoned as a Servant is a miracle in itself.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Really?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
Yes, really. As I said, Heroic Spirits are nothing more than “strength” to be harnessed.
[k]

＠Sanzang
We were never summoned as individual beings before. This is incredible.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Every Heroic Spirit who gets summoned as a Servant probably has the same thought: “This sort of miracle will never happen again.”
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Sanzang
That's why most of us follow our own path after being summoned.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Because this is like a second dream, a continuation that never should've happened. One we'll wake from if we're not careful.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
Some follow the principles they lived by in their previous lives. Some try to erase their own regret and disappointment.
[k]

＠Sanzang
In my opinion, neither path is evil. It's simply behavior based on one's alignment as a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Sanzang
However, I do feel it's a little bit cruel.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I mean, we're given the chance to live as individuals, albeit temporarily. But in the end, even then we're just guests.
[k]

＠Sanzang
We don't get to become residents of the era into which we're summoned. We will always be outsiders from a different time.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
That's not true... I never thought of you as outsiders...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Sanzang
Thank you. But don't worry. Feelings of alienation only come from within.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I do feel that you and [%1] totally rely on me!
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...Yes. I was very happy when you joined us.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
Right!? I know a thing or two about traveling, you know?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Ah, yes! Your journey to Tianzhu! A long, long adventure with your three companions: Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Wujing.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Um... Can I ask you something? There was one thing that bothered me when I was reading Journey to the West...
[k]

＠Mash
Sanzang, why would you go to such lengths to continue your journey?
[k]

＠Mash
Your legends don't really mention your motivation...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Sanzang
Why? To get the Buddhist scriptures, make a name for myself, retire, and live happily ever after in Leiyin Temple, of course!
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
...Just kidding, although it's partially true.
[k]

＠Sanzang
The thing is, I just don't know when to quit. I really don't. I can be reincarnated three or nine times and still won't learn my lesson.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Also, it was never a case of me just going, “I think I'll go to Tianzhu!” No, it was a vow: “I'll make it to Tianzhu no matter what.”
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Is that like the Bodhisattva's vow in Buddhism?[sr]One of the conditions required to reach nirvana?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
No, that's a little bit different.[sr]...You see, sometimes I can hear the Buddha's voice.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Once I do, there's nothing that can stop me.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I'm normally a cowardly, selfish crybaby... But when you hear the voice of the Buddha, what choice is there but to obey to the best of your ability?
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Sanzang
“Go to Tianzhu.” “Discipline Wukong.”[sr]“Get out of this Holy City.” “Go across the desert.”
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
Things like that. So this time, I walked across the desert.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Sanzang
Wukong once told me: “It's the voice of the Buddha, but not one from on high: it's from inside your heart.”
[k]

＠Sanzang
“You're the one who said every human can become a Buddha, after all.”
[k]

＠Sanzang
“So what you hear is your own voice.[sr]The voice of your future enlightened self.”
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
That silly disciple... He says something cool like that once in a while. Hmm, either way...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Sanzang
The point is, my actions cannot be explained by reason.[sr]I just do whatever I want, however I want, whenever I want.
[k]

＠Sanzang
It's more like... I just genuinely believe in what I feel is the right thing to do.
[k]

＠Sanzang
The same must be true for you too.[sr]As a high priestess, I can tell.
[k]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 6]
[wt 1.0]
[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...You may be right. It's not the first time I've heard that.
[k]

＠Mash
Captain Drake, an individual we spent some time with, said something similar: that I already have a wish.
[k]

＠Mash
...But also that I'm better off not realizing what it is.[sr]I'll know in the end, she said.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Sanzang
...I'm not sure what that means, but could it be something like this?
[k]

＠Sanzang
Those who realize what they live for after you give them a shove,
[k]

＠Sanzang
as opposed to those who only realize what they have lived for at the end?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
They're nice words, but that Drake sounds like the complete opposite to who we are. She must've been insanely materialistic!
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes, she was an amazing person. She saved the world by following her own greed.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Umm. Sanzang, you have joined our side, yes... But we never asked about your intentions.
[k]

＠Mash
Is the Lion King an enemy to you?
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Sanzang
Yeah about that... I don't dislike the Lion King. I'm actually not interested in fighting against the Holy City.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Or against King Ozymandias in the desert.
[k]

＠Sanzang
In the end, some annoying lady prevented me from meeting him, but...
[k]

＠Sanzang
I saw how that desert nation was run.[sr]It was under a strict dictatorship, but it was peaceful.
[k]

＠Sanzang
The Lion King and Ozymandias are the same.[sr]They both strive to protect the people of their nation.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Sanzang
I understand both sides' sense of justice, but... Actually, wait, no. That's not right.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Let me say that again: I understand both sides' wrongdoings. That's why I can't take a stance. But...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
But?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
But I have a dream now.[sr]As a Servant who was summoned.
[k]

＠Sanzang
As someone who ended up meeting you and a Master named [%1].
[k]


＠Sanzang
Mash. After bringing peace to this era, I want to go to Chaldea.
[k]

＠Sanzang
There, I want to mentor [%1]. Together we'll laugh, cry, and laugh some more.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Sanzang
Uh... the King of Mages, was it? My dream is for us to have an overwhelming victory over him.
[k]

＠Sanzang
That's the voice I hear coming from the bottom of my heart. That's what I want to do the most.
[k]


[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
Even if this life is temporary, that's what I desire.[sr]That's why I will fight... with you guys.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Sanzang...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...Yes. You definitely will. I am looking forward to that moment.

[k]

＠Sanzang
...I'm really glad I was summoned as on my way back from Tianzhu.
[k]

＠Sanzang
After all, I found a purpose that seems even more exciting than my journey there.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sanzang
Oh well. It'll take longer for me to become a Buddha now, but I'm sure the Lord Tathagata will let it go this time, right?
