...Master, I'm sensing the presence of a Servant.[sr]There's one...no, several hundred!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
It's the same presence from before. But I can[sr]only tell that one of them is an actual Servant.

Is this an ambush?[sr]Where did several hundred enemies come from?

＠F：???
It's not an ambush.[sr]I chose to defend this place, that's all.
[k]

＠F：???
You people trespassed into my stronghold.[sr]So I shall defend it.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠F：???
I will crush any and all enemies more valiantly than any attack, and far stronger than any defense.
[k]

＠F：???
This is how we Spartans fight.[sr]You will soon experience it for yourselves.

＠Leonidas
Servant, Lancer.[sr]My True Name is Leonidas.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He's not hiding his True Name. Just like last time,[sr]this is far different than a normal Holy Grail War.

＠Nero
Leonidas?[sr]You introduce yourself as King Leonidas of Sparta?
[k]

＠Leonidas
Precisely.[sr]It is an immoral war, but I'm still going to destroy you.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
What! You are the legendary Leonidas,[sr]the guardian of the Hot Gates!
[k]

＠Nero
So the "emperors" aren't the only ones who came back?[sr]Hmm, then what about Boudica?
[k]

？1：Stay focused on the battle!

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
U-Umu?
[k]

？2：We met Elisabeth, too, remember?

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
Ah, now that you mention it.[sr]Hmm, but then is Boudica...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Is she also dead?[sr]Is that it?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
Or was she alive? I told her, "This time, surrender[sr]yourself to Rome." Thinking that was the case...
[k]

？！

N-Never mind that Nero, there are many enemies.[sr]We must strengthen our defenses!

＠Nero
U-Umu, our unit is quite small.[sr]I hope we're able to defend...

[charaFadein A 0.1 2]
＠Mash
If we defeat the main Servant, the remaining hundreds[sr]should be gone. In that case[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
Master, it's a Servant battle.[sr]Your orders, please!
