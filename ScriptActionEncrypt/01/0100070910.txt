At this time, the majority of Demonic Beasts will be hungry. They'll attack any prey that comes within their line of sight.

I'm counting on you. If even one of them realizes the vanguard is a diversion, we won't be able to stop the pack's collective will.
[k]

＠Leonidas
We estimate there are more than two hundred of them on the outskirts of Nippur. Hopefully Lord Ushiwakamaru's force will be enough for the diversion.
[k]

＠Leonidas
...I would have liked one hundred more of you to fight in the plains, but I can't take away any more soldiers from the Northern Wall's defense.

Until the citizens of Nippur reach the Northern Wall[line 3]

Or rather, until they are far enough away from Nippur, please continue to distract the Demonic Beasts.

But, unlike humans, Demonic Beasts do not care about wounds or losses. If they do not retreat even when their pack is reduced by half,

I'm sure it will turn into a long battle. One that won't end until we kill the last one of them. And then there's my promise to King Gilgamesh.

＠Leonidas
Now then, allow me to go over the mission we outlined during last night's meeting.
[k]

＠Leonidas
There are over two hundred citizens left in Nippur.
[k]

＠Leonidas
The majority of them are those who could not be evacuated: the women, the elderly, and the wounded.
[k]

＠Leonidas
I'm sure they're afraid and won't try to leave Nippur unless their safety is guaranteed.
[k]

＠Leonidas
First, we will protect and escort the guide, a former citizen of Nippur, to the west gate and persuade the guards to open it.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Then, our soldiers will show the citizens the escape route and lead them on a westward course to the Northern Wall.
[k]

＠Leonidas
No matter how many of the Demonic Beasts that Ushiwakamaru and the others lure away, a handful of them will catch the citizens' scent.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Your job is to eliminate those Demonic Beasts. Are you with me so far?
[k]

？1：Of course!
？2：We'll do our best!

？！

However, take three deep breaths. You'll still be afraid, but your muscles will loosen up.

[charaFace F 0]
＠Leonidas
Now listen. Our messengers in Nippur were helping us maintain contact with the city, but we haven't heard from them in the past few days.
[k]

＠Leonidas
If you sense danger... No, let me rephrase. If you determine that it's too late, withdraw immediately.
[k]

＠Leonidas
I have a feeling you will be tasked with an even bigger mission after this.

＠Leonidas
Therefore, prioritize your own lives. That's all I have to say.

One should always strive to face danger. I beg your pardon, but that is the destiny of those who have survived up till now.

＠Leonidas
Am I wrong, Romani of Chaldea?
[k]

＠Leonidas
Even if one was incompetent in the beginning, a talent for magecraft isn't that important for traveling through the ages as a Master.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Because no matter how much of a genius one is, they are utterly powerless in the face of this cataclysm.
[k]

＠Leonidas
And so, what's most important in saving humanity is to not avert one's eyes from hardship. That's what I think.
