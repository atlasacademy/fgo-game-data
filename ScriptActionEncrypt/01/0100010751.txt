This reading is way beyond a Servant[line 2][sr]It's indicating an "ultra-size lifeform."

It's approaching with incredible speed!

If the reading is truly beyond that of a Servant, then we need the "Dragon Slayer" more than ever.

That person must be in this town, right?[sr]We can at least look for that Servant[line 2]

Don't worry yourself over me.[sr]If things get bad, I'll run away on my own!
