It's our one and only chance, Master!

There's a fissure in space about one kilometer up ahead! Beyond that must be the King of Mages' throne!

[line 3]Well, leaving that aside, Romani! The final battle is right before us, but let's confirm a few things.

The one who carried out the Incineration of Humanity, the one who waits at the temple as the Mage King Solomon...who exactly is that!?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Is he real or is he fake?[sr]Is he a Heroic Spirit or is he something else?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Whether it's true or false, as the commander, you should have an answer by now.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Don't you think that information is necessary for[sr][%1]?

＠Dr. Roman
Fine. It's only an assumption, but I'll tell you.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Although it's a bit embarrassing when you guys are about to fight the answer itself soon.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
That Solomon is not an imposter. When we made contact with this Temple of Time, that fact became undeniable.
[k]


[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Because what makes up this temple is Solomon's Magical Circuit itself.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
No one besides Solomon can control King Solomon's Magical Circuit.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Which means that the possibility of a third person using his name has been eliminated.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But that doesn't mean we can jump to the conclusion that he's “real.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's still the possibility of someone controlling him. Or else[line 3]
[k]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 7]
＠D：Mash
If King Solomon isn't the same person he was in life...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠D：Mash
...he may have become a different class, like Jeanne d'Arc or Cú Chulainn, correct?
[k]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Yeah, but even if Solomon became an Alter, I don't think it would change much.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If the opposite of good is evil, and evil is the opposite of good, Solomon is “nothing.” He would remain the same, no matter what.
[k]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 6]
＠D：Mash
...“Nothing”? Don't you mean “neutral”?
[k]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 8]
＠Dr. Roman
Nope, nothing. Because he never wished for anything. King Solomon was never allowed a will of his own.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He was a creature born to become king. He's different than King David who became a king after starting as a shepherd.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He was the child that the great King David offered to God to become an even greater king than him.
[k]

[charaFace B 10]
＠Dr. Roman
Solomon does not have the same mindset or life as a human. That kind of freedom[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace B 7]
＠Dr. Roman
Those human rights were not allowed, although he had more than enough divine and royal rights. King Solomon barely had any human feelings.

...And that's why you're saying he wouldn't be evil even as an Alter. But anybody can see that the King of Mages is pretty evil.
[k]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Yeah, that's what gets me.
[k]

[charaFace B 8]
＠Dr. Roman
“Maybe Solomon had a human-like concept of good and evil after all, and he gained evil motives after turning into a different class.”
[k]


＠Dr. Roman
That's what I thought...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
But that's not it. I'm certain of it after coming here.[sr]That thing is King Solomon, but the inside isn't.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's the same as Kingu. It means that thing is just King Solomon's corpse.

A corpse...!? Then when he said he resurrected himself...!?
[k]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 10]
＠Dr. Roman
Yeah. King Solomon literally meant he just raised the body back from the dead.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Later, to prepare for the Incineration of Humanity, he spread the seeds of the Demon God Pillars, his minions.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And then he created this Singularity and lived until the year 2018. Well, although this place doesn't really have a concept of time.
[k]

？1：Um, what is the “inside” then...?
？2：I knew it...

Yeah. We've been getting a taste of his true identity all along.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
What I don't understand is the reason.[sr]Why did he...no, “they” come up with such a purpose?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
That was the thing I just couldn't understand. That is why I've been silent up until now, but there's no need to worry anymore.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Because now we can ask him the answer in person. Okay, you're almost at the dimensional fissure.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
After you go through that, you'll be at the center of the temple[line 3] the throne of the man who was called the supreme king resides there.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
This will be the last transmission from Chaldea...[sr]No, our last conversation.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...That's why I'll ask you a question I could never ask you until now.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Mash. Do you have any regrets?[sr]Is this the outcome you really hoped for?

Your enemy is Solomon, the King of Mages[line 3] With all the strength you've built up until now, destroy this Singularity!
