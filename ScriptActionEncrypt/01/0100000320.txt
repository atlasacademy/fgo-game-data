＠Olga Marie
By the way, the type of being we call Servants, you know what they are, don't you?
[k]

？1：I have no idea.

＠Olga Marie
Just as I thought.[sr]It can't be helped. I'll tell you as we move.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Think of a Servant as the highest-ranked familiar in the magical world.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Various historical heroes. Noble acts. Concepts.[sr]They're all summoned as spiritual bodies.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Whether or not a hero truly existed, he or she is still "information that was produced on Earth," right?
[k]

＠Olga Marie
To summon a Heroic Spirit is to convert the information stored on this planet into something for the good of mankind.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
People today have the right to use legacies of the past, and with that right, the duty to leave behind a future.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Do you see? What you made your contract with is greater than a human, and yet is a tool to serve humans.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That's why they're called Servants. Even if they're[sr]gods, they exist only to serve their Masters.

＠Mash
Director. Your line of thinking may be extreme.[sr]My cells are not agreeing with what you just said.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Olga Marie
Hmph. Meaning the Servant you fused with must be an Earth-type Heroic Spirit.
[k]

？2：I do have some basic knowledge.

[charaFace E 2]
＠Olga Marie
Glad to hear it. Now I won't have to explain[sr]rudimentary things like what a Heroic Spirit is.
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 0]
＠Olga Marie
[FF0000]Servants[-] are heroes of the past made into familiars.[sr]Those who enter into a contract with them and use them are [FF0000]Masters[-].
[k]

＠Olga Marie
There are seven classes of Servants, which vary depending on a Servant's legends and abilities.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
It's incredibly difficult to copy a Heroic Spirit entirely.[sr]Human mages do not have enough resources or memory to achieve such feat.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That's why only one aspect of a Heroic Spirit is fixed in our world, resulting in the seven classes[line 3]
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Berserker, Assassin.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Every Heroic Spirit will manifest as one of these classes.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That's the true nature of Servants...[sr]It's also a way to hide their True Names, as well.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
They hide their names because they are famous.[sr]Take Achilles from Greek Mythology.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Achilles is an invincible Heroic Spirit, but his weakness is extremely famous, right?
[k]

＠Olga Marie
When a Heroic Spirit returns, their weakness returns with[sr]them. That's why Servants hide their names behind their class names.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
If you don't know their identity, it's harder to figure out their past or weaknesses, right?
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That's not all.[sr]There's another reason for hiding one's True Name.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
A Servant has a secret weapon worthy of their legend.[sr]The crystallization of that Heroic Spirit's miracle and existence.
