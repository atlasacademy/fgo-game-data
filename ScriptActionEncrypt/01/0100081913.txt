I've come to understand you.[sr]Can you not understand me?
[k]

＠Goetia
We both know how utterly meaningless life truly is.[sr]We mourn death's inevitable approach.
[k]

＠Goetia
...Isn't that right? The future is hollow.[sr]Humanity is worthless.
[k]

＠Goetia
Because, even alive, they must be in constant fear of death. No matter what, death always comes for them, and separates people from each other.
[k]

＠Goetia
I tire of it. A world without death should be exactly what someone like you wishes for.
[k]

＠Goetia
Though we are all now one, a measure of uncertainty yet remains...
[k]

＠Goetia
We want someone, just a single person, to understand us. If we have even that much, then we can be completely certain in our plan.
[k]

＠Goetia
Mash Kyrielight, a life made by man, and one that is about to disappear...
[k]

＠Goetia
Join with us in rejecting all of human history.[sr]Tell us that we are correct.

Just say one word: “Yes.” With your assent, we shall permit you to journey with us towards the apex.

I'm sure you're well aware, [%1], that her life has long since reached its limit.
[k]

＠Goetia
Honor thy neighbor. Believe in thy friend. Love thy comrade. If that is what human righteousness is, then do not interfere.
[k]

＠Goetia
Something within us is telling us not to leave her to die. To not let the last memories of this planet be of tragedy.
[k]

＠Goetia
Don't you feel the same? The Incineration of Humanity cannot be stopped. If you're going to die either way, shouldn't you at least save Mash?
[k]

？1：...Mash...
