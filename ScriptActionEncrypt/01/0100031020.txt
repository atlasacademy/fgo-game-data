＠Jason
You can't win! As if you could![sr]Heracles traveled everywhere, fought every monster.
[k]

＠Jason
He was undefeated, and ultimately rose to become[sr]a god!
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Jason
He's not like you second and third-raters.[sr]You trash mobs are fated to be ripped to shreds!
[k]

＠Jason
Of course, as a summoned Servant,[sr]he does lack two things.
[k]

＠Jason
Intelligence and dignity. He's just a vicious stray dog[sr]now. Serves him right, I'd say.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Jason
Now... Hand over Euryale.
[k]

＠Jason
...If you do, I'll stop[sr]sending Heracles to attack you.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Jason
What do you say, you Master-ish entity?
[k]

？1：I refuse.

？2：Shut up.

？！

＠Euryale
...
[k]

＠Mash
Master!
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Jason
Haha![sr]I see, I see!
[k]

＠Jason
You are very courageous![sr]I really, really, really like you!
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Jason
And you have such a cute Servant, too![sr]Good, very good! You're just like a hero!
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Jason
Wooo![sr]So cool!
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Jason
[line 2]Geez, so cocky for the likes of trash.[sr]Can you perish now, Servants and all?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Jason
Medea![sr]My beloved Medea!

＠Medea Lily
Yes. Are you calling me, Master?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Jason
You know what I want, right?[sr]I want you to kill them and break them into tiny pieces!
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Jason
Just like you did to your little brother![sr]Ah, it's fine, it's fine.
[k]

＠Jason
I already repented![sr]I will never betray you again!
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Medea Lily
Little brother, in pieces?[sr]Sometimes you say strange things, Master.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Medea Lily
But that's right, Lord Jason was like this.[sr]Now, you are like this.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
That's why details don't matter. I'm the first disciple[sr]of Hekate, goddess of Magecraft[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Medea Lily
Princess Medea will make your desires come true.
[k]

＠Artemis
Oh, I know this.[sr]It is called DV.
[k]

＠Orion
It's worse than DV.[sr]Neither of the two are looking at their partner!
[k]

＠Jason
And Heracles![sr]You shall go too! I'll be looking after you two from here.
[k]

＠Mash
...He sends his wife to the front line, but doesn't fight[sr]himself. Um, Master. Maybe he is...
[k]

？1：The scum of mankind.

？2：A trivial boss.

？！

[charaFace F 4]
＠Jason
Hah, that's a funny joke.[sr]...Kill them all, Heracles!
[k]

＠Orion
To think there's someone even scummier than me.[sr]This world is so big, and Greece is so tiny.
