＠Blavatsky
That's right. You can't really underestimate a Caster from the 19th century, can you?
[k]

＠Blavatsky
Well, since I've lived on this continent before, my affinity with this land is not so bad.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
Tell the guard if you're willing to cooperate. We'll let you out immediately.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Blavatsky
...Tell me, [%1].[sr]Why did you refuse?
[k]

＠Blavatsky
As the gentleman from Chaldea said,[sr]you could have just betrayed us along the way.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
At the very least, I'm sure you saw this coming.[sr]Yet you chose this foolish path.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
Why?
[k]

？1：For Edison's sake.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Blavatsky
...I see.[sr]True, I'm sure he'd be hurt if you'd betrayed him.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
In life, he was fed up by all the lawsuits.[sr]Despite the way he looks, he's naïve.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
He loves his country more than anyone and thinking that is only natural. No, he's obsessed. It's extreme self-righteous patriotism.

＠Blavatsky
For better or worse,[sr]only Mr. Edison can stop the Celtic army.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
That's why I'm with him for now.[sr]I do have obligations from when we were alive, too.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

...However, [%1],[sr]what you said makes me happy.

Please don't hate him too much. As the King of Inventions, he really is an amusing person, like a child.

You never abandon someone once you've become allies, huh?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Blavatsky
As a Master and a human being, that's wonderful.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
Though other people may think it's foolish...
[k]

＠Blavatsky
...your actions are noble, more so than anybody else.
[k]

？！

＠Blavatsky
[line 3]Rest easy.[sr]Someone will come to your rescue soon.

＠Blavatsky
Until then, just wait here.
