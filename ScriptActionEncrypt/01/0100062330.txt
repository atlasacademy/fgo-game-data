＠Holmes
Rejoice, everyone. We're nearly at the center.[sr]Many answers await us ahead.
[k]

＠Holmes
The Old Man of the Mountain sent you here for two reasons.
[k]

＠Holmes
The first relates to this Singularity: to gain knowledge about the Lion King's objectives and his sacred lance.
[k]

＠Holmes
The second relates to all seven Singularities. In other words, a part of the mystery behind the Incineration of Humanity.
[k]

＠Holmes
I'm prepared to answer both of those.[sr]However, before that...

＠Holmes
No. I have a warning.[sr]...Well, more like a declaration.
[k]

＠Holmes
The greatest reason why I appeared before you is that the peering eyes of Chaldea cannot reach you here.
[k]

＠Holmes
Let me tell you in advance.[sr]I do not trust Doctor Roman.
