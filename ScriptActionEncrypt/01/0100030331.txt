＠Dr. Roman
Wait, that's odd.[sr]He vanished, but there's still a Servant response...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
What's the matter?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Huh? It's gone.[sr]Hmm, since coming to this era, I've been off my game.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Sorry, the equipment's not in the best shape.[sr]It's going to be a little hard to track you.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There are no more Servants on that island,[sr]and those pirates from before are all gone.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
I see.[sr]Then how about we go on a treasure hunt?

Do you think there's treasure, Senpai?
[k]

？1：I do.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Really?[sr]...It would be interesting if there was one.
[k]

？2：I don't.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
If you consider it rationally, there shouldn't be.[sr]...Though it would be fun if there were.
[k]

？！

＠Drake
Hey! Over here![sr]I found something!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Huh? You did?[sr]Let's go, Master!

See this ship?[sr]It's probably the one that king was on.
[k]

＠Mash
Doctor, can you find out?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah, but I don't think there's any need.[sr]It's a larger version of the ships the Vikings used.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Therefore, it should look like something out of the 9th century...but it's good as new.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
It does not appear to be...a treasure.
[k]

＠Drake
Sure it is. You guys wait right here.[sr]If this is a Viking ship, I'm sure it has one[line 2]

[charaFace A 6]

...A book?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
When sailing, Vikings record everything from starting[sr]point to destination using pictures and glyphs.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Drake
Coast shapes, shoal spots, current traits, and paths[line 2]
[k]

＠Drake
If they appeared here out of the blue that's one thing,[sr]but if they sailed here...

Yes, I smell fresh ink! This must be the[sr]chart for this island and it's surroundings.
[k]

＠Drake
There's no better treasure for us since we're about[sr]to set sail into the seas, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...You have a good point. Captain Drake, well...[sr]You seem violent, but you're actually pretty pragmatic.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
Impressed?[sr]Now, how about that trip around the world?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Umm...
[k]

？1：I'll think about it.

？2：After this battle is over.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
I see, I see! With you guys, our strength would be a[sr]hundredfold! We'll depart after restocking food and water.
[k]

＠Drake
Now, time to return to the ship!

...Senpai, are you sure about this?[sr]By correcting this era, the memories of us[line 2]
[k]

？1：Not a problem.

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
...As her memories disappear,[sr]I suppose the problem itself will be gone, but...
[k]

？2：I forgot about that.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Wait, Senpai... Were you really planning on[sr]sailing around the world?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

...Oh, please stop teasing me!

Now, according to the Viking map[line 2][sr]there's an island to the northwest.
[k]

＠Drake
Considering our speed, it'll take about 10 hours.[sr]If we can catch wind, maybe even less.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
We can have the glyphs analyzed.[sr]Doctor, I'm transferring the data.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Very well. One book shouldn't be an issue over here.[sr]That said, I'd like a summoning point established soon.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Let's hope there's a Leyline on the next island.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
All right, you scallywags! Time to set sail!
