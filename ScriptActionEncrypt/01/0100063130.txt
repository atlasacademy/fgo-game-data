...It's time. I've detected a powerful magical response up ahead.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This is the highest point in the Holy City. It must be the location of the throne.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Just who and what is the Lion King? Why did the Sixth Singularity end up like this?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The answer to all of that lies beyond these doors. ...Are you ready, [%1]?

？1：...Let's go to the throne of the Lion King!

Why did you come to my castle? Why do you show yourselves before me?

＠Lion King
I am the Lion King. The King of the Storm and the Lord residing over the Ends of the World. The remnant of the hero who wields the sacred lance Rhongomyniad.

Makes no difference. To correct the course of humanity is the same as taking my life.

＠Lion King
You are here to kill me. Unfortunately, you are not chosen by the sacred lance.
[k]

＠Lion King
Your soul knows good but commits evil. While it is good, it allows evil.
[k]

＠Lion King
That is the same as evil. I had some expectations for the latest human who could reach my feet, however...
[k]

＠Lion King
You shall die here. Your soul is not needed in my utopia.

Humanity will be incinerated and history will become nothingness. But that goes against my purpose.

We were born thanks to you humans. A god cannot exist without humans.

Which is why you humans must remain. I will protect you no matter the cost.

I've decided to grant humans eternity. To souls worthy of remaining in the next world...
[k]

＠Lion King
Those who do no evil nor will they know evil even when affected by it. Those who know no end to goodness and yet are not aware of their goodness.
[k]

＠Lion King
I shall gather those purest souls, freeze them, and archive them.
[k]

＠Lion King
No matter how much time passes, I will store them in my lance as something whose value will never change.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

What is wrong with that? My work is all for you, humans.

You've answered the question. If you are to deny me, I will deny you, as well.
