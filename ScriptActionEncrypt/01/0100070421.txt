＠Uruk Civilian
Hey, I owe you one! I was helpless against those vermin!
[k]

＠Uruk Civilian
I only expected you to keep watch as I was shearing, but I never imagined you'd exterminate them...
[k]

＠Uruk Civilian
I expect nothing less from the elites working directly for the king! Help me again sometime! Here's three Sheep Silver.
[k]

＠Uruk Civilian
Huh? Don't I have sheep to shear, you ask?[sr]Well, the circumstances have changed...
[k]

＠Uruk Civilian
The girls from the Sacred Temple wanted to try shearing so much so that they're willing to pay me silver for it. So the other sheep were reserved for them.
[k]

＠Uruk Civilian
Who knew that shearing sheep would become a business unto itself... Oh brother, fads sure are weird...

Well, that didn't go the way they'd hoped...[sr]I have nothing to say to Mash and Ana...

＠Dr. Roman
Must be a side effect of the sudden introduction of a monetary system and the ability to “buy” entertainment.

＠Dr. Roman
It is an effective method of livening up a city, but it might be about 500 years too early...

＠Mash
Yes... I believe security deposits of silver began thriving from around the Akkadian period. They didn't exist in the Early Dynastic period...
[k]

＠Mash
It's not that King Gilgamesh is at fault, but perhaps it was too early for the citizens of Uruk...

I agree, Mash. The monetary system is bad civilization... Reservations are terrible...
