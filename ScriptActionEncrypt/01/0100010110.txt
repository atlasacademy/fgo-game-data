...Sigh.[sr]We managed to reach here safely, Senpai.

＠Mash
We were teleported by accident last time. This time it's[sr]a proper teleport via the Coffin with no physical anomalies.

Fou?[sr]Did you tag along again?
[k]

Fou...[sr]kyuu, kyao...
[k]

？1：Can Fou Rayshift too?

？2：Did he sneak into Mash's Coffin?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Seems that way.[sr]He must have sneaked into mine or Senpai's Coffin.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Luckily, Fou was unharmed.
[k]

＠Mash
Since he is attached to one of us, when we return he will automatically return as well.
[k]

？1：In that case, no problem, right?

？2：I need to get back safely for Fou's sake, too.

？！

[charaFace A 13]

Yes. We share the same fate.

[line 2]Master. I have confirmed the time axis coordinates.[sr]Looks like it's the year 1431.
[k]

＠Mash
It means we're in the middle of the Hundred Years' War.[sr]But this should be during the war's respite period.
[k]

？1：Respite?

？2：Wars get time-offs?

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Right, The Hundred Years' War did not fight for the full 100 years as the name implies.
[k]

＠Mash
The war during this era was pretty carefree, relatively speaking.

Captured knights were released for monetary payments almost every day... Senpai?

A ring of light... No, some form of magecraft[sr]cast over the satellite orbit?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In any case it's gigantic.[sr]At worst, it's as big as North America?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Hmmm, no records show such phenomena occurring in 1431.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's surely one of the reasons for the disappearance of[sr]our future. We'll have to analyze it on our end...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You guys concentrate on surveying onsite.[sr]Start by searching for leylines.
[k]

＠Mash
What the Doctor said.
[k]

＠Mash
Explore the area, make contact with the people of this era, set up the summoning circle, there are many things to do.
[k]

＠Mash
We have to knock them out one at a time.[sr]Let's first move towards a city, Senpai.
