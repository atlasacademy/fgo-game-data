＠
I was omnipotent, but not because Solomon made me that way.
[k]

＠
We were born from the distortions in people's hearts, a colony comprised of many demon gods, each granted titles and abilities.
[k]

＠
I was transcendent from the beginning. The moment we were born, we were given omnipotence, and the benefit of its perspective.
[k]

＠Demon God Pillar
[D72727]Botis, Bathim, Sallos, Purson.[-][sr][D72727]Marax, Ipos, Aim, Naberius. Release.[-]
[k]

＠
The only complaint I had was that the 72 Demon God Pillars fused together, and were made to serve a single human:
[k]

＠
Solomon. A ruthless king. An incompetent king. A king who knew everything, yet used that knowledge to save no one.
[k]

＠
A man who seemed so easy-going... someone completely without worry, compared to how we would shake with anger. However...
[k]

＠
“To put it simply, I just didn't have the freedom to get mad.”
[k]

＠Demon God Pillar
[D72727]Orias, Vapula, Zagan, Valac, Andras.[-][sr][D72727]Andrealphus, Cimeies, Amdusias. Release.[-]
[k]

＠
...Ah, we are... coming apart...
[k]

＠
Since our birth, I have known true omnipotence, have never lacked for anything. To lose that, to feel it fading away... We cannot begin to describe this pain...
[k]

＠
My power is breaking apart so quickly... I am fading.[sr]Our entire existence is winking out...
[k]

＠
I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared.[sr]Disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting.
[k]

＠
As more and more pieces of me fade away, this... this horrible pain is robbing me of my hands, my feet...
[k]

＠Demon God Pillar
[D72727]Furfur, Marchosias, Stolas, Halphas.[-][sr][D72727]Malphas, Focalor, Vepar[line 3]All have faded away.[-]
[k]

＠
I don't know.
[k]

＠
We know neither the fear that drives one to scream for help, nor the reason one is compelled to cry out in protest of something being taken away.
[k]

＠
I do not know this regret, this frustration, this pathetic helplessness...
[k]

＠
I cannot bear it. We cannot bear it at all.[sr]...That is what makes it so terrifying.
[k]

＠
Even knowing all of this, that wretched king once again overcame this fear.
[k]

＠
To give up his omnipotence... a fate worse than death, once more.
[k]

＠
...Who believes he is an incompetent king?[sr]...Who feels he is ruthless?
[k]

＠Demon God Pillar
[D72727]Glasya-Labolas, Buné, Ronové, Berith, Astaroth.[-][sr][D72727]Forneus, Foras, Asmoday[line 3]Union refused.[-]
[k]

＠
My body is crumbling away... The Demon God Pillars are all choosing to disappear...
[k]

＠
We cannot maintain the union. Aggravating.[sr]The Heroic Spirits' rebellion has not stopped.
[k]

＠
I do not understand. How foolish.[sr]The one called “the Master” still lives.
[k]

＠
We cannot maintain the band of light. Only five more minutes... I only need five more minutes to complete our task.
[k]

＠
So then why...
[k]


＠
Why is [%1] standing before me!?
