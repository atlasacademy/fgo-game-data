＠D：???
All right, it's delivered.
[k]

＠E：???
...Whew. They're sure to notice the letter on that arrow.[sr]It's not like they have any clues right now.
[k]

＠E：???
Now they've got to come to this island... They should.[sr]But there is an off chance... Or not?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠E：???
Oh no, I'm getting anxious. If they don't figure out[sr]that arrow, we'll never get another chance!

＠E：???
It's about time the Argonauts found us as well.[sr]...And if things don't play out, it's checkmate.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠E：???
...This is bad. It's super bad.[sr]I'm getting horribly anxious. I need some medicine.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠D：???
Shut up.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠D：???
They have no will to fight? Impossible.[sr]We've already confirmed[line 2]They're determined to fight.
[k]

＠D：???
We're sure they're seeking the "Ark," right?[sr]Otherwise, they wouldn't be going island-hopping.
[k]

＠D：???
They'll surely come.[sr]The world will be destroyed if they don't.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠E：???
Of course my calculations are correct.[sr]Oh, but... No, I just can't.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠E：???
I can't stand the anxiety, the feeling that everything is futile!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠E：???
I know, my love...[sr]May I hold your hand?
[k]

＠E：???
I'd like your soft hand[sr]to guide me to tranquility. Desperately.
[k]

＠D：???
May you?[sr]You may not. So no.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠E：???
...I'd like an explanation[sr]as to why I may not, but...

Oh, Darling. Virginity? You're embarrassing me.

Oh, but I do run simulations every day[sr]of the day I lose my virginity, you see?

＠Orion
What's that now?
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Artemis
Um, um.[sr]Orion first slams his hand against the wall. Like, SLAM.

And then he whispers in my ear, "Am I not good enough?" In a husky voice! And then, and then[line 2]
