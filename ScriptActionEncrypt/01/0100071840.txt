They're not responding to us... They must have dull senses right when they come out of the water.

＠Ishtar
They're only capable of carrying out simple orders, like “go to the surface,” or “kill the old humans.”

＠Quetzalcoatl
But that's just for now. As time passes, their consciousness will synchronize with the others and they'll be like the ones we saw at Eridu.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Sheesh... They finally grow up and gain individuality, but then they go back to a colony. All our efforts were for nothing.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Those things aren't the new humanity. They're just soulless tools. In the name of the goddess, me, I will destroy them all, yes!
