Scáthach said she could never defeat Cú Chulainn, but I didn't believe her.

I felt nobody could ever defeat Scáthach.[sr]So[line 3]there was a part of me that wasn't worried.

A part of me that thought, even if we failed here, Scáthach would set it right.

A clash of Gáe Bolgs, unimaginable during our lifetimes.

Both claim to deliver fatal blows,[sr]while at the same time evading them.

With different Noble Phantasms, this would've ended in death, not a draw. But both our Noble Phantasms are forbidden magical spears.

Both thorns of death trace identical paths and clash.[sr]A curious phenomenon[line 2] one that may never occur again.

＠Scáthach
...But my, that right arm of yours. Have you been repairing it with rune spells as you throw your spear?

...Pretty much.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Scáthach
You're not waiting until the destruction ends to begin regenerating, unlike me.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Scáthach
You're regenerating while it is being destroyed. The pain must be excruciating... No, I am sure “excruciating” is not even enough to describe it.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Pain can be managed.[sr]I'm already prepared for the worst.

[line 2]Hmph, you've been enduring it well too, my mentor.

Not really.[sr]...In the end, I'm merely buying time.

[charaFace B 4]

“I should've died before things became this way,” I thought. If I regret anything about my life, that would be it.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Scáthach
[line 2]But, I have no desire to be killed by your current self. Personally, I preferred your previous self.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
I'm not obligated to shoulder any of the burden you bear. My path is simple and straightforward.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
I can't afford to be taking detours,[sr]nor can I afford to carry someone else's baggage.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
I'll take the shortest path to be king, and to rule.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Scáthach
[line 2]For whom?[sr]Is it for Medb?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Scáthach
Medb wished upon the Holy Grail, and made you into a king. But that was never your wish.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
What makes you think so? Do you really think I've never dreamed of becoming king?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Scáthach
You never mentioned such a dream when you were alive.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
True. Just as you say[line 2]in life,[sr]the thought of becoming king never crossed my mind.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
However. Isn't it common for Servants to harbor new dreams that might not have existed when they were alive?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Scáthach
...So, it's the opposite. You're trying to become a king as a result of becoming king.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Scáthach
[line 2]What a foolish contradiction. Despite becoming king, nothing indicated you became one.
[k]

＠Scáthach
That's why you have to destroy everything.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Scáthach
If a man stands alone in the deserted wilderness,[sr]then indeed, he must be the unopposed king.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Yeah, that's fine by me. That solution feels best.[sr]A hero's existence is full of contradictions, after all.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
It's not for Medb.[sr]I brandish this spear for my own self-interest.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...Now, you must be running out of ways to stall for time. Let's put an end to this, Scáthach.
