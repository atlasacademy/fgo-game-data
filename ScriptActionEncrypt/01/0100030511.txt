[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
Oh, don't be like that!
[k]

＠Euryale
Fine.[sr]But it's not something you get to hear often.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Euryale
Be grateful, and listen to the music of a goddess.

Euryale, I have a question.[sr]Why are people chasing after you?
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Euryale
You sure know how to open up old wounds.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...I'm sorry.[sr]But I thought it was something I should still ask.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Euryale
...Hmmm.[sr]Since you don't mean ill, I'll forgive you.
[k]

＠Euryale
...See. I'm cute, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
...Huh?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Euryale
I said, I'm cute, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
Erm... Well... Yes.
[k]

＠Euryale
You think so too, right?
[k]

？1：You're cute.

？2：You're beautiful.

？！

[charaFace F 4]
＠Euryale
Yes, I'm pretty and cute.[sr]That's why guys always want me...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Euryale
But this time, the most atrocious pervert is after me.[sr]A strange pirate, just like Drake.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
A pirate?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Euryale
Not just an ordinary pirate.[sr]A "Pirate Servant" is after me.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
!!!
[k]

＠Euryale
I don't know his True Name.[sr]But, he's certainly the most disgusting guy in the world.
[k]

＠Euryale
Even Scylla would feel pretty in front of him.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
...Not strong, not scary, but disgusting...[sr]What kind of pirate is he?
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Euryale
More importantly... Asterios,[sr]are your wounds better now?

[charaFace F 1]
＠Euryale
Oh, I see.[sr]Then you'll be all right carrying me on your shoulders?
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Asterios
Mhm...
