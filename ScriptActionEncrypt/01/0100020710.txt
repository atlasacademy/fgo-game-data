＠United Empire Soldier
I have a report, Your Majesty. Enemy attacks are[sr]intensifying[line 2]and we have a message from the front.
[k]

＠United Empire Soldier
A small unit led by the pretender, Emperor Nero, is advancing with incredible force.
[k]

＠United Empire Soldier
It's as you said, Your Majesty.[sr]There's a "special" enemy leader among them.

I see.

＠United Empire Soldier
Yes, sir.
[k]

＠Caesar
Hmm.
[k]

＠United Empire Soldier
Sir, how should we proceed?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caesar
Do nothing.[sr]Forget about them.
[k]

＠United Empire Soldier
What?
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Caesar
Only a Servant can stand up to another Servant.[sr]Seriously, it's such a pain.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Caesar
It's laughable to think that the fickle gods would come[sr]this far. I mean, look at me[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caesar
A "Saber" class, huh?[sr]To think they would make me take up my sword.
[k]

＠United Empire Soldier
D-Do you mean...[sr]Emperor Caesar, are you going into battle yourself?
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Caesar
Fool.
[k]

＠United Empire Soldier
Sir!
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caesar
I am not going into battle.[sr]They are coming to me.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Caesar
I'm not moving.[sr]The rest of you better not meddle with them, either.
[k]

＠United Empire Soldier
B-But, Your Majesty![sr]We are soldiers of the true United Roman Empire!
[k]

＠United Empire Soldier
If our rule over Gaul is the will of the gods, then we must not retreat!
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Caesar
Fool! Are you in a hurry to die? Humans cannot[sr]defeat a Servant. They would be slaughtered.
[k]

＠United Empire Soldier
B-But...
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Caesar
Then let it be an order.[sr]Fight in moderation, I do not desire your deaths.
[k]

＠United Empire Soldier
...Yes, sir![sr]With everything I have.

Honestly...[sr]I've had it with "that one's" whims.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Caesar
Perfect government. Perfect leadership. But then[sr]you're left with a colony of people without a will.

Hahahahaha. Wonderful. Everything is here.[sr]Hundreds, thousands of oppressor's evil agents are here.

＠Spartacus
Now is the time to sing of our victory. We're not at a disadvantage, we have the upper hand.[sr]From now on, my warcry shall signify the beginning of our triumph.

Not over there, here![sr]Oh, come on Spartacus!
