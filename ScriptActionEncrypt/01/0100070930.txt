I didn't mention this before, but I'm immortal.[sr]After all, I'm half-incubus.

The second this body is smashed, I will reappear in the world of dreams!

＠Merlin
But I'll need some time to return, so let's decide on a place to meet! How about the king's[line 3]

Immortal due to powerlessness?[sr]In that case, it's been a while, but I'll use my eyes.

I've collected enough human statues, but a statue of a half-incubus might look good in my temple.

You humans will be sacrificed. My Thousand Mystic Eyes will turn the fortress and everything around it into ash!
