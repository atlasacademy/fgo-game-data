No, maybe that's right. After all, they're both goddesses that rule Venus.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Ishtar is the goddess of the morning star, Venus.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And Quetzalcoatl is often depicted as the god of destruction Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, who is the personification of the morning star in Aztec myth.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In other words, they're both related to Venus.
[k]

Maybe the reason Quetzalcoatl is a goddess this time is that her aspect as Venus, that is, beauty, has been emphasized.

＠Dr. Roman
Jaguar Warrior is a Divine Spirit who was worshipped by Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Olmecs and the Aztecs.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
The jaguar is a symbol of battle and death. Jaguar Warrior is said to be related to one aspect of Tezcatlipoca,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
one of the highest deities that frequently appears in Mesoamerican mythology...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And this Tezcatlipoca is a rival to Quetzalcoatl.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Quetzalcoatl is the epitome of good, whereas Tezcatlipoca is the epitome of evil.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
In the myths, Quetzalcoatl is even killed by Tezcatlipoca.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This resulted in the fall of the civilization that Quetzalcoatl had lovingly raised.
