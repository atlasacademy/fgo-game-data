(Yawn) Good morning, all. I see you're ready for the next assignment.
[k]

＠Merlin
We still have time before Siduri arrives. So, what is for breakfast?

Um... So, what can we, uh, do for you this morning?

For Your Majesty to visit our humble barracks is quite unusual...

Heh. I figured I should mix things up. And I'm sure you've gotten tired of listening to Siduri's messages.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
As such, I'm going to personally give you your assignment this time. Nothing rough. Simply look into our water supply.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
The wagon is ready. You're going to head south of Uruk, towards the Persian Gulf.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
An observatory has been constructed there. There are ten days' worth of jars, made to automatically gather seawater.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
You will deliver the empty jars that are in the wagon and bring back the jars there that are filled with seawater.

＠Gilgamesh
It's easy indeed. Especially since the route to the Persian Gulf is the only area that hasn't been attacked by any of the three goddesses.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
You can carry out this duty without fear or worry. Know that you have my support.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Oh, Merlin and Ana aren't going with you this time. I only had two travel permits going to the Persian Gulf left over.

Such fine clouds by the Zagros Mountains. Here's a bit of wisdom: “Far-off sea of clouds. 'Round atop the white peak hill. Mountain of cedar.”
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Gilgamesh
Hmm, that didn't sound quite the way I imagined...[sr]I guess playing mages isn't my forte...
[k]

？1：King Gilgamesh, why the honor?

[charaFace C 1]
＠Gilgamesh
No need to be so stiff. Sometimes I want to just look at the sea, nothing more.
[k]

？2：Did you have some time to waste?

[charaFace C 2]
＠Gilgamesh
Fool! What makes you think I'd have any? Or even time to have fun! Precisely the reason I need to go on a trip like this!

Just so you know, I'm not doing this because I'm exhausted from my duties.

I'm definitely not doing it because I crave excitement.

(Sigh) Good grief. King Gilgamesh, I apologize for interrupting your jovial mood.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We're picking up some powerful magical energy signatures ahead. It seems you've got trouble, which I believe is what you wanted.

＠Gilgamesh
I see. They are merely some abandoned colossi. Perfect for a warm-up.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
It's too much trouble to stop the wagon. Show me how you destroy your enemies, [%1].
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Of course, if absolutely necessary, I suppose I could give you a hand.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
As you can see, they all seem to be Assassin-class stone statues. There should be no need to mention who has the upper hand here.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Heh. Again, I'll help if absolutely necessary. Only if you insist!
