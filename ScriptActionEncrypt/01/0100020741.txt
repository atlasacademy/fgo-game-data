Mm, mmm...[sr]Did we...get him?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yes, I can detect his readings are getting weaker.[sr]You've won. Congratulations.

Your sword was very powerful, but as long as I have Senpai's instructions I can block it.

Hmm, being taken out by beautiful women isn't so bad.

It's not feasible for me to act like a mere soldier anyway.[sr]Seriously, I was helpless against that person's weirdness.

＠Caesar
That's right, the true emperor of this era. That person[sr]is surely waiting for your arrival in the capital.
[k]

＠Caesar
I'm not an emperor to be exact, but none of the[sr]past "emperors" can stand up against that person.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Caesar
When you see that person's name and face,[sr]I wonder how you'll react? I can't wait.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caesar
I am not being sarcastic. You are beautiful,[sr]no matter what expression you may have[line 2]

He's gone...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
What's this...[sr]Is this some sort of magecraft...or...
[k]

？1：It's a Servant death.

[charaFace D 5]

What did you...

？！

＠Mash
A Servant disappears when facing death.[sr]Their temporary body dissipates, and their experience is sent back to the Throne.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
I don't quite understand...[sr]What that bastard, no, "that man" said earlier.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He is a Servant.[sr]A deceased human transcended into a different form.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
...I see.
[k]

＠Nero
I made you personally kill the once great ruler Caesar.

Nero[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
No, nothing. Umu![sr]I commend you for defeating one of the "emperors."
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
Now Gaul is truly under my command.[sr]We have shown the United Empire what we can do!
[k]

＠Nero
Just as I wished, just as my people wished, the Rome[sr]blessed by our ancestors and gods is returning to us!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
I will bring Rome back into my hands! Until then[line 2][sr]Until then, no matter what, I cannot afford to stop here.

...So Caesar was defeated.

[charaFadein G 0.4 1]
＠Lev
Yes, it seems that way.[sr]I only used him because he had a wish for the Grail.
[k]

＠Lev
This shouldn't cause many issues.[sr]I can summon as many new Servants as I want.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Lev
If there's an issue, it's this foolish Berserker.[sr]Isn't it obvious that Berserkers are fools?
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Lev
I was surprised he would defy my orders.[sr]Is blood thicker than water? What a joke.

Beautiful child...[sr]Nero, you will be loved, loved, so loved...

Therefore...[sr]In my destiny...

＠Lev
Hmph, I regret not having a Command Spell.[sr]However, I have quite the spell ready for you.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Lev
You will kill your niece with your own hands. Then,[sr]drowned in regret, you will destroy everything else in this era.
[k]

＠Lev
That said[line 3][sr]You likely don't have enough intellect left to regret.
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠Lev
My, my, Servants truly are inconvenient beings.
[k]

＠Lev
No matter how legendary you are, or how much superhuman strength you possess, in the end you are just mere familiars.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Lev
With the power to change the world at will, yet that freedom is not allowed. Talk about irony.
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠Lev
Say, wouldn't you agree?
[k]

＠E：???
...Well then.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Lev
Oh, excuse me.[sr]Come to think it, you are a Servant too.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Lev
[line 3]Heh, that's why you must obey me.[sr]If anything called destiny exists for you, I am it.
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠Lev
The utter annihilation of this era. The death of Emperor[sr]Nero, the collapse of ancient Rome, the death of humanity. 
[k]

＠Lev
That[line 2][sr]is my duty, bestowed upon me by our king.
[k]

＠E：???
...Yes.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Lev
Then, it is time to replenish our lost personnel.[sr]The summoning ritual is almost finished.
[k]

＠Lev
This is different than the incomplete one in Chaldea.[sr]I can truly summon Servants at will.
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠Lev
We were created as such. With this summoning ritual,[sr]I stand at the end of this world.
