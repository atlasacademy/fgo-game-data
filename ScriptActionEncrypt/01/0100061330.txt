＠???
(Sniff, hic) That was scary... So scary...
[k]

＠???
Why is it... always when you're at your weakest... that they all come at you... Like BAM!?
[k]

＠???
I didn't do anything at all... Ah, well, I guess I was hogging the watering hole, yes...
[k]

＠???
But even then, I at least left enough for the wild animals... (Sniff, sniff)

(Sob, sob) Sheesh... Why do I always get into these situations...
[k]

＠???
I materialize here all alone... I can't hear the Bodhisattva's voice anymore... (Sniff)
[k]

＠???
Turning into Spirit Form feels kinda gross, so I don't wanna... (hic)
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠???
Ugh... And it's all because... Oh! If only I didn't give Wukong and the boys time off!
[k]

＠???
But what else was I supposed to do!? Those idiot disciples were so unbelievably helpless!
[k]

＠???
Wujing's still single at that age! Go back to the Heavenly Realm already and find yourself a wife!
[k]

＠???
Then to think Bajie was actually married once!
[k]

＠???
That he had a wife and kids... You sure can't judge a pig [charaFace E 0]by its cover! Haha, nice one!
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠???
But I can't forgive him for leaving his wife all alone. Hence, he is excommunicated until he apologizes to her!
[k]

＠???
And that Wukong! Back on Flowers and Fruit Mountain, he can have his pick! What's he doing hanging around me!?
[k]

＠???
Hurry back to your mountain so that everyone can feel safe! Me? I'm perfectly fine alone!
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠???
I'm going to become a Buddha![sr]I can worry about falling in love AFTER that!

Huh? That's the Servant you've been talking about!?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Yes, she's definitely a Servant. Considering her aura and her magical energy, there's no doubt about it.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Nonsense... Are you saying that despite her top-level Spirit Origin, she was screaming from an animal attack!?

What? No! Could that dragon be...!?

[charaFace E 2]
＠???
I didn't have any food, so I figured I'd ask the White Dragon Horse for help. But when I tried to summon him I failed.
[k]

＠???
So I told him, “Sorry, I can't send you home. Just give up.” But then he got angry and attacked me!
[k]

＠???
Maybe a demonic dragon that's making people suffer in France!?
