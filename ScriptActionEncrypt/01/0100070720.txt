＠Testimony: Rancher A
What did the goddess Ishtar do, you ask? Just look at all the holes in the ranch! It's obvious!
[k]

＠Testimony: Rancher A
It's indiscriminate! She zooms around wildly, striking at random!
[k]

＠Testimony: Rancher A
And that smug laugh...

I can't take it... I've just had it... She always attacks right when we're busiest...

＠Testimony: Rancher B
Whoosh, whoosh from the sky... Back in my dad's time, she supposedly promised bountiful harvests once every three years,
[k]

＠Testimony: Rancher B
but this year, it's nothing but losses... It's a miracle that nobody has gotten hurt...
[k]

＠Testimony: Rancher B
And that smug laugh... She just continues with it, on and on...

I know I should feel fortunate that I at least got a glance of the goddess Ishtar.
[k]

＠Testimony: Rancher C
But I can't make a living just from gazing at beautiful things. Caring for sheep isn't cheap nowadays.
[k]

＠Testimony: Rancher C
It's hard enough just trying to drive the Demonic Beasts back, but when we get attacked from the sky, what can we do?
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Testimony: Rancher C
The young ones we hired to exterminate the beasts fled... Oh, and that smug laugh... She sounds like she's having fun...

＠Testimony: Rancher D
The goddess of fertility? Ha! In a few centuries, I'm pooooositive she'll be called the demon of Venus!
[k]

＠Testimony: Rancher D
My ranch is full of holes. My sheep ran off. On top of that, she's so merciless she kills off all the beasts under her command!
[k]

＠Testimony: Rancher D
To make matters worse, she lands and is all, “I'll take all the gems in your house!”
[k]

＠Testimony: Rancher D
“I'll let you off with this,” she says, and flies off with a smug laugh! Dammit!

...Those are all the testimonies from the ranchers.

＠Mash
Ishtar's indiscriminate attacks, obstructing ranch operations, and extorting the owners...
[k]

＠Mash
There's no doubt about it. Ishtar is one special, wicked devil...

The goddess of beauty who governs Venus is a greedy miser... It's true that Ishtar is a goddess that loves fortune, yes...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But she usually demands riches from the gods above her. There were no stories about her stealing money from humans...
[k]

...Yes. I agree with [%1]. Ishtar's actions all have something in common.

...So, we shouldn't flat-out call her a fiend. Of course, she is still a greedy devil.

＠Merlin
Oh, there's an interesting tidbit about that. Actually, that Ishtar isn't the normal Ishtar.
[k]

＠Merlin
Right when the Demonic Beasts showed up in the north, a certain ritual was held by Uruk's Sacred Temple without the king's knowledge.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Merlin
Simply put, they tried to summon Ishtar, the city's patron deity.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Merlin
Uruk is under imperial rule, but it's governed under three powers: the king, the Ritual Sect, and the Sacred Temple.
[k]

＠Merlin
Of these, the Sacred Temple favors the patron deity over King Gilgamesh.
[k]

＠Merlin
They saw the signs of this era turning into a Singularity, and saw the instability of space-time as their chance.
[k]

＠Merlin
As King Gilgamesh opened the treasury of Babylon, and built the fortress at the Northern Wall in Uruk,
[k]

＠Merlin
the temple matron first summoned a soul compatible with a goddess's divinity, and tried to summon Ishtar using that soul.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Merlin
It's what you call a Pseudo-Servant in Chaldea. I don't know if that ritual succeeded or not.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Merlin
But it is true that the patron deity of Uruk, Ishtar, has manifested nonetheless.
[k]

＠Merlin
Basically, the gods of Mesopotamia are blond. On the other hand, humans have black heads... black hair.
[k]

＠Merlin
That Ishtar has black hair, meaning it is definitely a girl that served as her vessel.

＠Dr. Roman
That's...so beyond surprising, I feel very sorry for her...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
According to the data observed here, that “Ishtar” is undoubtedly the goddess herself.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That girl must have been a human who was really compatible with her.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The two egos have completely fused together, and created a goddess that is completely new, yet still the same.

＠Ana
...You may be right. I may not get along with goddesses, but that Ishtar is ever so slightly human.
[k]

＠Merlin
Oh, it's so rare to hear your real feelings, Ana. How are things different if a goddess is like a human?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Ana
Oh...
[k]

＠Ana
...It's nothing. I hate both. I hate Merlin more, though.

By the way, Demonic Beasts are approaching from up ahead. Let's offer Merlin as a sacrifice so they let us pass.
