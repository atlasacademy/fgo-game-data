You finally noticed.[sr]Yes, I'm a Heroic Spirit like you. Or rather[line 3]

＠Boy
Did you think a kid reading rare books so calmly[sr]in a time like this is normal?
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Boy
The ability to detect magical energy aside, your intuition[sr]as a reader is abysmal, Saber. You should read more.

I recommend the series in shelf E on the 1st floor.[sr]They're full of dreams, adventures, and bad endings you might like.

Hans Christian Andersen, the author[line 2] Amazing...[sr]He's one of the top three fairy tale authors in the world, Senpai!
[k]

？！

First characters from fictional novels,[sr]now an actual author! And, our enemy is a book!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Okay, it's turning into another[sr]confusing situation, [%1]!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So how's Mr. Andersen?[sr]Is he amazing as a Servant!?
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
Huh? What does that bonehead expect?[sr]I'm an author. Of course I'm absolutely powerless.
[k]

＠Andersen
It's neat to encounter a Magical Tome that attacks[sr]people, but it's literally impossible for me to defeat it alone.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
So, here I am, waiting for Servants[sr]fit for physical labor to show up!

Now go fight, Saber and Ms. Avid Reader![sr]I'll keep detailed notes of the entire affair!

Say something? Oh, something beneficial.[sr]Hmm. Well then, here's a lecture.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
You have experienced the nature of the Magical Tome,[sr]yes? Attacks are ineffective. Of course they are.
[k]

＠Andersen
It's because you think it's a book.[sr]It's not. It's a type of Reality Marble.
[k]

[charaFadeout H 0.1]
[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 14]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Mash
Reality Marble!?
[k]

？1：Reality Marble?

？2：As I recall, that's...

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes. It's a type of powerful magecraft that rewrites how[sr]the world exists. They say it's almost equivalent to True Magic.
[k]

＠Mash
Rarely, there are cases when a Servant[sr]materialized uses it as their Noble Phantasm[line 3]
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]
[charaTalk H]
[charaFace H 0]
[charaFadein H 0.1 1]
＠Andersen
Right, maybe a Reality Marble affects the space it's in.[sr]But that's different. Its existence itself is a Reality Marble.
[k]

＠Andersen
That's why it has endurance near invincibility.[sr]It effectively utilizes the fact it is a Reality Marble.
[k]

＠Andersen
Then, why is that possible?[sr]Good. That's a natural question.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
But figure out that much on your own! There's plenty of[sr]food for thought, anyone can make sense of it in minutes!

＠Mordred
But we don't have those few minutes![sr]State the conclusion! The conclusion!
[k]

＠Mordred
It's floating right now,[sr]but we don't know when it will attack again!
[k]

[charaFace H 3]
＠Andersen
How hasty... Do you start books at the ending? Oh, fine.[sr]Out of respect for the avid reader, I'll tell you.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
My reason by analogy is that it originally[sr]was a Servant that projects the psyche of its Master.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
It's easy if you elicit from dramaturgy.[sr]Though, I needed to ponder for about an hour.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
You took your sweet time![sr]Enough! State the conclusion! The conclusion!
[k]

＠Andersen
The conclusion, or rather, the problem is before you.[sr]This is a "stray." There is no Master.
[k]

＠Andersen
That's why it attacked the people in Soho.[sr]It put them to sleep and made them dream.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
In short, it's searching for a Master. To manifest the[sr]dream, it's "trying to materialize" as a Pseudo-Servant.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
What?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...I see![sr]So the guise of this Magical Tome has no substance!
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Andersen
Good answer! It's not even a Servant. It's a clump[sr]of magical energy that wants to be a Servant.
[k]

＠Andersen
It will materialize eventually if left alone.[sr]In return, every citizen of Soho will fall asleep.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Andersen
Compared to the fog of magical energy drifting outside,[sr]the damage may not be as vicious.
[k]

＠Andersen
However.
[k]

＠Andersen
Some may become emaciated and die while asleep,[sr]but perhaps nobody will die.
[k]

[charaFace H 2]
＠Andersen
To begin with, if sleep takes so much of one's time,[sr]we writers would go out of business!
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Andersen
So, it will be defeated.[sr]Soho has many bookstores, both new and used.
