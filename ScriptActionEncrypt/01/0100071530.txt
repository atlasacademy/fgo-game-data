＠Merlin
It's time. We already have troops assembled inside the Northern Wall.
[k]

＠Merlin
An hour after we leave here, the troops will be deployed to prepare for the decisive battle on the Demonic Front.
[k]

＠Merlin
I'd give it about a fifty-fifty chance that Gorgon will be lured by our diversion. But the Demonic Beasts will definitely come out of the Cedar Forest.
[k]

＠Merlin
That's how strong their desire for revenge against humans is.
[k]

＠Merlin
They won't be able to suppress their urges if the humans form a line against the wall.

...Once we have confirmation of that, we will infiltrate the Cedar Forest from the ruined city of Babylon and head for the Blood Fort.

Roger that. I'll redirect three slides of Sheba on Quetzalcoatl, and monitor the situation at the Northern Wall.

We've got enemy signatures already! It looks like a group of rogue Demonic Beasts from Babylon!

This will be a skirmish before you enter the Cedar Forest! Let's do this, [%1]!
