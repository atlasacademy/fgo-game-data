＠David
Like I said before, the "Ark"[sr]brings death to all things[line 2]
[k]

＠David
Sacrificing a soul that exists as a god, regardless[sr]of rank, would cause the box to lose control.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠David
The death of a god means the death of the world.[sr]The Ark is a disaster from that kind of era.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠David
If this was a normal world, it would only destroy[sr]the surrounding area, but, hmm...
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠David
This is an unstable place that normally wouldn't exist,[sr]right? I doubt such a groundless world like this can survive.
[k]

＠David
Um, a Singularity, was it? The thing blurring the[sr]foundation of human history.
[k]

＠David
This whole era will disappear[sr]without having to wait for its collapse.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Drake
There'd be no need to use a weird Holy Grail...[sr]or even steal mine, for that matter.
[k]

＠Drake
They can use that box to sacrifice a goddess,[sr]and at that point it will all be over.

...Why does Jason[sr]want to destroy the world so badly?

＠Atalante
Who knows?[sr]...He may not even know himself.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Atalante
Somebody may have convinced him that all he has to do[sr]is offer Euryale to the "Ark."
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
[line 2]Either way.
[k]

＠Mash
We know why they're after this Noble Phantasm,[sr]and why we absolutely must stop them.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
The question is how do we defeat them...[sr]By the way, David, is your class Archer?
[k]

＠David
That's right. Atalante is an Archer as well.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Talk about unbalanced. Four Archers, a Shielder,[sr]and one Pirate...

＠Atalante
We're up against Heracles, Medea, and Hektor.[sr]We don't have to count Jason, I suppose.
[k]

？1：Why?

？2：Is he that weak?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
[charaFace E 1]
＠Atalante
He's weak.[sr]Rather, he's never actually fought.
[k]

＠Atalante
He's a monster who formed the Argonauts with just[sr]charisma and eloquence, but he's no fighter.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Atalante
But I doubt having one useless member in their party[sr]poses any problems for them.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Atalante
...They have Heracles, after all.
[k]

＠Mash
Multiple resurrections from the Twelve Labors.[sr]And above all else, his prominent combat techniques.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
I don't see how we can beat him.

We, on the other hand, are full of fighters who[sr]specialize in long-distance combat.

＠David
If we can get him to touch the "Ark,"[sr]we might be able to instantly obliterate him.
[k]

[charaFadein H 0.1 2]
＠Artemis
Would he touch it that easily?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠David
It's a what-if. Even a Berserker can sense the magical energy around Noble Phantasms. You'd never walk up to a bomb, right?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠David
If he had no choice but to touch it, then maybe...[sr]But how could we force that situation?
