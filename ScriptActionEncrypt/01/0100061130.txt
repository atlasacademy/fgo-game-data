Wait, I do know you. You look different now, but I remember the scent of your magical energy.

＠Mordred
I was wondering why you didn't respond to Father's summons. What the hell are you doing here!?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
Don't tell me you were one of the rebels? ...So that's it, then. Well, hardly surprising, considering it's you.
[k]

＠Mordred
You're about the only one who dares to object to King Arthur nowadays. Though you got here a bit too late.

That mage there must be the Master everyone's talking about. I'm gonna do Agravain a favor and cut you up into pieces!

？1：I don't want to fight you!

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
What's that? You know me too? Tch.[sr]Being a Servant is such a hassle.
[k]

＠Mordred
Anyway, just give it up. I don't know what kind of moron the Mordred you knew was, and I don't give a shit anyway.
[k]

＠Mordred
Right now I am a knight serving the Lion King. I'm the great Raider Knight Mordred, and it is my duty to be a dishonorable hound.
[k]

＠Mordred
Do you understand? I've been let off my leash, meaning it's okay for me to do whatever I please!
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
Hah! That's the best way to handle someone like me! I'll kill whoever dares to defy the king, no matter who they may be!

＠Mordred
Obvious, isn't it?! Because it's sooo fun!

＠Mordred
It's great, hunting heathens, you know? Despite their weakness, they fight so desperately, they resist[line 3]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
and then they die off like flies, one after the other! Now I know how the Crusaders must've felt!

Well, I was hoping this would turn into a fight.[sr]See, my Gift is called “Rampage.”
[k]

＠Mordred
And that means I'll fire off my sacred sword as much as I want, until my soul burns out. Battalions? Armies? Bring it!
[k]

＠Mordred
Let's see... There's one, two, three...[sr]What? [charaFace E 2]Only three of you?

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 1.0]

Just one Master and three Servants!? That's not a fight! It's not even a game! There's no way I'd[line 3] Oh, hang on...

Treacherous Knight Mordred. The traitor who trampled all over King Arthur's ideals.
