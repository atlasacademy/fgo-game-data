...Arjuna... What did he...
[k]

＠Nightingale
It means he was able to sort out his feelings.
[k]

＠Nightingale
He is not as faithful as others think,[sr]nor as evil as he himself believes.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Nightingale
He must've led quite a stifling life when he was alive.
[k]

＠Nightingale
After all, he'd been living a life that was decided for him by someone else.

But despite that, we must forge ahead.

Nightingale is right. All right, march on! Let's charge all the way to Washington!
