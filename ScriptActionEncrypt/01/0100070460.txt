＠Merlin
No, I was out all night and just got back. I wanted to head straight to my room, but I needed to talk to you.
[k]

＠Merlin
It's been 20 days. Have you gotten used to life here in Uruk?
[k]

？1：Fortunately, yes.
？2：It's actually pretty fun here.

？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠Merlin
Good. That's evidence you're a creature who adapts well.
[k]

＠Merlin
Humans have beautiful and amazing dreams because they enjoy everything they see.

But unfortunately, I do have some bad news.[sr]Here's a message from Siduri:

＠Merlin
“No requests today.[sr]Please use this day off to enjoy Uruk.”

A day off...? That's good, but...[sr]It is a bit disappointing, Senpai.

＠Mash
I was excited to see what work we'd get today.

If it's a secret rendezvous you want, I recommend the gardens in front of Eanna. Since it's Ishtar's bedroom, it has a fantastic variety of flowers.

...Excuse me. Do the both of you have a spare moment?
[k]

＠Ana
If so, I have a job I'd like to ask you to do.
[k]

＠Ana
...Here's all the silver I've managed to save up.[sr]I've exchanged it for King's Silver. I have seven.
[k]

＠Ana
Would that be enough to have you accompany me for the day?

Of course. We couldn't turn down a request from you, Ana. Payment isn't necessary either.

Isn't that right, Senpai?[sr]We were just looking for some work worth doing!

？1：Mash is right. Leave it to us, Ana.
