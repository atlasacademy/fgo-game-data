You are already a Servant. Meaning there's no point for you to repeat actions taken when you were alive.
[k]

＠H：???
You have no reason nor responsibility to go back home. In fact, your home doesn't even exist in this world.

So, please enlighten me, where exactly are you going?

My purpose is to go home. I am a monk whose worth is in the steps I've spent on my journey. And I get really lonely without my disciples.

[charaFace B 1]

Yes, I do find this city amazing. It's peaceful, prosperous, beautiful, and no one is hungry.

That no one shall stop Xuanzang Sanzang if she says she is going to leave the castle.

You gotta be kidding. It's such a perfect chance to stab her in the back.

Did the king say anything else? About the Holy City, about how we are protecting it?
[k]

＠Agravain
Know your place. The king has no words for the likes of you. Only your loyalty is required of you.

＠Agravain
Yes, Xuanzang Sanzang is a foreigner. However, she was not the traitor that the star-seer prophecized. That's all.

What you should be worrying about are any foreigners arriving next. The burden of protecting humanity is surely heavy.

＠Agravain
Soon, the last Master of this world shall arrive. The king has instructed us not to show disrespect to our guests.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Agravain
However, the king bears the responsibility of shouldering the entire world. We will deal with all the trivialities ourselves.

Is that understood, O brave Knights of the Round Table? I expect true loyalty from all of you.
