Amazing, you did it...! Confirming collapse of Tiamat's Spirit Origin!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Magical Reactor has also stopped! Your attacks defeated Tiamat, mud and all!

＠Dr. Roman
Now just wait for the ocean to return to normal, retrieve the Grail, and mission accomplished!

...Um, Senpai. I had this feeling during the battle with Tiamat,

but perhaps those restraints that tied her down...I think she made them herself.
[k]

？1：What do you mean...?
？2：Tiamat was binding herself...?

？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Mash
...I can't be positive about this, but that's the only logical explanation. I mean, Tiamat was, well...
[k]

＠Mash
She was voluntarily taking our attacks. As if she was giving us her life.
[k]

＠Mash
We simply couldn't comprehend her intent... It seems Tiamat was awakened by the power of the Holy Grail...
[k]

＠Mash
But perhaps if the Laḫmu hadn't delivered the Holy Grail, she would have stayed in the ocean forever?

...Truly a monster.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A mobile creature factory. She has enough magical energy to travel between stars. She has ample life origins stored within her body...

＠Dr. Roman
Humanity needs a few more centuries to reach this divine ark... This is...this is the Tiamat's true form!
[k]


＠Ishtar
She's not even looking at us... She's glaring straight ahead towards Uruk...
[k]

＠Ishtar
Looks like we're being spared for now, but what should we do!? Quetzalcoatl, what do you think?
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
We absoooollllllutely can't win! Nope!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
I mean, the difference in size is mind-blowing, no!? I can't use a joint lock on her, the most powerful move in lucha!
[k]

？1：Of course not.

＠Quetzalcoatl
Si! Nice response, [%1]! A sense of humor is important!
[k]

？2：Quetzalcoatl, can't you grow bigger?

＠Quetzalcoatl
That's impossible, no! Conservation of mass works for gods as well! It's a laaaaaw!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
That kind of Authority only existed in the era of Genesis! Not even aliens can take that thing down now!
[k]

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Quetzalcoatl. Are you saying you can't defeat Tiamat even with your real Noble Phantasm... Even with your full-powered Authority?
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
...No. It'd be cruel to get your hopes up, so I will be blunt.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Even with Ishtar's Authority, or with any other power currently left in Mesopotamia[line 3]

＠Quetzalcoatl
We can't so much as scratch Tiamat.

＠Dr. Roman
...I see. Thanks. I get the situation now.
