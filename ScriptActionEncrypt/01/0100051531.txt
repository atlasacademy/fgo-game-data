[line 2]Protect, you say? For someone trying to protect, you have a rather illogical method of fighting.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]

What...[sr]D-Did you just call me...illogical?
[k]

＠Nightingale
Yes. Extremely illogical.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

I am always logical![sr]Both this nation and I are children of logic.

＠Edison
It can't possibly be illogical[line 2]
[k]

＠Nightingale
...We can't win.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Edison
...What?
[k]

＠Nightingale
Those Celts are monsters who spend all their time fighting, from birth to death.
[k]

＠Nightingale
People of this era are already falling behind, right at the starting line.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Moreover, the revered Queen Medb possesses the Holy Grail, allowing her to create soldiers infinitely.
[k]

＠Nightingale
That's why we can't win. There's simply no way to win.
[k]

＠Nightingale
The Holy Grail is the only resource they need to reinforce their army. The idea of strength in numbers was a mistake to begin with.
[k]

＠Nightingale
But you didn't let up your ground.[sr]Rather, you didn't want to give up that system.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Because[line 3]
[k]

＠Nightingale
Mass production. Cheaper, more efficient production.[sr]That was what you, Thomas Edison, were ingenious at.
[k]

＠Nightingale
But those aesthetics strip you of the intelligence you originally had.
[k]

＠Nightingale
You thought, “I cannot lose on my home turf.”[sr]And subconsciously, you got worked up over it.
[k]

＠Nightingale
And because you kept grumbling like that,[sr]you were corrupted by such an illness.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Edison
Erm... W-Well, but... But... Why... I cannot deny that...
[k]

＠Edison
True, I was fixated on productivity. Even if we run out of resources, as long as we obtain victory at the end...
[k]

[charaFace C 7]
＠Nightingale
Indeed. There's no point winning in just the field of productivity. BUT! MOST! OF! ALL!
[k]

＠Nightingale
The biggest mistake is your body itself!
[k]

＠Nightingale
There are no records that indicate Edison had the head of a lion.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Furthermore, it is impossible for you to have such strength.
[k]

＠Nightingale
That means you possess power that doesn't belong to you. That is the dream pushing you to become “king.”

＠Edison
I am the Presi-king of the United States of America.[sr]Past, present, and future...
[k]

＠Edison
The successive presidents of this nation granted me power. Because it was logical.
[k]

＠Edison
They came to the conclusion that even if they were all summoned as Servants, they would lose to the Celts.
[k]

＠Edison
So, why not concentrate all the power into a single person. Not a president, but a hero with international fame.

＠Nightingale
E pluribus unum.
[k]

＠Nightingale
You are a state made up of many races, equivalent to being children of many nations.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Which is why you have an obligation to save the world.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Yet you divert your eyes and try to save only your own nation[line 2]that is why Edison suffers.

Hrng... Guh...

That is also why[line 2]you were defeated by Nikola Tesla, your fellow inventor.
