Physical activity relaxes the mind,[sr]but in the end, there are only two ways to go about this.

Is one of them... assassination?

＠Scáthach
A select few will go to Washington D.C., and assassinate Queen Medb.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Scáthach
That should prevent any further increase in Celtic soldiers. We can turn this into a fight between Servants.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Scáthach
But Medb is extremely cautious.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Once she senses Servants, she will likely bring all her Servants back at once.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Scáthach
To be honest, she's already survived one assassination attempt. I would expect her to be even more cautious.

Painfully true. What do you think,[sr]Chief Nurse Nightingale? Quite the pickle, isn't it?
[k]

[charaFace C 6]
＠Nightingale
...I shall leave military problems of this sort to you. I am just a nurse.
[k]

I'm telling you that I'm useless. Sheesh...

[charaFace C 6]
＠Nightingale
If an ambush is impossible, we fight them head-on.[sr]That's about all I can think up right now.

＠Rama
We place mechanized infantry and Servants both to the north and south.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Rama
Of the two armies, one simply needs to hold its ground.[sr]Meanwhile, the main army will rush towards the capital.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

...What do you say, Scáthach?

＠Scáthach
That's right.[sr]There are several Servants here.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Scáthach
Some Servants are powerful enough to rival the enemy, myself included. However, there aren't enough for “two even armies.”
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Scáthach
But if we concentrate forces into one army, the other will crumble, and the enemy will occupy America.
[k]

＠Scáthach
All types of balance must be considered when forming the North and South armies.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Scáthach
Now, how to handle it...

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Elisabeth
Naturally. You fought alongside Servants in France, Rome, and all sorts of other places, right?
[k]

＠Elisabeth
No other Master in the world is as familiar with Servants as you are.

If you choose the teams,[sr]I can trust those decisions!

...Edison's wounds are healed. His responsibilities as King of America should've been lessened.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Or perhaps the obsessions of past presidents had been possessing him.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Nightingale
There is a chance for a poor prognosis, so I need to continue monitoring him...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Nightingale
One illness left.[sr]I only hope then the world will be healed.
[k]

？1：I'll try my best.
？2：Yeah, we have to make it work.
？！

[charaFace C 6]
＠Nightingale
I have no intention of putting you under any pressure.[sr]I hope you don't misunderstand.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Normally, it's insane to have just one person bear the responsibilities of stopping world destruction.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Nightingale
That is indeed a dire move.[sr]Only the insane could withstand the pressure.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Nightingale
Like I once was.[sr]...But you are different.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Nightingale
You must remain steadfast and assign us to our posts.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Nightingale
I trust you. The same way I trust my comrades who fought against the stubborn army.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Nightingale
You need to make an effort.[sr]But there is no need to bear the entire burden.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Moreover, even if your choice is correct,[sr]there is the possibility that we, the entrusted, will fail.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Nightingale
Even with utmost preparations,[sr]soldiers will die, and people will fall ill.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Nightingale
So, I hope you do not shoulder too much weight.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Relax, but be honest[line 2][sr]I'm sure we will be fine.

Do you find the night breeze a bit chilly? Let's return.

A corpse is a mound of pathogens. We must carefully mourn them, and send them to the afterlife!
