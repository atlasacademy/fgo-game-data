[line]This is a "doomed world" situation, isn't it?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Sakata Kintoki
My sense of smell is always accurate.[sr]If we don't stop you, the world's in trouble, right?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Seems you want to head to the sky. If that happens, the[sr]world's all messed up from fog and lightning on top of fire.

Wonderful. Your understanding is as sharp as lightning,[sr]and just as quick!
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
Correct. The world ends if you don't stop me!
[k]

[charaFace H 3]
＠Nikola Tesla
But[line 3]Oh, I see.[sr]My oh my. Some things are truly interesting.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
A truly fascinating case. The lightning acted as catalyst[sr]for the Demonic Fog to summon a new Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Nikola Tesla
Sakata Kintoki, you said? Seems you're another[sr]hero opposing the creation of a new legend.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
If you were a Heroic Spirit of Heaven or Earth from old[sr]myths, I'd have burned you up with a laugh, but you're...
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Nikola Tesla
"A Heroic Spirit of the Humans," huh?
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
You're one trying to hinder my path.[sr]You're someone willing to fight next to humans.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Nikola Tesla
Isn't that right, Sakata Kintoki? No, I suppose I should[sr]call you Mr. Golden. I shall. No, I must.
[k]

Yes, you could be none other than Golden![sr]Dazzling, just like plasma!

This is London, right?[sr]The city of fog, London, right?

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Where's the dreamy double-decker buses?[sr]Where's the British Museum, Clock Tower, St. Paul's Cathedral?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
What's with this ominous fog?[sr]Why isn't there anyone here, even though it's midday?
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
And where are the fish and chips I was looking forward[sr]to? And that afternoon tea I was secretly yearning for?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
What about the scones? Clotted cream?[sr]Fortnum & Mason's flagship store?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
A majority of this area feels abandoned, no?
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Mikon?[sr]Is London facing swift annihilation or something?

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I tagged along to vacation in London so I could rehearse[sr]my honeymoon with my Master, and this is what I get?

My words hold no meaning. I merely here[sr]to accomplish one act, contrary to my words!

That helps. But wait,[sr]you just took a free ride on my summons...
[k]

How about we talk about this later? Look over there.[sr]That hottie over there is already ready to fight, no?

Um, Kintoki? You stopped talking all of a sudden and[sr]averted your gaze. What's wrong? (push)
