...What I just spoke about was out of line.[sr]Let's get going.
[k]

？1：Don't you want to follow her?

？2：Do you still love Marie?

？！

[charaFace F 0]
＠Amadeus
Certainly not. I have no more passion for her.[sr]She was just a special divergence in my fate.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Amadeus
If I'd led a decent life, the divergence would've been that proposal.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Amadeus
Like what you'd call the cornerstone of human history.
[k]

＠Amadeus
What choices would this man, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, have made to end up this way?
[k]

＠Amadeus
No matter what happens. No matter what lovers I meet,[sr]what friends I gain, what bliss I grasp.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Amadeus
I would offer my life to music, and become a scum that abandons all human virtue.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Amadeus
But there's just one thing.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Amadeus
If there were someone who could change my fate, I think it would've been her.

...Amadeus. Doesn't that mean that you love Marie?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Amadeus
Oh, sure. I do love her. It's just that I'm not in love[sr]with her any more. Is there a problem with that.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...I don't know.[sr]Before you said that we humans are filthy.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
Based on what you said, that means you think[sr]Marie is also filthy without exception...
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Amadeus
So what? I love anything filthy.[sr]Music is beautiful. We humans are filthy.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Amadeus
You weren't aware of such differences?[sr]It's just a matter of category, isn't it?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Well...what?[sr]You said that humans only love beautiful things...
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Amadeus
It's not that we can only love something beautiful.[sr]What I meant was humans can love beautiful things, too.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Well...To me, that difference is too abstract...
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Amadeus
Hmm, I guess I can't make you understand it with words.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Amadeus
You'll understand someday. You're going to continue your journey with [%1], right?
[k]

＠Amadeus
Then you'll figure it out. When it comes to the topic of humanity, [&he:she] is an ideal Senpai.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Y-Yes![sr]I can completely understand the "ideal Senpai" part!
[k]

？1：Mash!

？2：Trust can be heavy sometimes.

？！

But I hope you'll understand what made me drop my guard.

You know, I thought he was as much of a loser as me,[sr]but he's actually a great person with a deep view on life.
