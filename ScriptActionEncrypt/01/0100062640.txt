Of course! I am the King of the Sun, the king of all gods!

That aside, well fought! Your strength is befitting of taking on the Lion King, who fancies himself a god.

Accompany...? I mean, yes, of course, if that is your wish! But, in what should I accompany you!?

Hear ye! My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings! Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair!

The Demon God Pillar was but an opening act! Witness the pharaoh's fighting methods, passed down from his forefathers!
