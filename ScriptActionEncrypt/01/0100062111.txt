Gosh, Touta. Honestly! You mustn't stray from your mentor, you hear?
[k]

＠Sanzang
A good disciple is supposed to be aware of his mentor at all times, not lose sight of her!

Hm. It's gotten to the point where replying would be stupid. If anything, I was the idiot.

[charaFace F 1]
＠Tawara Touta
It's true, you are a good mentor. I've never seen a monk who makes her disciple so frantic!

＠Sanzang
What's that? Was that a compliment? That was a compliment, wasn't it?

Yes, true, true. Looks like you're finally ready for the Sravaka, Touta!

I've no idea what she's saying, but I'm glad it all worked out.
[k]

＠Bedivere
It may have been in a panic, but she was able to ward off the sphinxes on her own.

...The sphinxes, you say? Um, is that...
[k]

？1：Sanzang, what'd you do with the sphinxes?

If you think about it, they serve as a landmark, huh? So is this also the Buddha's protection? How terrifying...

Sanzang, just go wherever you want. Leave the protection to us.

What, you want me to lead the way?

Well, why didn't you just say so?! I'd be happy to! Follow me!

Like, it feels like something bad's closing in from behind, you know?
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Sanzang
It's probably a violent boulder or something, so be sure to catch it when it comes rolling, alright?
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Tawara Touta
A bad feeling, huh? I can't laugh at your intuition anymore... Looks like we'd better hurry.
