Amazing... What a citadel. This is the heart of this era, the area where the Holy Land was.

Such massive white walls, as if to reject anything foreign... That's... the Holy City?

A bunch of refugees have gathered there... Somewhere around a thousand people, perhaps?

They're probably waiting for that Ritual of Holy Selection. Perfect timing. You should go along with them.

＠Dr. Roman
As long as you're inside the Holy City, there should be an opportunity to see the Lion King.

Sounds good. I suppose I'll fold up the ornithopter now.

Heh heh heh... What a beauty we've got here. Did you come from the desert? Those are some expensive-looking clothes.
[k]

＠???
It looks like you're here for the Ritual of Holy Selection.[sr]I won't think ill of you. You should turn back.
[k]

＠???
Of course, that'll be after you drop all your possessions. Don't worry, I'll pay you 10% of the market value.
[k]

＠???
...Man, thanks to the Lion King I can just wait out here, and suckers like you show up one after another.

I see, you're a scammer trying to take advantage of refugees. I shouldn't say this, but that's pretty efficient!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
However, I can't allow a business to prey upon the weak!

＠Da Vinci
[%1], go right ahead and discipline them!

？1：Leave it to me!
？2：You be careful too, Da Vinci!
