＠Mash
...Phew, the battle is over Master.[sr]I'm relieved that we pulled through again.
[k]

？1：Good work, Mash.

？2：Thank you, Mash.

？！

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
...Yes.[sr]I am happy that I can be useful.

＠Olga Marie
...Hey, Mash.[sr]Is it possible that you can't use your Noble Phantasm?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Apparently. I don't even know which Heroic Spirit fused with me...
[k]

＠Mash
...and I'm unable to use the power of its Special Arts,[sr]the Heroic Spirit's secret weapon[line 3]known as a Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Mash
[%1] Senpai.[sr]I'm sorry for explaining this so late.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Servants are equipped with a unique skill called a [FF0000]Noble Phantasm[-].
[k]

＠Mash
It's derived from each hero's legend and great deeds, and is a secret weapon.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
However, I am unable to wield my Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Mash
...I can somehow use it as a weapon, but its output is decreased. I can't even release its True Name.
[k]

＠Mash
In fact, I don't even know what the origins of this weapon of mine might be.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
In any case, you can think of me as a failed Servant.[sr]Or maybe just a capable kouhai that can get even stronger.
[k]

＠Mash
I don't have any leads on the Heroic Spirit that fused with me, but with you as my Master I will figure it out as I grow.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That's true. Masters have the ability to analyze their Servants parameters, skills, and matrixes.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
[%1]... As a Master, once you become good enough, you should be able to analyze Mash's Servant data.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Any Servants you make a contract with from this point[sr]should be the same. First, you need to learn their True Name and Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
As your trust with them grows, your Servant's power will grow too.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Well, it's not like you have that much potential in you.[sr]The fact that you can't use Mash that well shows that.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Once we get Chaldea's Rayshift capability back online, we're going to shift a first-class Master here.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Then you're fired. Newbies with no combat experience can spend their time terrified in some corner in Chaldea.
[k]

？1：Weren't you the one scared, Director Marie?

[charaFace E 1]
＠Olga Marie
I wasn't! Not in the least![sr]You should be respectful to your elders!
[k]

？2：Could it be that you're worried about me?

[charaFace E 4]
＠Olga Marie
O-Of course! You're our only fighting force here![sr]If you get taken out, who's going to fight?
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Anyway, I'm glad you two understand each other[sr]better now. Let's move before any more of them show up.
