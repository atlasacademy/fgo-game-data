Say, [%1]. Your court mage...[sr]Dr. Maron, was it?
[k]

＠Mordred
Can't he make us a far-seeing crystal or something?[sr]That would have been a snap for Merlin...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Roman! My name is Roman![sr]And don't compare me to Merlin!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He was the ultimate hermit wizard![sr]I'm just a modern-day doctor!

＠Mordred
Huh!? You're a mage and you're saying you don't[sr]know!? Merlin! I'm talking about Merlin!
[k]

＠Mordred
King Arthur's successor and mastermind of the Round[sr]Table. He was a great mage born half-human, half-incubus.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
He isn't famous anymore?[sr]Haha! That feels great! Serves him right!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Merlin was one of the world's most renowned[sr]kingmakers. He was also behind Arthur pulling the sword from the stone.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Apparently, he had extraordinary magecraft skills, but[sr]was ultimately imprisoned at world's end for woman trouble.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
Yeah. I heard he's all crabby and in a tower[sr]at a corner of Avalon, unable to leave or die.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
How can I put it? He was a flighty bastard. Imagine[sr]a perpetual flurry of flowers behind him... do you get me?
[k]

？1：I do.

？2：I don't.

？！

＠Mordred
Well, whatever. Enough about him.[sr]He's so spineless he can't even rush over to London's calamity.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
...More importantly.[sr]Tell me, [%1], are you okay with that?
[k]

？1：Okay with what?

？2：What's wrong?

？！

[charaFace E 3]

＠Mash
...Yes. Physically, there's nothing wrong with me, but...[sr]...mentally, I have a problem.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...I'm sorry, Senpai. Our battles are getting more intense,[sr]but I haven't been improving at all...

＠Mash
...It's my Noble Phantasm.[sr]Servants' true fighting powers lie in Noble Phantasms.
[k]

＠Mash
I've seen many Noble Phantasms up till now.[sr]All of them have been miracles worthy of their heroic names.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Yet, I still[line 3][sr]can't use my Noble Phantasm properly.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...At this rate, I'm just a burden. I know that,[sr]but I still can't remember his True Name...
[k]

？1：Even without a Noble Phantasm...

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mash
No, I need a Noble Phantasm!
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
Ah, um... I'm sorry I yelled at you.[sr]But it will definitely become necessary...that's my hunch.
[k]

？2：It's not your fault, Mash.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Indeed, the merge was due to a sudden accident.[sr]But he entrusted me with everything...
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
The point is, I'm not oblivious of the Noble Phantasm's[sr]true value. I don't even know his True Name...
[k]

＠Mordred
So that's what this is about. You heard Helter Skelter[sr]is a Noble Phantasm and became depressed.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
True, a Servant who cannot use a Noble Phantasm[sr]is no Servant at all.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
No matter how weak the Noble Phantasm, its very[sr]existence is proof of that hero. It's a matter of pride.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
But you're different, Mash. You're you. How you think[sr]and your honor are different from that Shield bastard.
[k]

＠Mordred
It's true you haven't mastered using that Noble[sr]Phantasm. From what I've seen, you're about a third of the way there.
[k]

＠Mordred
The remaining two-thirds are untapped. Or maybe you,[sr]being you, won't get to 100% and that's that.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...So it is like that.
[k]

＠Mash
The "Demi" side... The human part of me[sr]is dragging Senpai down...
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
Fool. That's ridiculous.[sr]Listen until I'm done talking.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
You're not fully utilizing your Noble Phantasm. But I'm[sr]sure[line 3]you're stronger than the original Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Huh? The original Heroic Spirit...[sr]You mean the Heroic Spirit that I merged with?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Mordred
Yes. You're much, much stronger than him.[sr]That's coming from me, so there's no doubt about it.
[k]

＠Mordred
You may come up short not having a Noble Phantasm,[sr]but not anywhere else. Am I right, [%1]?
[k]

＠Mordred
For you,[sr]Mash is the perfect partner, isn't she?
[k]

？1：Of course!

？2：I'll do something about that Noble Phantasm!

？！

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
...[sr]I-Is that really the case?
[k]

＠Mash
...Okay.[sr]If that's the case, I feel much better.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
There, you see? In the first place, it's a Master's job[sr]to take care of their Servant.
[k]

＠Mordred
Whether you can utilize the true value of a Noble[sr]Phantasm is [%1]'s problem, not yours, Mash.
[k]

＠Mordred
Right, [%1]?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
Before Mash can become a full-fledged Servant,[sr]you need to become a first-rate Master.
[k]

？1：We'll be first-rate together.

？2：I'll teach you how to use it eventually.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
[line 3]Right!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...All right, can we get moving soon?[sr]I'm sorry, as everyone is in a good mood, but...

Hmmph. [%1], summon a Rider Servant and have it give Maron a swift kick with its hind legs.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah, yeah, it's all my fault. My fault! Now, time for[sr]combat. Multiple hostile readings approaching!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Go rout them to liven things up!
