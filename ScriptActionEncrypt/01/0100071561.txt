...!? The observation got cut off! Sheba is turning black, and the light is not coming back!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[%1], what's going on over there!? Gorgon is dead! The threat to that era is no more!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So why does the Seventh Singularity still exist?

[k]

＠Kingu
To think things would come to an end a day earlier than expected. She might've gone too far, but she did a fine job for us.
[k]

＠Kingu
So... I wanted her to live just a bit longer before Mother's awakening.

It's a space-time quake! We speculate the spatial rifts are occurring all over Mesopotamia!

That's right, you tricky incubus.

＠Kingu
You put Mother in a cage of dreams to postpone her awakening.
[k]

＠Kingu
But when she fell asleep, she gave me the Grail and made me her first son.
[k]

＠Kingu
Which meant that I had only one job: find a way for her to awaken.
[k]

＠Kingu
It was simple enough. If she wouldn't wake up while alive, all I had to do was kill her.

Gorgon didn't have Tiamat's Authority because she was a copy.

She was synchronized... She shared her senses with the real Tiamat to gain Potnia Theron...!

That's right. And now Gorgon is dead.

＠Kingu
Gorgon's death reverberated back to the synchronized Tiamat, and awakened her from her slumber.
[k]

＠Kingu
As a result, you revealed yourself within her dreams, and she crushed you. Brutally.

Detecting a large number of unknown magical energy signatures in the Persian Gulf! Each one is stronger than an Ugallu's!

Their numbers... Their total numbers are...

Over one hundred million, and still growing!

But don't worry. You will be destroyed, but humanity will live on.

＠Kingu
The ones who will soon cover the earth are the next generation: perfect humans that she designed.
[k]

＠Kingu
The old humanity will disappear here, now. This planet is ours.

＠Kingu
It's goodbye for real this time. You can meet your end quietly, in a land covered by these new beings.

Tell him that one of the Beasts of the Counter Force, one that devours humanity, one that can only be beaten by the seven Grands, has roused from her slumber.

...The Sea of Life. The Primordial Mother. One of the Seven Evils of Humanity, and one of the Beasts of Original Sin... is awake.
