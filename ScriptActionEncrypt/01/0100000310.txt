Stop. Before we start exploring the city,[sr][%1], isn't there something you want to say to me?

＠Olga Marie
Not quite on time, but it looks like everybody's here.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Welcome to Special Organization, Chaldea.[sr]I'm the director, Olga Marie Animusphere.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
You have been selected, or discovered from each nation for your rare talents.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
By talent, I mean your aptitude for Spiritrons. People with magical circuits capable of becoming Masters.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
I'm sure you can't even imagine it, but be sure to keep this in mind.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
You are about to be reborn as cutting-edge mages, in an unprecedented fusion of magecraft and science.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That said, although all of you possess special talents, none of you are special.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Understand that you're all inexperienced rookies, standing at the same starting point.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
In particular, the mages sent from the Association still seem to be acting like students. Fix that immediately.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Chaldea is my domain. Family heritage and[sr]personal achievements have no meaning here.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Always remember that my orders are absolute.[sr]My position is completely different from yours.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
I won't allow arguments.[sr]You're all mere tools to protect humanity, nothing more.

＠Olga Marie
You there. The one who came in late.[sr]Do you have a problem with what I just said?
[k]

？1：...

？2：...Yawn.

？！

[charaFace E 3]
＠Olga Marie
Uh... Am I seeing this right?[sr]Maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me?
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Sleeping while standing...[sr]No way, right? Not in a million years...

[charaFace E 4]
＠New Hire (Female)
Hey, I didn't sign up for this! We're experts[sr]who were summoned here because of our skills!
[k]

＠New Hire (Female)
We came all this way on your insistence.[sr]Absolute obedience? That's ridiculous!
[k]

＠New Hire (Male)
She's right, you're way overstepping!
[k]

＠New Hire (Male)
Lineage is the most important asset for a mage![sr]How can you brush it off?

Not that there are flights to send you home.

Though if you're ready to trek down a snowy mountain 6,000 meters above sea level, that would be commendable.

I wish you'd realize that's how dire our, no, humanity's situation is now.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Look. [&He:She] is a good example.[sr]No argument, no opinion. Good and obedient.
