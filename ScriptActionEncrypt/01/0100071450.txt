[charaFace D 0]
＠Gilgamesh
She's an old goddess like Ishtar, but in terms of raw power, she's not as impressive.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Ishtar was a daughter of the heavens, so she got everything she wanted.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

The gods spoiled her, and tended to her every beck and call.

Also, Ishtar got Enki, the god of the Abyss, drunk, and robbed him blind.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Gilgamesh
That was pretty bad. It was the greatest heist in the history of the gods. It was also pretty funny, even to the other gods.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Enki got completely smashed, and gave all of his divinity to Ishtar. When he woke up he had nothing left.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Ishtar had already loaded all his wealth onto Maanna, and was on her way back to the surface.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Enki went into a panic and had his slaves chase after her, but the Boat of Heaven was far too fast.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Enki was in tears.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
He wrung his hands and screamed, warning that a stupid, bratty girl was going to run the heavens and the earth, and begged for help.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
The gods and humans that were watching screamed out,
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Gilgamesh
“Take a look at that driving technique!? Who would have thought the Boat of Heaven could be used for drift racing!”
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
“No one can catch up to that! Surely her driving mastery will go down in legend as the Drunk and the Divine: Underworld Drift! No one in Uruk could ever be faster!”
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I hate to admit it, but even I thought so too! Ishtar had been hiding her true colors up until then!

[charaFace D 1]

In the end, the Boat of Heaven had engine trouble and stalled just before the harbor in Uruk. Tragedy was averted in the nick of time.

As you can see, this is the story of Ishtar, a goddess who coveted everything she saw. On the other hand, [charaFace D 0]Ereshkigal did not desire anything.

...When the underworld was created, she was sent to become its ruler and foundation.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Someone had to maintain the underworld, and Ereshkigal was unlucky enough to have that responsibility thrust onto her.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Ereshkigal had only just been born when she was cast into the underworld and became the mistress of the depths of the earth.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
She managed the spirits of the dead for tens of thousands of years without being able to spend a moment on the surface or in the heavens.

In exchange, Ereshkigal became invincible in the underworld.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Even the gods cannot go against her laws in the underworld. Just ask that tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny girl over there.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
But outside the underworld, her special privilege disappears. She's about mid-level in terms of divinity, I'd say.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Also, if she's up against someone who's alive, then she has to kill them first, or the laws of the underworld won't go into effect.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

So the only ones that aren't affected by Ereshkigal's laws are [%1] and Mash.

My only concern was that [%1] might get killed by the gallû spirits the moment [&he:she] entered the underworld.

＠Gilgamesh
But it seems that Ishtar prevented that. She dropped to the underworld with you and protected you when you were most vulnerable...

Did you get a bit less dumb? Maybe your negative qualities like debauchery and stinginess canceled each other out and made a positive?
