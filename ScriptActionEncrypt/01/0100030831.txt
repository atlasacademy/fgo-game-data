Should we go after him, Darling?[sr]I'm sure we could[line2]

We can't!

＠Artemis
...Why not?
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

Because right now,[sr]both you and I are Servants.

Hmph. So you think that I'd lose, Darling?

＠Orion
That's a Lancer.[sr]On top of that, if he's Hektor then he's also, you know...
[k]

＠Orion
The great hero of the Trojan War. The greatest conflict[sr]in which the gods of Olympus intervened.
[k]

＠Orion
Even the omnipotent, invincible hero Achilles[sr]took many years to defeat him.

[charaFace G 5]

If you were in your "true body" sure,[sr]but with my power as your base it's a bit much.

Hmph. Surprisingly calm.

Not really. Everybody's mad right now.[sr]One of us has to be calm, or it's hopeless.

Oh, you're so cool![sr]Darling! Embrace me! Do what you want with me!

Blackbeard's subordinates... vanished.

They were created by Blackbeard's magical energy.[sr]Now that the Holy Grail is gone, they can't be maintained.

...Even though he himself still looks full of energy.

Hurry up and begone, Blackbeard.[sr]It must be hard for you to even breathe right now.

Damn you. You're being nice to me...[sr]Makes my heart flutter.

[charaFace E 3]
＠Blackbeard
I'd say, "Marry me, I'll make you happy"...[sr]I mean, you've been single ever since you were born, no?

＠Drake
I've had enough of you nitwit![sr]Hurry up and kick the bucket!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Blackbeard
Hahaha, what a nice insult!
[k]

＠Blackbeard
Now that I'm satisfied, it's time to die![sr]But this time I won't be beheaded.
[k]

＠Blackbeard
Because I am the greatest pirate after all![sr]I am a merry pirate, and I will die as one!
[k]

＠Blackbeard
I regret that I wasn't able to create my harem,[sr]but I still had fun. I approve!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Blackbeard
...Oh, old hag.[sr]Don't you need a story route where I revive as a rival?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Blackbeard
Wouldn't it be great if I revived with a line like[sr]"It's been decided, I'm the one who defeats you!" or something?

...Not needed, useless.[sr]Come on, snuff it.

Mash told me about your final moments.[sr]Make sure to take that head with you!

Okay, well that's all fine![sr]Hah, that's all dandy and fine! Fandy and dine!

＠Blackbeard
The woman who Blackbeard respected most![sr]The pirate who he yearned for most!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Blackbeard
She is present at Blackbeard's deathbed,[sr]and he keeps his head intact!
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Blackbeard
Then, farewell humanity![sr]Farewell pirates!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Blackbeard
And so Blackbeard draws his last breath! Haha![sr]Ahahahaha!
