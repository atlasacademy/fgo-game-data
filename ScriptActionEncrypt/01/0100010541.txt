You're the enemy of the world, aren't you? So first[line 2][sr]We must appease the souls of all those you murdered.

Go after them.[sr]Surely you can catch them on your "horse."

There's no need to fight.
[k]

Just tell me where they are, and I'll crush them.

It will be fine.[sr]Rider's Noble Phantasm is perfect for destroying them.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
...But you're right, I should be careful.[sr]I'll return and prepare to summon additional Servants.

Go ahead and cause as much trouble as you like.[sr]If you're lucky enough to find them, slay them.

You're right. There's no point in me worrying[sr]about your sense of inferiority towards her.

It's hard not to feel pity. The Queen they respected, who sent them a dress, is now her enemy.

But that is the fate of a Servant.[sr]That is the nature of the Holy Grail War.

Lancer, let's go.[sr]We must search the next city.

We are vampires, who must drink the blood of the living.[sr]Finding our next meal is a matter of life and death.
