That's Tiamat...? Really?

So beautiful... and melancholy... She doesn't seem anything like the Mother of Demonic Beasts...

＠Ishtar
Y-yes... I've never seen her before myself, but... Those big horns symbolize land, and her eyes reflect the stars of the inner sea...
[k]

＠Ishtar
That is the Goddess of Creation, Tiamat.[sr]No doubt about it.
[k]

[charaFace D 8]
＠Ishtar
Her womb was the soil of life itself, then it was cast away after fulfilling its purpose of creation.
[k]

＠Ishtar
In myths, they say she was killed by the gods, but in reality things were slightly different.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Ishtar
She was abandoned. She was abandoned by the entire world, by all the children she brought forth.
[k]

＠Ishtar
After the planet's environment settled and life was established, she was deemed unnecessary and exiled.
[k]

＠Ishtar
She wasn't sent to the old world that lies underneath, but to the Reverse Side. The lifeless World of the Void.

＠Quetzalcoatl
...Right. For the primates who gained the phylogenetic tree, she was too dangerous because she had the potential to create another world entirely.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
The fear was the foundation built with great pains would get mixed with the next world's foundation.

＠Ishtar
So they sealed her off. Infinitely. And now, she has returned.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Whether the Mage King pulled her out of the World of the Void, or if it was humanity itself that called her forth...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Ishtar
In either case, she should no longer belong on this planet.
[k]

＠Ishtar
We need her to enter a deep slumber once more. We need her to, but...

She just woke up... No, that's not it. Is this why the Laḫmu brought her the Holy Grail?
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
It doesn't look like she's noticed us, so maybe we can just take her down while she's bound?

I have visual confirmation of Tiamat here, too! This is your chance. Her limbs are still immobile!

She's completely sealed! Only her torso and head are free!

She's putting out as much energy as a hydrogen bomb! If she fires, Uruk will get blasted even from that distance!
