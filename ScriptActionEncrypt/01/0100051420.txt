＠Dr. Roman
No. He's a little problematic, but he's probably got a different grasp of the word “domination.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Citizens coming together as one to overcome hardship. Perhaps he thinks of that as “domination.”

It wasn't domination for one's own vanity, but a call to action done for the sake of this nation.

＠Scáthach
Interesting. I heard he was an inventor, but it seems he had political potential as well.

Still, those soldiers were unsatisfactory. They weren't trained at all. That's beyond foolish!

...Yeah. By simplifying the thought process, he's trying to improve their reflexes.

Edison doesn't have the time to raise soldiers, or should I say warriors.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's why he came up with a way for anyone to easily become a soldier.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's a doctrine of mass production and united thoughts...[sr]The exact opposite of the Celts.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That said, their opponents are heroes of legend.[sr]If this was a modern war, Edison would likely win, but...

Don't misunderstand. We're not going to take him down, we're going to treat him.

Although, I can't deny that the treatment procedure may be violent, even quite painful[line 2]
[k]

＠Nightingale
But in the end, that's still treatment.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
I got it, just don't shoot a gun near my ear again!

I'll take it into consideration. Anyway, we should head to Edison's stronghold[line 2]but first...
