What a drag. I've detected it, too.[sr]Having good hearing isn't always a good thing.

Of course. I became a Servant because of my music.[sr]I can detect any sound wave in the air.

＠Amadeus
For instance, the sound of you and Maria's sleeping[sr]when we were camping. I enjoyed listening to them both.

[charaFace F 1]
＠Amadeus
But, not just the sound of you sleeping. I've recorded[sr]all the tiny sounds your body makes in my Wolfgang Recorder!

What are you saying?[sr]Human beings create filth just by living!

Only by realizing that can you create true music.[sr]Life is filth, and music cleanses it.
