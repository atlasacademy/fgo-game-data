But[line 3]The staff left at Chaldea can only do their best[sr]because you're doing your best.
[k]

＠Mash
When Chaldea was bombed, you were the one who got[sr]the power back up in the fire, saved the survivors, and took command.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
You have only one fault.[sr]You give yourself just a bit too little credit.
[k]

＠Mash
Chaldea is only here because of Romani Archaman.[sr]You saved the lives of everyone here.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
That's what I think.
[k]

？1：She's right.

？2：You said "what you were thinking."

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Thanks, Mash, [%1].[sr]Then, I don't have time to be depressed. Yeah.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
We know who's behind this all now.[sr]There must be some reason for his extreme strength.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Let's continue the mission. We'll fix the remaining[sr]Singularities and stop the world and future from incineration.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...No matter what that man,[sr]Mage King Solomon, tries to do.

The Grand Caster.[sr]He is our true enemy[line 3]

...We've reached our rooms.[sr]Senpai, thanks for your endless work.
[k]

？1：You too, Mash.

＠Mash
No. I'm a Demi-Servant.[sr]Physically, I'm fine.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
If you can call exhaustion and drained magical energy...[sr]tired... then maybe I am tired.
[k]

？2：It's fine. I'm not that tired.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Um... I'm sorry.[sr]I meant that more as an idiom.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
And I do think you're tired.[sr]Get some rest in your room.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...Um. I'm sorry. There was something[sr]I had to talk to you about.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...What did you think about what Solomon said?[sr]About making use of humanity.
[k]

？1：It's stupid.

＠Mash
I...[sr]I couldn't say that he was wrong.
[k]

＠Mash
I don't understand it myself.[sr]But there was something in his words I can't ignore...
[k]

＠Mash
Life is meaningless, and the future holds no salvation...[sr]It sounds so pessimistic, but he was full of hope.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...I'm sorry.[sr]The battle just got started, and I'm being weird.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Good night, Master.[sr]I hope I see you bright and full of energy tomorrow.
