...How unfortunate. I cannot see the king even in a time like this?

Naturally. It is merely the escape of some refugees.[sr]We can handle it ourselves.

Or, Sir Gawain, are you saying you wish to trouble our king?

It is by the order of the king that the Holy Selection take place. Death awaits any failure, Knight of the Round or otherwise.

There is no need to wait for the king's verdict.[sr]Agravain, may I cast judgement on Sir Gawain myself?

Hey, that's harsh. House arrest should be punishment enough for him. No need to cut his freaking head off, right?

Half a year has passed since your rule began.[sr]Our Holy City is more prosperous than ever.

＠Agravain
Markets are full of bustling voices, wheat grows thick, flowing waterways glimmer, and flowers bloom in the gardens.

＠Agravain
The sky is perfectly clear and blue, and the desolate winds of famine cannot reach our lands.

We know that everything... everything is all thanks to our king's rule.

＠Gawain
Two were secured and given a warm welcome as citizens of the Holy City.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Gawain
However... The remaining one was lost.[sr]This was due to my negligence in supervision.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Gawain
I also allowed the refugees to resist, losing 12 Enforcement Knights in the process. The enclosure was broken and over 100 refugees fled.

They split up. One group headed to the mountains.

Sir Bedivere. We still don't know your reasons, but the situation is clear.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]

＠Dr. Roman
The Holy City is occupied by the Knights of the Round Table, Heroic Spirits of the 5th century related to King Arthur.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Those that gathered at the Round Table would naturally become the greatest force in this era. Unfortunately, this time, as tyrants.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And you, Sir Bedivere, are one of them.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Normally, you'd be a Heroic Spirit that sides with them, and yet you decided to save Mash.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
...Someone helped [%1] break the lines of those knights.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
That was you, right? You concealed yourself and blended in with the refugees...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Most likely to enter the Holy City without anyone's notice.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But upon seeing [%1] do battle with the knights, instead of slipping into the city amid the chaos, you joined in.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm sure it wasn't your intent to clash with Gawain there. But you saved us.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You're a hero. And not just that... You're a true hero of justice.

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah. A shining achievement atop the legend of King Arthur. The proudest and most powerful knights gathered at that table.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Why would they do such a thing[line 3]
[k]

？1：It's just like Ozymandias said.
？2：They must have a reason...

？！

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...Hmm. This is just my speculation, but...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Originally, the Sixth Singularity would have seen the Crusaders overrun the Holy City, resulting in an endless crusade.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...A never-ending war for the Holy Land that would lead to the collapse of humanity.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
The Crusader army, transformed into a Demon God, would end up doing battle with Chaldea... Or rather, [%1].
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But, as you can see, the Crusaders were defeated before we even arrived...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
At the hands of King Arthur, striving to defend humanity.

As a result, the Singularity was never repaired.[sr]In fact, the distortion grew even stronger.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...The reason being that King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table built their Holy City and took control of this era.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They make no effort to save this land as it burns away; they only seek to enrich their own city.

[k]

＠Bedivere
However, Servants are mere shadows of their souls. They should not exist on this earth forever.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Heroic Spirits should only exist temporarily.[sr]The earth is for those living in the present.

The wise King Arthur should be fully aware of this...
