Oh, are you awake already? I expected nothing less from a Servant. You're as tough as a Demonic Beast.

＠Ushiwakamaru
Still, what a horrific sight. If this is your home base, I suppose you've taken me prisoner because you plan to do... THAT to me?

I'm glad you're quick to understand.[sr]As you can see, this is a factory of sorts.
[k]

＠Kingu
Tiamat's Demonic Beasts are all created from one maternal body. But that alone has its limits.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Kingu
So, if it's greater numbers and a wider variety of species we desire, what we truly need is a larger “womb.”
[k]

＠Kingu
This temple was created for that purpose.
[k]

[charaFace F 7]
＠Kingu
One piece of flesh creates about three Uridimmus. On the other hand, three pieces of flesh only yield a single Ugallu.

In the end, they weren't even soldiers.[sr]For you, they're nothing but expendable tools.

Oh, sorry. My hand slipped a bit, and I seem to have spilled some of your guts. But you're all right, aren't you?
[k]

＠Kingu
Yes, yes. Both of us were a bit too careless.
[k]

＠Kingu
Me, my hands that move so easily. You, that cheeky mouth of yours. You should watch that.

Though, soon enough, you will be just like them.

Once we plant an egg in that stomach, you will begin to change, however slowly.

Every single one of them must have fought to the very end, even after the transformation was complete. All you did was give them strength to fight.

Those that become materials melt away from the extremities. In the end, their limbs end up like maggots.
[k]

＠Kingu
And after you turn into nothing more than slimy goo, you are tossed into each Demonic Beast's adjustment tank.

You can resist all you want. Fantasize about it to your heart's content. We'll let you dream that much.

I only kill threats. I kill human soldiers because they could potentially be threats against me.

The young ones... The children will not be threats.[sr]So, there is no need to kill them here.

[charaFace E 1]
＠Ushiwakamaru
How strange from the enemy of humanity. Trying to act like a demon, yet unable to embrace complete cruelty.

＠Ushiwakamaru
You know what folk like that are called?[sr]Clowns. They are ridiculed on the battlefield as such.

The true Authority of Tiamat is the “sea of life.” Those that fall into that sea become Tiamat's child as they are.
[k]

＠Kingu
Servants are no exception. Frankly put, it's a kind of black mud that corrupts any Spirit Origins.

＠Kingu
Primordial life. The sea of chaos. In the world of magecraft, it is called the mud of the Holy Grail.

＠Kingu
The King of Mages named this the Chaos Tide.
