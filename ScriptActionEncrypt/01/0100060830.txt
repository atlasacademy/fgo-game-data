＠Refugee Man
Just a little further. We'll be in the mountains soon.
[k]

＠Refugee Man
Once we're in the mountains, we can make our way to the village while staying out of sight.
[k]

＠Refugee Man
The eastern village is hidden, sheltered by the mountains. You can't reach it easily without a guide.
[k]

＠Refugee Man
It would be all the more difficult for knights from the plains. Especially when there are wild beasts and thieves up there.
[k]

？1：Sounds like we'll make it.
？2：Just a little further...

？！

Leonardo? No, wait. [bgm BGM_EVENT_3 0.1]Magical energy signatures are closing in quickly from the rear!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I detect four... They're Enforcement Knights! The quickest we've seen so far!

＠Da Vinci
Yup, they must be vanguard units on horseback. Fast horses at that. Anyway, look just a little further behind them, Romani.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
See that massive response? It's most likely a Knight of the Round Table.

Damn it, and you're so close! Anyway, you have to intercept them, [%1]!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Enforcement Knights will reach the rear of the refugee group in a few minutes! Hurry over there!

？1：Got it!
