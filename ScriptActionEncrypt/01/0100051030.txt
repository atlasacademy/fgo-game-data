Hey, Geronimo.

What?

I'm an American, so it's fine, but... You're a proud Apache, right?

Is it really okay? Saving this nation, I mean.

＠Geronimo
You're still saying that? If this nation isn't saved, we won't be saved, either.

...Besides, the idea of America owing me a debt is pleasant.

Even if all is lost and forgotten once the world corrects itself.

There's no need for you to feel any sort of guilt.

This truth is evident from my being summoned as a youth. Back during this time, all I felt for Sita was love.
