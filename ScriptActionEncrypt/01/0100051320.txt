[line 2]Yes, that's right. Oh, needless to say, I'm different from the other Celtic Servants.
[k]

＠Scáthach
...Perhaps it's because I am a special being beyond human, that Grail cannot rule over me.
[k]

＠Scáthach
The reason I materialized as a Heroic Spirit is a special one, too. All of humanity was incinerated, as was my realm.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Scáthach
And so, being “dead,” I was summoned here. In a proper version of history, I wouldn't even be able to talk to the living.
[k]

From that perspective, I'm glad about the current incident in a way, but... No, there's nothing to be glad about.

My student was already foolish enough, but now I see him in an even more unsightly, idiotic form.

I came here to put a collar on him and take him back, but it seems there's something on his mind as well.

That is the Cú Chulainn I know,[sr]and at the same time he isn't.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Scáthach
It's likely because of Medb's wish upon the Grail. She wanted the fool to become a wicked king rivaling herself.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Scáthach
As a result, a cursed warrior with nothing but the power to become a king was born.

Considering overall damage, Queen Medb has priority.[sr]The Holy Grail must be taken from that woman.
