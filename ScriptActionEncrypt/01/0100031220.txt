＠David
Anyway, back to our discussion.
[k]

＠David
The "Ark" is a third-rate Noble Phantasm. If you make[sr]someone touch the box, they die[line 2]That's it.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠David
Could it be used for evil? ...Yeah, probably.[sr]Strictly speaking, it doesn't belong to me.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠David
It's like a contract that God gave to humanity.[sr]It's not easy to steal, but it's bad news if stolen.
[k]

＠David
What's more, you can't shift it into spirit form.
[k]

＠David
I'm the Servant summoned to this world[sr]along with the actual physical "Ark."
[k]

＠David
Even if I die,[sr]it will remain as long as someone possesses it.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
It is said that inside the box lies the stone tablets[sr]engraved with the Ten Commandments...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠David
But that's not all.[sr]That thing brings literal "death," not just metaphorical.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠David
Anyway... After I heard from Atalante that Jason was[sr]after the "Ark"...
[k]

＠David
I hid in the forest with her, and waited for an opportunity.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠David
We waited for properly summoned Servants,[sr]like you.

＠Atalante
I was summoned as part of the Argonaut crew,[sr]but I didn't lose control of myself like Heracles.
[k]

＠Atalante
Maybe because I never liked Jason in life, or because[sr]I was summoned as an Archer who can act freely.
[k]

＠Atalante
Either way, once summoned,[sr]Jason immediately sought the "Ark."
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Atalante
He kept saying that if he had it,[sr]he could be the king of these seas.
[k]

＠Mash
Is the "Ark" a representation of kingship?
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.1]
[charaFace F 5]
[charaFadein F 0.1 0]
＠David
Hardly. It's just a relic[sr]I offered to God when I was a king.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠David
It's not a sign of kingship.[sr]It's simply something owned by a king.

＠Euryale
...David, may I ask something?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠David
Of course.[sr]Ask me anything.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Euryale
If I were to be sacrificed to this "Ark,"[sr]what would happen?
[k]

＠Euryale
If nothing else,[sr]that seems to be their goal...
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠David
Euryale, right? You were originally a Divine Spirit.[sr]If you were sacrificed to the "Ark"[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠David
Yeah, this whole era would "die."
[k]

[charaSet H 98003003 1 "Dr. Roman"]
＠Dr. Roman
Sigh. I thought so.
