I'm off to settle the score with the "Dragon Witch."

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Master, we'll head out there too.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
We should leave this place to the other Servants, and track the "Dragon Witch!"

Fafnir has fallen.[sr]Without it, the other wyverns...

I'm aware.[sr]Let us summon a new Servant.

Gilles, defend me while I focus on the summoning.[sr]I'm counting on you.

[charaFace F 0]
＠Gilles
Understood. I'll use my Noble Phantasm, Prelati's Spellbook, to buy us time.
[k]

Use that time to summon us a powerful Servant.
