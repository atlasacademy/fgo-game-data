＠Merlin
...So that's what's going on. The Altria in that Singularity is turning into something quite concerning...
[k]

＠Merlin
The Wild Hunt, one from local folklores. The King of the Storm and the King of the Dead leading them to manifest in this world.
[k]

＠Merlin
Of course, that's merely one of the stories attributed to her later on. There are other people fit to be the Wild Hunt.
[k]

＠Merlin
However, that Altria is different. She really became the Wild Hunt.
[k]

＠Merlin
To be precise, that's not the real King Arthur.
[k]

＠Merlin
She's the King Arthur that mutated due to a certain discrepancy.
[k]

＠Merlin
In other words, she's a fake King Arthur who should've never appeared. However, she manifested due to the influence of this Singularity.
[k]

＠Merlin
...Or perhaps, that is the real King Arthur, and the one from our memories is the fake one.
[k]

＠Merlin
The king who stayed behind on this earth to lead the dead. Or the once and future king who was transported to Avalon.
[k]

＠Merlin
Of course I know the one who went to Avalon. But the King Arthur you know is...
[k]

＠Lucius
...the one who stayed behind on this earth. However, I couldn't find what I was looking for.
[k]

＠Lucius
I never found what I was looking for. In the end, I ended up a living corpse washed up to this place.
[k]

＠Merlin
Precisely. You are truly fortunate. No, perhaps unfortunate.
[k]

＠Merlin
There was a rumor among the fairies of a human-shaped rock at the edge of Avalon.
[k]

＠Merlin
It appeared out of nowhere, and no one knows where it came from. It seemed to be a human, and scarily enough, it was still alive.
[k]

＠Merlin
It was alive yet it couldn't move. The body was beat-up and its soul exhausted. Truly, a living corpse.
[k]

＠Merlin
But surprisingly its mind was still intact.
[k]

＠Merlin
That rock had tremendous tenacity. It wouldn't allow itself to die.
[k]

＠Merlin
...I am sure you understand by now. That rock was you, Lucius.
[k]

＠Merlin
You showed up here due to the effects of the Singularity. A possibility that came from another terminal world.
[k]

＠Merlin
Lucius... No, my dear friend Sir Bedivere. Good morning, and good day.
[k]

＠Merlin
I'm sorry to do this to you right after you woke up, but there's no time to spare. I'm going to request something cruel from you, as always.
[k]

＠Merlin
Can you still fight? Can you still complete your mission?
[k]

＠Lucius
...Of course. I've done everything I have up until now for that purpose.
[k]

＠Merlin
I see. ...I see. Then I shall give you this parting gift.
[k]

＠Merlin
First, I shall cast a spell upon you to deceive others into not knowing your true identity.
[k]

＠Merlin
Even a Heroic Spirit won't be able to discover your true self.
[k]

＠Merlin
Why? Because if they knew who you were, they would try their hardest to stop you.
[k]

＠Merlin
They're not stupid. Well, I suppose Mordred is. If they know the truth about you, they'll awake to the truth about the Lion King too.
[k]

＠Merlin
They will definitely not let you get close to the Lion King, and the Lion King doesn't remember you any longer, I imagine.
[k]

＠Merlin
You must get an audience with the Lion King and complete your task before you are denied.
[k]

＠Merlin
It's a very, very lonely journey. But you're used to that, right?
[k]

＠Merlin
You've continued your journey long enough to make one lose their sanity.
[k]

＠Merlin
But let's be perfectly clear, okay? Regardless of the result of this upcoming battle, you will die.
[k]

＠Merlin
Your soul exhausted, ousted from the cycle of reincarnation, your existence will fall into the void.
[k]

＠Merlin
Even then[line 3] do you still strive for the end of your journey?
[k]

＠Lucius
...Yes. My mind... My will... They remain loyal to my king and his glory.
[k]

＠Merlin
...I see. Then this is an additional parting gift for you. I've made it so that you can fight.
[k]

＠Merlin
I've changed its name to Airgetlám. You will exhaust your soul as its fuel each time you use it, but try to endure it.
[k]

＠Merlin
The place you will travel to is a hypothetical. A place standing at the edge of the world where chivalry is striving to be perfected.
[k]

＠Merlin
You shall fight your former allies. You shall face the sin you've committed.
[k]

＠Merlin
Even so, the light in that hand shall never dwindle.
[k]

＠Merlin
Why, you ask? Because it itself... is the greatest sin you have committed.
