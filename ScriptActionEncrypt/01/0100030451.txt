Do whatever you want with me![sr]Just hurry up!

＠F：???
Asterios is near death.[sr]He wouldn't be much use to you.

[charaFace F 2]
＠F：???
Besides, if we take too long, he'll die[sr]and then the labyrinth will collapse on you.

[charaFace F 3]

Wait, you chased after me not even knowing that?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Euryale
Obviously, you wouldn't have anything like me,[sr]a full super idol, on board your ship.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

You should at least remember my name, sheesh.[sr]Where are you from anyway, third-rate pirate?

Y-You little brat!

？1：I want to clear something up.

Huh? What?[sr]Wait... Why, you're a human.

[charaFace F 0]

Hm? Hmmm? Are you the Master of "that thing?"[sr]What brings you here?
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Euryale
No, before all else, if you're the Master[sr]you must discipline your Servants!
[k]

＠Euryale
What's with that perverted Servant anyway?[sr]You can't find something that disgusting, even in Greece!

Look who's talking!

You trapped us inside a Bounded Field. Wouldn't it[sr]be natural for us to assume you're our enemy?

...Pardon me. We were a bit shaken up as well.[sr]Asterios over there is the one who put up the Bounded Field?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Euryale
That's right. But it wasn't to trap you guys in.[sr]It was to prevent the enemies outside from entering.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I see. But, unless you remove this field,[sr]we'll be stuck in here...

It's a simple numbers game.
[k]

＠Euryale
There are only two ways out of here.[sr]Either Asterios dies, or we remove the field.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Euryale
In that case, I'd rather remove the field.[sr]...It's much better than being alone.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
...I see. Yes, I like you.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
But, you're so cornered that you had to[sr]put up this "Bounded Field" thing, right?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Euryale
[line 2]It has nothing to do with you.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
It does![sr]See, I love interesting things.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Euryale
...Huh?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
A trip around the world. Adventure. Dungeons. Monsters.[sr]This world has so many interesting things to offer!
[k]

＠Drake
Interesting things tend to be more valuable.[sr]That's how this world works.[sr]That's why I became a pirate. But that's that.
[k]

＠Drake
Anyway, you smell like money.[sr]That's why I'm bringing you aboard my ship.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Euryale
H-Hey! You can't just decide that on your own![sr]Board your ship? You must be insane!
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Euryale
I already decided![sr]I'm not leaving Asterios behind!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

Who said anything like that?[sr]Asterios over there is coming with us, too.

So much guts and power...[sr]And, quite a hunk if you look at him long enough!

＠Drake
I'd be the laughingstock of pirates if I let this talent slip[sr]by! Hey, would you like to be a bodyguard on my ship?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
If you refuse, there's nothing I can do. Hey you, will[sr]you die unless you're cooped up inside a labyrinth?
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Euryale
Th-That's not really the case.[sr]...Are you sure?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Of course I am. I'll pay you well, too.[sr]Oh, but don't expect any benefits from us.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Euryale
That's not the issue.[sr]I mean... As long as you are okay with it.

If...you...go...me...follow.[sr]Alone...lonely.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Euryale
I see. Very well, then...[sr]We'll board your ship.
[k]

＠Euryale
Ah! But I'll need you to prepare my own room.[sr]I have no intent of showing my face to common pirates.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

Of course, your ship has a bath, right?[sr]Oh, and also[line 2]
