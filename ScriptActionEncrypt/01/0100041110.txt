＠Mordred
...Under Londinium, huh?
[k]

＠Mordred
I knew there was a subway underground, but who'd[sr]have thought there'd be something "under" that.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mordred
And how dense this Demonic Fog is...[sr]Isn't it getting thicker the lower we go?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm not sure. I can't observe from here,[sr]but if it's getting dense enough to visually confirm...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Then maybe what Babbage said was true.[sr]After all, there really was a path leading below.
[k]

？1：Why is this here in London?

？2：Was this made by the Mage's Association?

？！

＠Mash
London has had an underground transportation network[sr]since the middle of the 19th century.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
But there are no records of underground passages like[sr]this. ...Perhaps the remnant of a national top secret project?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Mage's Association only excavated the area[sr]right under the British Museum...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Hard to think an individual secretly built an underground[sr]labyrinth, so maybe this existed before London took shape?

＠Mordred
There's this old story.[sr]Deep underneath the Tower of London[line 3]
[k]

＠Mordred
The head of an ancient king of Britain named Bran is[sr]buried, and it watches over Londinium.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
A head, huh...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
Interesting story, huh?[sr]The Tower of London has other stories, like the crows.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Oh, I know a bit about that one.[sr]They watch over London[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
They're said to be the avatar of my father, King Arthur.[sr]I mean they're crows! His avatars are crows! Ha ha!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
What? I think crows are really cool.[sr]Raven Master is really cool, right Mash?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Uhh... What do you think, Senpai?
[k]

？1：What? You're going to ask me?

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
...
[k]

？2：Pretty cool.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Right. I think so too, Senpai.
[k]

？3：Not really cool.

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
That's...true. No, I, well...
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
Setting crows aside, you can't track[sr]this underground passageway or routes from your end?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Sorry, just as Mash mentioned earlier,[sr]there are no records. You'll have to explore on your own.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Hopefully it's not too complicated...[sr]But it already sounds like a labyrinth.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Deep underneath London... An unknown[sr]underground passage, underground labyrinth.
[k]

＠Mash
If what Mr. Babbage said was correct,[sr]then a "large-scaled machine" should exist.
[k]

？1：The Massive Steam Engine?

？2：The source of Demonic Fog?

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Yes, the source of the Demonic Fog filling London.[sr]The Massive Steam Engine Angrboda, powered by a Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's what he mentioned right before vanishing.[sr]To think a Holy Grail would be integrated into a machine...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But, that makes some sense. The existence of a fog[sr]abnormally full of magical energy, and its proliferation.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A strange situation that throws off a Servant's detection[sr]ability, and prevents various observations from Chaldea.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I see, by using the power of the Holy Grail,[sr]something like that would be possible.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
That may also explain the mechanism[sr]that materializes Servants from the Demonic Fog.
[k]

＠Mash
By incorporating the Holy Grail into a device,[sr]the Demonic Fog gained the ability to summon Heroic Spirits.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Such speculation is also possible.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
But Angrboda, huh?[sr]That's a grand old name.
[k]

？1：Angrboda?

？2：The one from Norse mythology.

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Right, Angrboda is a Divinity from Norse mythology.[sr]They brought forth Fenrir, World Serpent, and the Goddess of Death among others.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
With Loki, right?[sr]An unbelievable woman giant, but I don't hate her.
[k]

＠Mordred
It's not often that you see someone[sr]give birth to so many troublesome beings[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mordred
Definitely worth punching. I'm sure she has thick skin[sr]too, so I can get down and hack her into pieces, right?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
(Oh, that's what you meant by "don't hate her"...)
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
(It's been so hard to retort to all this...[sr]I'm sure Mordred is saying everything on purpose)
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
(Y-Yes. I believe Mordred's mother was...)
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
(Yeah. A witch among witches. None other than Morgan!)
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mordred
[line 3]Looks like they're finally here.[sr]Hostiles.

Beat me to it again. Detecting multiple targets![sr]Looks like there aren't any more Helter Skelters.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Quality aside, they're coming in large quantities![sr]Be careful!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
Roger that.[sr]Master, starting combat!
