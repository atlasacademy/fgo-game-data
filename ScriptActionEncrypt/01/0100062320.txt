＠Bedivere
Still, the layout of this place is rather complicated.[sr]It's more of a maze than an academic institute.
[k]

＠Bedivere
The path splits in two as we descend, but if you look behind you, it's actually three.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Bedivere
It's built like an optical illusion.[sr]It's as though...

＠Holmes
Indeed. It's built to confuse those trying to leave. Entering is simple, but exiting is forbidden.

It's not like it's to protect against theft... That would be the opposite, right? So why did build it this way?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Holmes
Because they were more fearful of people leaving than entering.

＠Holmes
The Atlas Institute was a group of geniuses. They immersed themselves in various research, in their own independent workshops.
[k]

＠Holmes
There were no taboos here. One would not be rebuked for creating any weapon, no matter how inhumane.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
However, there was one condition: what was created here could never be brought outside.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
That was the great principle of the Atlas Institute.[sr]For over 2,000 years, they stubbornly kept to this rule.
[k]

＠Holmes
An exception would be the Seven Contracts created when the institute was established.
[k]

＠Holmes
The Atlas Institute promised to cooperate with only those holding these special contracts.
[k]

＠Holmes
I'm sure this agreement caused headaches for generations of directors. They're contracts arbitrarily made by their ancestors, after all.
[k]

＠Holmes
They had recovered four of the contracts by 2000 AD, but the whereabouts of the other three remain unknown.

Oh, sorry to stop so abruptly, but there are more defense mechanisms! I expect you can handle them?
