＠Alliance Soldier
Climb! The sandstorm won't last forever! Let's get a ladder and get up on that wall now!

＠Holy City Soldier
Remain calm! It's not possible for them to reach the top of the wall! We will pick them off one by one!
[k]

＠Holy City Soldier
We must not open the gate without the Lion King's orders! Peasants like them are not worthy to look upon the Holy City!

We are still at a disadvantage! Our ladders get destroyed the instant they mount on the wall...

The sphinxes are attacking the main gate but there's not even a scratch! What should we do?

Camelot Castle will only grant access to those with righteous hearts... Malicious attacks alone will not bring down the gate!

No! We've all made it this far... But arrows from above the wall and the Enforcement Knights are taking us out one by one...

＠Da Vinci
Lord Hassan is facing off with Sir Gawain. This is probably our once-in-a-lifetime chance!

＠Da Vinci
We've got no choice... Sir Bedivere! Can you do something about the gate with your Airgetlám!?

I am too embarrassed to say... This is the most terrible shame of my life!

＠Bedivere
My Airgetlám has no effect on Camelot. I cannot raise a sword against it no matter what!
