We've covered about 10 kilometers so far...[sr]Master, just hang on for a little bit longer.

O-Or would you like me to carry you?[sr]If you ride on my shield, then I can just pull it...
[k]

？1：...No, it's just that...
？2：...For some reason, I can't breathe...

...Just as I thought, the mana density in the atmosphere is too high. Here, [%1], take this.

A portable oxygen canister?[sr]When did you...

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
It's a mana-blocking mask I made in a hurry.[sr]The atmosphere here is too harsh for humans.

＠Da Vinci
Hey, that's what I'm here for. Still, a little “thank you” would be nice. Come on, shower me with your admiration!

＠Da Vinci
Either way, we'll be at the water source soon.[sr]You can see that building beyond the sandstorm, right?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That must be a temple. If we can at least get in there[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_11 0.7] then we should be able to[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Da Vinci
Sorry. Forget everything I just said, this place is no good. We have to turn back.

Why!? We're so close!

＠Da Vinci
That we are. But I can see countless shadows in the area between here and the temple. Look closely.

You're right. They're all wandering around... I wonder what they are?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
They're the same kind of sphinxes we encountered earlier. They're roaming around the temple freely.

It's suicidal to pass through here.[sr]Let's find a different shelter.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
By the way, I got a pretty good idea who's residing in that temple.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We can't enter on our own.[sr]So let's look for another route.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Hey, if need be, I'll even supply my universal secret cottage like you might see in games, so rest easy.[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 1.0][sr]It's comfortable up to three uses, so[line 3] Huh?
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
...[bgm BGM_EVENT_3 0.1]I think I just saw some shadows heading this way from the temple... Sphinxes?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
All right, let's make a run for it! I thought I glimpsed a skull mask as well, but whatever!

...Huh? For sphinxes, their magical energy level is too low... And this number... Humans?

[line 3]Hmph, they caught on pretty fast! Sending soldiers after us, eh... How clever of you, Sun King.
[k]

＠???
Those monsters won't dare to hurt us as long as we have the queen, but the humans are different. She has no influence over them.
[k]

＠???
There's no time, get rid of them! But let one of them live! It will be a valuable source of intel!

One of them is carrying a bound woman![sr]Senpai, your orders!

...Right! Please leave it to me, Master!
