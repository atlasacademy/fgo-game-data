Why were you Master candidates summoned to Chaldea? This will explain that.

＠Olga Marie
Listen up. Today of all days, we at Chaldea will achieve something that will be written in history.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The science of learning. The invention of religion.[sr]The acquisition of navigation. The focus of communication. The voyage into space.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Our legacy will be on par with the "Pioneers of the Stars." No, it will surpass them.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Rather than expanding civilization, we will be the hands of God protecting it.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Stabilizing human history, we will transform the future into a solid resolution.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The principles of mankind[line 3][sr]in other words, to ensure the continuation of humanity.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That is Chaldea's, and now your only and absolute purpose.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Chaldea has achieved many results to date.[sr]The development of observation cyber daemon, Laplace.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The Global Environment Model, Chaldeas.[sr]Completion of the Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The Heroic Spirit Summoning System, Fate, and the launch of the Spiritron Calculation Engine, Trismegistus.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
With these technologies, we at Chaldea have observed humanity's progress one hundred years into the future.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
We do not predict the future, but observe it. Like many who observed celestial bodies, Chaldea has been observing the future.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Whatever it sees, our job has been to ensure that humanity will survive 100 years into the future.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Look up. That is Chaldea's proudest achievement[line 3]
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Created with advanced magical theories, the Global Environmental Model, our Chaldeas.
[k]

[charaFadeout E 1]
[scene 10210 1.5]
＠Olga Marie
Planets have been defined as beings with souls.[sr]We copied them into this miniature Earth.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Because of the difference in scale, we are unable to read each single human mind.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
But whatever's on the surface, the city lights that can be seen on land, can be observed through Sheba.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Currently, it's been set to reflect the Earth one hundred years from now. Chaldeas may very well be the future of Earth itself.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
As long as the light of civilization shines within Chaldeas, we can guarantee humans will exist a century further.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
As long as there's light people will live in cities, and serve as proof of civilization's survival.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
But[line 3] Lev, could you normalize Sheba's polarization angle?

＠Olga Marie
This is the current state. Starting six months ago, Chaldeas changed color, and it's become difficult to observe the future.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The light of civilization, our beacon till now, has become largely unobservable to us.

＠Olga Marie
Hmph, the right response.[sr]Good to see you've got some sense.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Olga Marie
That's right. The lack of light means that civilization has become extinct.
[k]

[seStop ad3 3]
＠Olga Marie
This was considered highly classified, but you have the right to know.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Our observations indicate that the light of humanity is only visible up to the year 2018[line 3]
[k]

＠Olga Marie
In other words, we've observed, no, proved[sr]that humanity will become extinct in that year.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Obviously, this future is not possible.[sr]It cannot happen, and physically speaking, is impossible.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
There's neither an economic collapse nor some sudden[sr]seismic event. We can't explain how humanity would suddenly just disappear.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Over the past six months, we've found the cause of this strange phenomenon[line 3]the disappearance of the future.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
If the reason is not in the present, then it is in the past.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Using Laplace and the Trismegistus, we've reviewed all data for the past 2000 years.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
We tried to find something that didn't exist in history, or was on Earth until this point in time.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
As a result, we finally found something new.[sr]It's this[line 3]
[k]

[messageOff]
[scene 10204 1.5]
[wait scene]
[wt 0.5]
＠Olga Marie
Spatial Singularity F, a city in the Japanese countryside in 2004.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
We discovered an "unobservable zone" that did not exist in history up to the year 2017.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Chaldea hypothesizes that this is the cause for[sr]humanity's extinction. We proposed the Rayshift experiment to the U.N. and received approval.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The Rayshift process transforms a human into spiritrons, sending them into the past and allowing them to alter it.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Simply put, it's time travel. But not everyone can do it.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Only people with exceptional magical circuits, and the ability to become a Master, can be transformed.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Olga Marie
Now[line 3] I'm sure that cleared things up.[sr]Your task is the investigation of Singularity F.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Olga Marie
You'll travel 14 years into the past, find Singularity F, and destroy it.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
We are now entering unknown territory.[sr]There's no telling what you might find there.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
But you've been selected from among people all over the world. You can do this, and we have high expectations for you.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The higher-ups want to know the cause of this[sr]immediately. We don't have time to waste.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
We'll be performing the first Rayshift experiment in an[sr]hour. I'm sure you've all had enough training.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
For the first experiment we'll send Team A, the top 8 scorers, to Singularity F.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
I haven't told the later groups, but they're Master candidates who have been chosen from Chaldea.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Team A has been active for a month now.[sr]You can call them trained warriors.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Team A will go on ahead and establish a base camp at Singularity F, guaranteeing your safety.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Teams B and below will monitor their situation and prepare for the next experiment.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Let's register your information with the Klein Coffins, the arks that will send you to the past as spiritrons.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
There's one for each person, and there are no spares.[sr]Be very careful with them.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Teams B through D will be on standby, in case of trouble with Team A.

＠Olga Marie
[line 3]What are you doing?[sr]I told you what you have to do.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Olga Marie
You were brought here as a potential Master.[sr]You're practically a soldier now.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
You will obey orders and be ready for a fight.[sr]Do not make me repeat myself.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Olga Marie
Or do you have more questions?[sr]Hey you, the one who was late!
[k]

＠Olga Marie
You look confused.[sr]I'll give you the chance to ask one question.
[k]

？1：Is time travel possible?

？2：Is it safe to change the past?

？！

[charaFace E 3]
＠Olga Marie
...[sr]Does the word "Singularity" mean nothing to you?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Olga Marie
The singularity we found doesn't exist in any of our observation records.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
It's like a hole that just appeared out of nowhere.[sr]The hole itself is cut off from the proper temporal axis.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
The 2004 singularity exists apart from the past and[sr]future. There's no need to connect it to our present.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
It's more stable than regular time travel, and whatever happens the timeline can still repair itself.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Singularity F is like a tiny stain on the dress that is human history.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
It ruins beauty just by its presence.[sr]Your job is to extract it.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That's what will return humanity to its proper, observed course of history.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Olga Marie
...What is the Association thinking, sending me someone who doesn't know basic spacetime theory?
