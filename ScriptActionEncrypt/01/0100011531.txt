[charaFace A 8]

No, I was just thinking of Gilles de Rais.
[k]

＠Mash
I knew his history, or so I thought.[sr]His heart was broken by Jeanne's death...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
In our history, he became a murderer who killed hundreds of children.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
...That bloody France was what he wanted.[sr]It was an appropriate sight for a murderer.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
But still, even then[line 2][sr]His real wish was for Jeanne d'Arc to live.
[k]

＠Mash
That was the source of his rage, and his hatred.[sr]A pure rage that could destroy a country[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Raw feelings are powerful, aren't they?[sr]They can destroy the world[line 2]
[k]

？1：He was human, after all.

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
...Because he was human.[sr]Amadeus said something similar, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...I don't have the experience they do. I don't have[sr]those deep feelings, or a heart that can handle them.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
But I'd like to learn them if I could.[sr]Even if I don't understand, I can learn a little at a time.
[k]

＠Mash
I think that's what Amadeus was talking about.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I'll see you tomorrow.[sr]Good night.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
