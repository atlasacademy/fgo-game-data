I see. That's what she said when she stayed behind?[sr]Oh well, it can't be helped.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Amadeus
You don't have to feel bad. Even if we were there,[sr]she would've done the same thing.

Maria is an eternal philanthropist.[sr]That's how she lives and dies.

It's all right, I knew this was going to happen.[sr]Remember how Maria was talking about the piano?
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Amadeus
See, that was her way of saying goodbye.[sr]It never happened when we were alive.
[k]

＠Amadeus
If she'd said to me "Let me hear your piano,"[sr]I couldn't have stopped her.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

But, the second farewell hits hard. Worse than[sr]the first. All the more as we'll never meet again.

Eh... Um, if you are Heroic Spirits, wouldn't there be a chance to see each other again?

Mm, that won't happen, I think?[sr]There are as many Heroic Spirits as the stars.

＠Amadeus
How I came across her this time was already a miracle.[sr]Though, a whimsical Master might change things a bit.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]

Anyway, I'm a bit tired. I'm going to excuse myself,[sr]call for me when you're ready to leave.

By the way, Master.

？！

[charaFace G 0]
＠Kiyohime
Of course you. Though temporary, can you enter a contract with me?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Kiyohime
Yes, sticking out your pinky is enough.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
This is a pinky promise, if you lie, I'll make you swallow a thousand needles...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Kiyohime
This completes the contract! Just so you know... I really will make you swallow a thousand needles if you lie.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

Is that clear?[sr]Please take care of me from now on.

No, Master... The more correct way to put it is,[sr]I appreciate all your efforts from the bottom of my heart.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Siegfried
I shall entrust my sword to you.[sr]This body will be my Master's sword and shield.

My True Name is Siegfried. I have no other skill than[sr]slaying dragons, but I'd be honored to be put to use.
