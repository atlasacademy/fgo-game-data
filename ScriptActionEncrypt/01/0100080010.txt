＠Marisbury
Wonderfully done, Caster.[sr]We have eliminated all six of the other Masters.
[k]

＠Marisbury
We have won the Holy Grail War. Once I use my Command Spell to make you kill yourself, the ceremony will be complete.
[k]

＠Marisbury
The Greater Grail will be filled with the souls of seven Servants, and the Magical Reactor Core used to reach the Root will activate.
[k]

＠Marisbury
And then, the Third Magic shall finally take form.
[k]

＠Marisbury
The Third Magic is the materialization of souls.
[k]

＠Marisbury
Humanity shall escape the shackle of the physical body, be released from all suffering caused by its “limitations,” and advance to a new stage.
[k]

＠Marisbury
You are a sacrifice for that purpose.[sr]I am sure you understand, Caster.
[k]

[charaTalk on]
[charaTalk A]

＠
I[charaTalk A] nodded in agreement. Humanity's salvation and growth were not the tasks given to me.
[k]

＠
If[charaTalk A] the humans of that era wanted to grow,[sr]I had no reason to stop them. Just as it was during my life, I simply did what was required of me.
[k]

＠
In[charaTalk A] the Fuyuki Holy Grail War, there would be no Servant survivors.
[k]

＠
All[charaTalk A] Servants were to be eliminated. Even I, the victor, was fated to commit suicide, compelled by my Master's Command Spell.
[k]

[charaTalk off]

＠Marisbury
...No, that was a joke. I'm kidding, Caster.[wt 0.3][sr]I'm sorry. I got overexcited.
[k]

＠Marisbury
I have no intention of offering my meritorious partner to the Greater Grail. I won't use my Command Spells, either. They wouldn't work on you anyway.
[k]

＠Marisbury
Do you understand? I will not activate the Greater Grail. The Third Magic means nothing to me.
[k]

＠Marisbury
As the head of the Animusphere family and chairman of the Astromancy division... I must reach the Root in my own unique way.
[k]

＠Marisbury
It's preposterous to ask me to rely on other mages' theories. The miracle proposed by the Einzbern family...
[k]

＠Marisbury
...The materialization of souls and the growth of humanity... I have no intention of being part of such fantasies.
[k]

[charaTalk on]
[charaTalk A]

＠
That[charaTalk A] was an unexpected development.
[k]

＠
Marisbury[charaTalk A] didn't realize it, but that was the first and last time he would ever tell a joke.
[k]

＠
What surprised me most, though...[charaTalk A] was how much his thoughts deviated from what I myself had seen.
[k]

＠
I[charaTalk A] asked him: “Then, what do you desire?”
[k]

[charaTalk off]


＠Marisbury
I'm only after the Grail's ability to grant wishes, and my wish is clear.
[k]

＠Marisbury
It's the completion of Chaldeas.[sr]Truth is, the one at Chaldea is still just a prototype.
[k]

＠Marisbury
It was built to satisfy the sponsors. Sure it functions as an Earth model, but it's far from being complete.
[k]

＠Marisbury
It's just like this Greater Grail, Caster. The theory is complete, but the all-important fuel to power it is lacking.
[k]

＠Marisbury
The Greater Grail requires the souls of Heroic Spirits, but my Chaldeas needs something more...realistic.
[k]

＠Marisbury
To power Chaldeas, I would need to take over power plants that could generate enough electricity for an entire country. For no less than six months, even.
[k]

＠Marisbury
Essentially, I need a budget that could fund an entire nation. But the only assets I have...
[k]

＠Marisbury
...are my precious Offshore Oil Rig, Seraphix, and a French nuclear reactor I managed to buy the other day.
[k]

＠Marisbury
That's not nearly enough.[sr]Simply put, I need more funds.
[k]

＠Marisbury
...That's fine. Laugh at my absurdity and shallowness if you so wish.
[k]

＠Marisbury
Despite the divine greatness that is the Greater Grail,[sr]I seek from it neither eternal life, nor the Root itself.
[k]

＠Marisbury
What I want is a giant pile of money!
[k]

[charaTalk on]
[charaTalk A]


＠
Marisbury[charaTalk A] told me to laugh, but there was nothing funny about it.
[k]

＠
Creating a miracle[charaTalk A] was his life's work. It wasn't something he could get someone or something else to do for him.
[k]

＠
Instead, [charaTalk A]he asked for the time it would take to complete his task to be shortened. Probably because he didn't have much longer left to live.
[k]

＠
He determined that[charaTalk A], in the ten years he had left, there was no way for him to complete and activate Chaldeas.
[k]

＠
And so,[charaTalk A] to hasten its activation, he joined the Fuyuki Holy Grail War. The war was, to him, a shortcut.
[k]

＠
It would allow him to obtain the necessary resources without becoming indebted to rival families, or having to worry about financing and its inherent complications.
[k]

＠
He'd[charaTalk A] leave no traces. Nobody would be able to see what was coming.
[k]

[charaTalk off]

＠Marisbury
...Thank you, Caster.[sr]I knew you would understand.
[k]

＠Marisbury
Your cooperation will allow us to keep this ending our little secret.
[k]

＠Marisbury
We can let the world think that Saber and their Master won the Fuyuki Holy Grail War.
[k]

＠Marisbury
...Only a coward would cover this up. But if I don't, the other Lords will be able to get in my way.
[k]

＠Marisbury
No matter what it costs, I will complete the true Chaldeas and activate it. It will be necessary in order to secure humanity's future.
[k]

＠Marisbury
By doing so, Professor Lev's Sheba will not only be able to see the future, but the light of the past as well.
[k]

＠Marisbury
And pseudo-Spiritron projection[line 2]the Rayshift theory[line 2]will no longer be just a theory.
[k]

＠Marisbury
Why did the Age of Gods come to an end? Why has the Foundation of Humanity remained unstable since advent of the Anno Domini era?
[k]

＠Marisbury
Once the Rayshift works, we'll be able to answer those questions.
[k]

[charaTalk on]
[charaTalk A]

＠
I[charaTalk A] knew this man was dangerous in a way unique to mages. Simply put, he lacked the sense of morality.
[k]

＠
But,[charaTalk A] his burning passion and love for humanity were unwavering.
[k]

＠
I[charaTalk A] signaled my consent.
[k]

＠
This[charaTalk A] Greater Grail was not to be used to reach the Root, but to grant one man's wish.
[k]

[charaTalk off]

＠Marisbury
To grant one's desire...
[k]

＠Marisbury
Yes, how ironic. The end result is turning out to be just the kind of nonsense the original ritual's creators promised.
[k]

[charaTalk on]
[charaTalk A]

＠
I[charaTalk A] laughed in agreement, but only because I could tell that Marisbury's smile wasn't entirely genuine.
[k]

[charaTalk off]

＠Marisbury
What about you, Caster?
[k]


[charaTalk on]
[charaTalk A]

＠
[charaTalk A]...?
[k]

[charaTalk off]


＠Marisbury
Hey, don't tell me you forgot what the Einzberns said!
[k]

＠Marisbury
The Holy Grail will grant the victor's wish. Both the Master and the Servant have the right to ask for a wish.
[k]

＠Marisbury
I wish for immense wealth. But what about you?[sr]What will you wish for?
[k]

＠Marisbury
You can't change the past, but you can change how it is viewed today. Or would you like to be incarnated and live a second life?
[k]

[charaTalk on]
[charaTalk A]

＠
I froze[charaTalk A]. I never expected this question.[sr]My wish. My wish. My wish...
[k]

＠
I'd never[charaTalk A] had the freedom to ask for one.[sr]So, I was about to say I didn't have one...

＠Marisbury
Come now, Caster. ...No. Solomon, King of Mages.[sr]My contractor. My one and only friend.

“Why do you fight? Why, knowing your life will someday end, knowing it's ended already?”

“Why do you cling to life? Why, when you realize that there's nothing in your future you can save?”

What you've just told me... That is your answer?

...A shame. Truly, a shame. Only those directly involved could be satisfied by such an answer.

There is no path to a longer life for you.[sr]You have rejected eternity, and so you shall die.

So die like the trash you are, and take all of Chaldea with you.

Die as one who clung to life. As a brave warrior who overcame many trials and perils.

[k]

＠Da Vinci
This Singularity is its own little world.[sr]It's a conceptual universe.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If Chaldeas is a miniature model of Earth, then the enemy territory is a miniature model of the universe.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Well, it's a universe with no other celestial bodies. On a human scale, it would be about the size of a single cell.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
What's interesting is that there's only a single life form in this universe. But, we can ignore that for now.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

＠Da Vinci
There's an incalculable amount of magical energy swirling around the center of the Singularity. That's definitely the King of Mages' throne.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The throne will be your target. But the route connecting to it is currently blocked.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That is to say, the temple gate is shut.[sr]Well, it's natural to protect one's seat of power.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]

＠Da Vinci
So, first you're going to destroy all the surrounding areas in the enemy's territory.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The enemy territory itself is actually a single massive life-form. It's sending energy from the outer edges to the core.
[k]

If you destroy them, or shut them down, the path to the throne should open.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Then, you defeat the King of Mages once he's exposed, and finally come back to Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

＠Da Vinci
You'll have to walk back, though.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Traveling via Rayshift can only be done along the contact point... the entrance into the enemy territory.
