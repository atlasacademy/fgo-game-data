＠Mash
Master...[sr]I'm sure Blackbeard said "Hektor."
[k]

＠Mash
If that's the case, then that spear is the sword "Durandal," later inherited by Roland, one of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne.
[k]

＠Mash
Or rather, the base for that sword.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
It's a miracle that Asterios didn't die.[sr]That's how powerful that spear was.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But I wonder what Hektor plans to do,[sr]with Euryale.

＠Mash
Yes. From the start, Servant Hektor[sr]had his eye on Mistah Blackbeard's Holy Grail.
[k]

？1：Blackbeard seemed wary of that.

？2：Mash, why "Mistah"...

？！

＠Orion
I can understand the Holy Grail,[sr]but why Euryale?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's not about bolstering forces.[sr]Euryale herself isn't that powerful of a Servant.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I think what makes her special[sr]is the fact that she IS a Servant.

What? What do you mean?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Actually, in the past, we met "another" her...[sr]No, maybe her... Big sister, perhaps?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Anyway, we met a girl summoned as a Servant[sr]despite being a goddess.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Euryale is not a hero,[sr]nor is she someone whose name is engraved into history.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
She was treated as a goddess in Greek mythology.[sr]"The one who flies far"[line 2]that is Euryale.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Or she was a monster.[sr]The middle sister of[line 2]the three Gorgons.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The youngest is the famous Medusa,[sr]I can see her being summoned into a Holy Grail War.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But, not Euryale. She is just a goddess,[sr]an idol of ideals, and undoubtedly weak.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
For her to be summoned as a Servant[sr]is a strange phenomenon.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Though some other Servants are just as peculiar.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Usually it's hard for Divine Spirits to become Servants.[sr]Unless there is a really special case.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In addition, a pure god becoming a Servant[sr]is something that isn't supposed to happen in the world of Magecraft.

Basically what you're saying is, Euryale isn't good[sr]enough to be kidnapped for her fighting prowess?

Well, that's not a reason for us not to save her.[sr]Plus, she's a great singer.

I like great singers.[sr]It is a very important role for sailors, right men?

？2：Is something the matter?

？！

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...No. Captain Drake's personality is just very complicated.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...It's hard to explain, but she reminds me of you.[sr]Facing difficulties. Helping those around her.
[k]

＠Mash
It is an advantage, a merit, that humans possess.[sr]But why[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Is Francis Drake a villain?[sr]As she is now, and back in history.
[k]

＠Mash
She is such a good person, but her actions are[sr]that of an outlaw.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
I can't understand this contradiction well[line 3]
