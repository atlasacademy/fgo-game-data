Although it has nothing to do with me,[sr]but it's true that I did know you.

You were endlessly innocent.[sr]Like a child excited over receiving a paltry treasure.

You were hopelessly cruel, and completely innocent.[sr]Despite being weak, you attracted others and inspired loyalty.

But you were quick to betray everything.[sr]That's the only way you knew how to live.

[charaFace D 0]

[charaFace A 7]

[k]

[charaFace D 1]

It's fine. You needn't state the obvious.[sr]I know how it ends for me. I die, right?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
Life is interesting once you know you're going to die.[sr]No, because you will die, you want to live in the moment.
[k]

＠Drake
I'm not really a fiend for treasure.[sr]What I want is money, and pleasure.
[k]

＠Drake
We're gonna die eventually! So I want to enjoy every single moment while I can.

Thanks to you, I now know how vast the world is.[sr]It's a never-ending journey, even if I go all out.

[charaFace D 0]

I'd be satisfied to take just a little of that,[sr]and blaze one of the many trails available.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
With my pride on the line, I'll take care of that somehow.[sr]As for magical energy, I might know someone who can help.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Really? I thought chances for outside help were nonexistent?

＠Dr. Roman
Huh? Oh yeah, sorry. I had the wrong idea.[sr]I'll get by somehow with Da Vinci's stash.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Anyway, you two need to unwind. Next up is[sr]the fourth Singularity[line 3]the turnaround point.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
France, Rome, and the sea. Each time, the[sr]number of irregularities has been increasing.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Maybe with the next Singularity,[sr]the real target will come.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
That's why I want you to rest up.[sr]We've got some time until the next Rayshift.
[k]

＠Fou
Fooou!

Good job, Senpai.[sr]You did your best too, Fou.

＠Mash
...By the way, Senpai.[sr]Did you want to sail around the world with Drake?
[k]

？1：A little.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Me too.
[k]

＠Mash
The captain was larger than life,[sr]but overflowed with charm.
[k]

？2：Let's go after this is over.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
After our battle is over?
[k]

＠Mash
...Yes.[sr]Not a trip via Rayshift, but a journey in this era.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I want to enjoy a world in which the future[sr]isn't decided yet, just like Captain Drake.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Senpai. I think this recent search for the Holy Grail[sr]was the most special case so far.
[k]

＠Mash
The process solely was to head somewhere.[sr]It was a battle on a seemingly endless sea.
[k]

＠Mash
Along the way, I think I learned something.
[k]

＠Mash
Good and bad people alike contribute to human history.[sr]Human diversity and contradictions. Expectations, too.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Humans are brutal creatures. They use wisdom[sr]and gain power for their own desires and objectives.
[k]

＠Mash
That is a truly brutal trait. You could say that they are[sr]the most powerful and barbaric organisms on the planet.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
But there's hope in that brutality... The hope of[sr]realizing what couldn't be realized.
[k]

＠Mash
The power not to let the impossible remain impossible.[sr]This power, this hope, she taught us that is what makes us human.
[k]

＠Mash
...I don't know if I have such a power.[sr]But, I'd like to get as close as I can.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
So I can keep fighting by your side, Senpai.[sr]To become a Servant that you can be proud of someday.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Now, then, Senpai, Fou, sweet dreams.[sr]We're on dry land for the first time in a long while.
[k]

＠Mash
We don't have to worry about getting seasick anymore.[sr]Please have nice and long rest.
