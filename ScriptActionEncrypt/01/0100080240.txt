Oh dear. Turning a blind eye to one's immaturity is unsightly. It has nothing to do with the Command Terminal, or whatever that is.

Kiyohime will go to the ends of the Earth and the universe if it's for my dear Master. Such a deed is only proper to demonstrate a pure maiden's love.

Yes, truly unsightly. Blaming your superiors for your own inadequacy... You need to rebuild yourselves from the ground up.

First of all, having 71 backup dancers looking like you is unthinkable. That's so out of touch!
