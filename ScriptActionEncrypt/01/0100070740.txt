[%1], then.

＠Ishtar
Very well. Since you were foolish enough to tell me your names, I will answer what I can.
[k]

[effect bit_talk_40 0,-400]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Ishtar
To address your first question. The reason why we, the Three Goddess Alliance, attack Uruk. This goes without saying, but we wish to control the world.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Well, technically, I want to rule humans, and the goddess of the north wants to rule the world... There's a slight difference.
[k]

＠Ishtar
And the goddess of the south... Hmm... I'm not sure about her. She's from a different culture, so I don't know what's up with her.
[k]

＠Ishtar
In any event, we're in competition with each other...
[k]

＠Ishtar
To see who can destroy Uruk first and obtain the Holy Grail in King Gilgamesh's keeping.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The first goddess to obtain it will control the land.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The other two will either leave, or remain to serve as subservient deities.
[k]

＠Ishtar
That is the goal of the Three Goddess Alliance. Simple, right?
[k]

？1：Tell us the other goddesses' True Names.

？！

[charaFace F 8]
＠Ishtar
I cannot tell you that. The Three Goddess Alliance has a pact that prohibits us from attacking each other.
[k]

＠Ishtar
This pact is sacred, and cannot be violated. Exposing the True Names of the other two goddesses would be tantamount to an attack.
[k]

[charaFace F 7]
＠Ishtar
You and [%1] wouldn't expose the secrets of your good friends, would you?
[k]

＠Ishtar
A goddess gossiping about someone behind their back would be disgracing herself, you know.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I will not divulge the True Names of the other two goddesses, even under threat of death. Understood?
[k]

[k]

？！

[charaFace F 7]
＠Ishtar
And to answer your question about who summoned us...
[k]

＠Ishtar
I was summoned by the Sacred Temple in Uruk. But the goddesses of the north and south are different.
[k]

[charaFace F 8]
＠Ishtar
Those two were drawn here by the Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I'm not sure whether that was the Mage King's plan or not.
