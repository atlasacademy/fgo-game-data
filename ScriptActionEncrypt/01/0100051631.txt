Hm, not bad for a practice round.

I didn't think I would be nearly killed in a warm-up...

[charaFace C 1]
＠Scáthach
Oh, nonsense.[sr]All right then, [charaFace C 0]Rama, you lead the charge.

＠Scáthach
I'll be acting on my own and monitoring the actions of Queen Medb and Cú Chulainn. If needed, I'll fight and hold them down.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Rama
Isn't that like walking to your own death!?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Scáthach
Certainly, if I was some other Servant.[sr]But, who do you think I am?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Scáthach
Do I look like someone who'd be gobbled up that easily? Even if they got me, it'd take days.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Rama
...Still, you already say it like it's inevitable...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Scáthach
Well. That can't be helped. There must be some sacrifices. After all, someone's got to do it.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Scáthach
Listen. If those two ever make it to the front lines, we will most certainly lose.
[k]

＠Scáthach
I am something like a dam to hold them back.[sr]It's on you all to lead this battle to victory.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Scáthach
I am counting on you, Rama. You're still inexperienced, but you have the skill to be a swordsman comparable to my stupid student.
[k]

＠Scáthach
You have experience leading battles, too. You're essential in our army.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Rama
...There's no stopping you after such a speech. In life, my army was mostly monkeys... But, well, it'll work out.

[charaFace C 0]
＠Scáthach
You've got plenty of Servants now.[sr]You have nothing to fear, even if I alone am missing.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Scáthach
Ideally, I would've liked to enjoy the life of a normal Servant, but asking for luxuries can be endless.

Farewell!

Master, a word?
[k]

[charaTalk A]
＠Mash
Karna. What is it?
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Karna
I'd like to stand out as much as possible in the vanguard... Will you allow it?
[k]

？1：Why?
？2：I guess...
？！

＠Karna
[line 2]Arjuna is on the other side.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Karna
By nature, he shouldn't be on that side.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Karna
A born hero, Kiritin... Arjuna is the very embodiment of justice, a true Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Karna
In addition, he and I are connected to each other... For better or for worse.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Karna
The key to this battle lies in how we immobilize enemy Servants.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Karna
In which case, I'll concentrate on shutting down Arjuna with everything I've got... Would that be all right?
[k]

？1：Please, Karna.

[charaFace E 5]
＠Karna
Very well. I'll make sure to shut Arjuna down.
[k]

？2：Do your best.

[charaFace E 5]
＠Karna
Of course I will.[sr]I will not go easy on him.
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 0]
＠Karna
I will take the vanguard soldiers, then.[sr]Let's go[charaFace E 2]!

You have good reason to be, Mash.[sr]After all, Cú Chulainn is on their side.
[k]

＠Rama
The strongest soldier, who singlehandedly fought his way through Medb's army.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Rama
As long as he is against us,[sr]there will be no such thing as a sure victory for us.
[k]

＠Rama
I need not mention Edison and his North Army.[sr]We, too, may very well collapse on the battlefield.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Rama
Nevertheless, to make victory ours...[sr]We will give it our all.

Understood![sr]All units attack! This is the final battle!

Take back the United States of America for yourselves![sr]We will lend our assistance as well!
