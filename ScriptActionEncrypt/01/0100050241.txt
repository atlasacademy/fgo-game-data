Oh unknown Shielder Servant.[sr]This Holy Grail War is by all means...a war.

As far as we're concerned, we only needed to keep you here.

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
Oh no![sr]The other soldiers!
[k]

＠Fionn
They're nameless warriors.[sr]Just unique monsters who will continue to fight.

＠Fionn
Of course, they're no match for Servants...[sr]But I wonder... [charaFace C 1]How about the American troops?

That's a beautiful gaze, full of sincerity. I shall forgive your transgression for showing me such a wonderful gaze.
