＠El-Melloi II
Looks like a Servant was summoned in the enemy[sr]vanguard. Was it that Court Mage's doing[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠El-Melloi II
No, it couldn't have been.[sr]In that case, was it you?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：???
I don't know.[sr]All I did was gallop my horse.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：???
I thought they'd be on their way by now.[sr]I never thought it would be this soon.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠El-Melloi II
Oh?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：???
Have you heard the rumors about the Mediterranean[sr]goddess? They say that aside from her, there are two female monsters.
[k]

＠F：???
So you see...[sr]It hit me.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：???
A Chained Summon.[sr]If such a thing could be possible.

[charaFace E 4]
＠El-Melloi II
I don't like battles that rely on luck.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：???
Please don't say that. You're the one[sr]who created that opening in their vanguard.
[k]

＠F：???
Let's get ready now, while he's buying us time.

...Are you sure?
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠F：???
About?

[charaFace E 4]
＠El-Melloi II
If he materialized through the chained summon,[sr]then most likely he's[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：???
Yes, I think he's Darius III.[sr]The fearless Persian King and my forever rival in life.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠F：???
However, right now, I feel that I know that as a kind of future.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：???
It's okay.[sr]I fought him once, and will fight him again.
[k]

＠F：???
And I want to fight him again.[sr]But not right now.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：???
Right now, it's Nero Claudius.[sr]I want to talk to that person.
