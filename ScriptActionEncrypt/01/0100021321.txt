＠Nero
...Mmm, so it's you.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Nero
Where's Mash? Oh, the restroom?[sr]I guess this happens too.
[k]

＠Nero
It's just you two seem to be joined at the hip, so I thought you'd be together during those times too, sorry.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
...
[k]

＠Nero
...I made a fool out of myself, didn't I?[sr]I can't believe I'd lose it like that.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Nero
Although I panicked a bit during the incidents with my uncle and Lord Caesar.
[k]

＠Nero
This time, it hit home.[sr]Just a tiny bit, mind you...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
I...
[k]

＠Nero
"Could it be?" I thought.[sr]Could it be that my path was mistaken?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
...Needless to say, that's not possible.[sr]I myself am Rome...its fifth emperor.
[k]

＠Nero
But when I heard our founding ruler's voice,[sr]though it was for a brief moment, it did cross my mind.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
"Could it be?"
[k]

＠Nero
The other day, I put up such an act, and now I'm being completely pathetic.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
But it crossed my mind.[sr]Could it be possible?
[k]

＠Nero
Would it be better for me to just bow down to the[sr]Holy Progenitor? No, let's say it. I will say it.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
I wanted to.[sr]That's how I really, truly felt in my heart!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
The Holy Progenitor![sr]With all of his faults, he founded this nation!
[k]

＠Nero
If my path is wrong, if that is indeed the case, then I want to entrust everything to him as an "emperor" of the United Empire!
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
But[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
I can't do that. That is the one thing I cannot do.[sr]The Holy Progenitor is definitely mistaken.
[k]

＠Nero
Look at his people, look at his soldiers.[sr]Not a single one of them is smiling!
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
No matter how perfect the reign may be, how can there be a nation without laughter!
[k]

＠Nero
Which is why[sr]I...I...
[k]

？1：You're not wrong. Stay on your path!

？2：We're in the middle of a battle right now.

？！

[charaFace D 3]
＠Nero
...I know.[sr]Oh, I know!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
That's it.[sr]I forgot something important.
[k]

＠Nero
No matter who the enemy might be, I must not stray[sr]from the path. I shall finish what I started.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Thank you, [%1].[sr]I feel like my eyes are wide open now.

＠Mash
I'm back, Senpai.[sr]...Oh, Nero?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Umu, hey there Mash![sr]If you're back, it's about time to finish this!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
???
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Looks like you've cheered up...[sr]Senpai, Nero looks brighter now, right?
[k]

？1：She's the same as usual.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yeah, that's true.[sr]That might just be true.
[k]

＠Mash
I think she's a lot like the sun.[sr]That's why she's captured the hearts of many.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Even now, people are fighting under her name.[sr]She's got a powerful charisma.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
That's just who she is...[sr]Even if it dims a little, her light still shines true.
[k]

？2：I cheered her up a little.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
All because of that?
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
I see...[sr]So that's what I should have done.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I couldn't do anything for her.[sr]Master, you're amazing.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Boo. What are you talking about?[sr]I want in on it too.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
At least that's what I want to say. Right now, I'll just[sr]have to wait, for now we assault the palace!
[k]

＠Nero
Jing Ke has found a way in. We will take a[sr]small number of elites, and take out Romulus.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
This will be the last battle. Will you come with me[sr]Mash, [%1]?
[k]

？1：Of course!

？2：We have unfinished business in there, too.

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Umu![sr]Let's go, then!
