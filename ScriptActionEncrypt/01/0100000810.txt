＠Olga Marie
Hey, [%1].[sr]It's pretty obvious that Kyrielight's looking depressed.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
You are her Master, aren't you?[sr]Do something to cheer her up!
[k]

？1：Mash, is something wrong?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
No! There's nothing different.[sr]I'm operating perfectly, Master!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
But that's the problem, nothing's different...
[k]

？2：Could it be...

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Yes. I'm ashamed to be the one to say this, but...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Um, under your command Senpai, I have gained enough experience...
[k]

＠Mash
And yet... I'm still unable to unleash my Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Mash
I don't even know how to unleash it...[sr]I'm like a defective Servant.

＠Dr. Roman
Oh, so that's what was bothering you.[sr]You have such a strong sense of responsibility, Mash...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
But I don't think that can be settled overnight.[sr]After all, it's a Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If a Heroic Spirit's secret weapon can be mastered within a day or two, then Servants wouldn't be that special anymore.

＠Caster
Of course we can master something like that[sr]immediately. After all, Heroic Spirits and Noble Phantasms are the same thing.
[k]

＠Caster
If the young lady here can fight as a Servant, that means at that very moment you can use your Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Caster
And yet you can't, which simply means your magical energy is not circulating right.
[k]

＠Caster
Let's see, maybe enthusiasm? No, perhaps too reserved?[sr]Anyway, I'm sure it's because you just don't yell out when you practice.
[k]

Hey, don't yell all of a sudden![sr]You're going to burst my eardrums, seriously!

Sorry Director.[sr]But Caster said we should shout...

No, that was a metaphor...[sr]Well, at any rate, I see you have enthusiasm.
[k]

＠Caster
[%1], you heard the young lady.[sr]Do you mind if we take a quick detour?
[k]

？1：Detour? What kind?

？2：Don't tease Mash. She's an innocent girl.

？！

＠Caster
What? I'm just talking about special training. It won't[sr]take long. I'm a Caster right now, so leave the healing to me.
[k]

＠Caster
First we'll start off small. Let me inscribe some[sr]misfortune-bringing runes... Okay, we're done.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Huh? What are you doing?[sr]Why are you inscribing runes on my coat?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Caster
Even if something targets you, you can take care of yourself, right? And look, here they come.

All right, that should be enough.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caster
To put it simply, a Noble Phantasm is part of a Heroic[sr]Spirit's instinct. It's hard to use it if you think too much.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Caster
Therefore, you must first use up all of your energy, young lady! Man, I'm a genius!
[k]

？1：That isn't a cure, that's an extreme measure!

？2：Maybe you're an idiot?

？！
