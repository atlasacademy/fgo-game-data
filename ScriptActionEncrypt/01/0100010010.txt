Let's get right to the briefing, then.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
For starters... Oh right,[sr]let me go over what I want you to do again.
[k]

[label la0010]
＠Dr. Roman
First, [FF0000]the investigation and correction of the singularities.[-][sr]It is humanity's critical turning point in that era.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
If it were not for that, we could never have come as far[sr]as we have. It is the pivotal "event" in human history.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You must travel to that era, investigate what it is,[sr]figure it out, and then correct it.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Otherwise, 2019 will never come.[sr]Humanity will be extinct in 2018.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
That is your first objective.[sr]The basic principle of the upcoming operation.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The operation's second objective is[sr][FF0000]Investigate the "Holy Grail."[-]
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
This is just my speculation, but the singularities must be related to the Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The "Holy Grail" is a relic that can grant wishes. A vessel that contains tremendous amounts of magical energy.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Lev probably got his hands on the Grail in some form, and misused its power.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Rather, it's impossible to travel through time[sr]and change the past without the Grail. Seriously.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
You will run into intel regarding the Grail during your investigation of the singularity.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Even if you correct history, leaving the Grail will put us back to square one.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You must either secure the Holy Grail, or destroy it.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Those are the two objectives of this operation.[sr]Is everything clear so far?
[k]

？1：Crystal clear.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Glad to hear it.
[k]

？2：Sorry, could you go over it again?

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
All right, fine.[sr]But pay attention this time, okay?
[k]
[branch la0010]

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
...And now, there's one other thing I want you to do in addition to the mission.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That said, it's nothing major.[sr]It's for after you Rayshift to that era.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I want you to find a leyline and make a summoning[sr]circle. Just like you did in Fuyuki.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Unlike Fuyuki, we could probably make do as-is if it's just telepathic communication...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
But to transport supplies, it won't work without establishing a summoning circle.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Just like before, once Mash sets up her Noble Phantasm it will act as a catalyst and trigger the summoning circle.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Once you do that, you can summon Servants at will.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Of course, what you summon will probably be Servants closely tied to that time and place.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So keep doing that to bolster your forces.[sr]Understood?

Sheesh. Standing there is Chaldea's pride and joy,[sr]the head of our Engineering Department, Leonardo.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As you can tell, they are quite unusual.[sr]Of course, not a human... Let's not get into that.

Right you are～♪ I'm Chaldea's honorary[sr]tech advisor, I normally go by Leonard here.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But as you can see, I am the proud inventor of the[sr]Renaissance! The one-and-only Leonardo da Vinci in the flesh!
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Da Vinci
You can just call me Da Vinci. You don't get to see[sr]many pretty ladies like myself around here right?
[k]

？1：Huh? Pretty lady?

？2：Da...Vinci?

？！

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
This is strange. It's abnormal. It's wrong![sr]I mean, Leonardo da Vinci should be a man[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
You should always question conventional wisdom.[sr]But, is it really that important?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
Who was the first one that claimed I was a[sr]man or a woman? Sheesh, for crying out loud.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
I pursue beauty with both my inventions and art.[sr]It was I who personified all ideals[line 3]all beauty.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
To me, the ideal beauty is the Mona Lisa. That being the case[line 3]See? Isn't this simply an unavoidable result?

I like to think of myself as a scholar, but this guy's pet theories go way over my head.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
He's the only pervert twisted enough to turn himself[sr]into the Mona Lisa, just because he loves the Mona Lisa.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Da Vinci
Heh heh. Are you sure about that, Dr. Roman?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Da Vinci
As cultures mature, anything is possible. The desire[sr]to become a beautiful girl might one day be the norm.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
That might be true, but which time period's Heroic Spirit are you?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
Genius has nothing to do with time period, Doctor.[sr][%1], you'd do well to remember that too.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You will encounter many Heroic Spirits who were artists.[sr]Every one of them is as splendid and eccentric!
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Dr. Roman
Are you kidding me?[sr]Still, I can see that being the case!

＠Mash
I see. It's true that I didn't want to know too much,[sr]but thank you for the advice, Da Vinci.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Da Vinci
That's my girl, you're always so understanding.[sr]Ok, that's enough for my introduction.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
From now, I will be focusing on supporting you with[sr]supplies, R&D within Chaldea, and updated Heroic Spirits' contracts.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I am a Servant summoned by Chaldea, you see.[sr]Unlike Mash, I cannot jump to any era.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Da Vinci
However, if [%1] has a contract with[sr]me, then it would be another matter.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I would then be able to aid you as an ordinary Servant.[sr]I'm looking forward to such a fate, Master.

[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
I'm sorry but we don't have time to rest.[sr]We're going to prep for immediate Rayshift, ok?
[k]

？1：Of course. I'm ready to go at any time.

？2：...Well, if I have to.

？！

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
[%1], we have a coffin ready for you this time.[sr]You should be able to Rayshift safely and quickly now.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Seven singularities have been detected, but we've[sr]selected the time period with the smallest fluctuations.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Once you get there, we'll only be able to communicate with you.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Got it? I know I'm repeating myself, but the first thing[sr]is to set up a base camp and finding a leyline.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
After you've settled into the era, do what needs to be[sr]done. All right[line 3]Good luck, [%1].
