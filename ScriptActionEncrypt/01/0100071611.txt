The Seven Evils of Humanity manifest and exist as Spirit Origins. They are seven disasters, created by humanity's bestial nature.

＠Dr. Roman
We're short on time, so I'll just get to the conclusion. They're made from what you'd call the base for the Mesopotamian world[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Sand and soil of the Age of Gods... The Mud of Gods. These beings don't exist in our genealogical tree.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Since there's no difference between males and females, we can assume they reproduce asexually instead of sexually.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
From their internal structure, it seems that they're currently in a larval state. Meaning they're going to change even more.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They emit so much magical energy because their Magical Circuits are those of beings from the Age of Gods. Think of them as mass-produced Enkidus.
[k]

So, I've named them Laḫmu. It was the name of Tiamat's first child, and means “mud.”

...They killed another one? Is that how they think observing humans is done?
[k]

＠Kingu
They don't know how to control themselves. They're lower than Demonic Beasts. They toy with and destroy them, and grin with those teeth...
[k]

＠Kingu
The noise they make is like human laughter. How crude. Why did Mother create such things...?

...Well, it doesn't matter. They're merely soldiers. I am all the world needs.

＠Kingu
I don't need companions, or family.[sr]...Not even friends.

For I am the one true and complete new man. But...

...It's no good. I can't hear Mother's voice.
[k]

＠Kingu
Before, I was able to hear her sobbing when I closed my eyes, but since the sea turned black, I can't hear anything...
[k]

＠Kingu
Then I will have to break the seal, just like Solomon said.
[k]

＠Kingu
...But... Who on Earth has the ability to bind the Primordial Mother?
