＠Caesar
Hmm, you certainly are strong.[sr]No[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Caesar
Who would even place a fine general like me on the front[sr]lines in the first place. Can't call this "best man for the job."
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mash
Wielding such a devastating sword...[sr]How can you even say that...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Just what you'd expect of a Saber Class...[sr]He's truly a skilled Servant.

＠Nero
Such a monster...[sr]Ugh, and I thought he was just a fake emperor...
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caesar
No, you're wrong about that Nero Claudius. I'm still[sr]the emperor, though no such title existed in my time.
[k]

＠Caesar
In response to your beauty and courage, I shall tell[sr]you my name. I am Caesar. In other words...
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Caesar
Gaius Julius Caesar.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
Wh-What? That's...[sr]the name of the ruler who preceded our first emperor...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
But... You're dead...[sr]How can this be?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caesar
You've already met Caligula, I presume?[sr]Then you should already know.
[k]

＠Caesar
We're "genuine."[sr]Both myself...and him.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
...Ugh.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Caesar
Try to relax. You are beautiful, truly beautiful.[sr]Your beauty can match any other treasure in the world.
[k]

＠Caesar
You, Demi-Servant, you too are beautiful.[sr]Very nice indeed. Nice body, too.

＠Caesar
I admire your courage, strength, and beauty.[sr]Therefore, I shall tell you one thing.
[k]

＠Caesar
The Holy Grail is located in a castle within the United[sr]Empire's capital. More precisely, in the hands of our Court Mage.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Mage[line 2][sr]Can you tell us the name of that person?
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Caesar
I can't. Your reward ends here for[sr]I have no reason to tell you more.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caesar
Now, Emperor Nero, your hardship is not something I wish for.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Caesar
But I have my own reasons to fight.[sr]I want that Holy Grail for myself as well.
[k]

＠Caesar
They say once a Servant has obtained the Holy Grail, they can get any wish granted[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Caesar
This is rather greedy as I am already dead, but I must fulfill the promise that I made.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Caesar
...Well then.[sr]It's time for me to be serious.

It's been a while, so I needed exercise.[sr]The poor golden sword also needs occasional use.

This presence[line 2][sr]Please be careful, Master!

＠Dr. Roman
His magical energy level is rising?[sr]No, he's unleashing what he's been holding back!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I guess our opponent has gotten serious![sr]Or rather, he didn't fight seriously until now!
