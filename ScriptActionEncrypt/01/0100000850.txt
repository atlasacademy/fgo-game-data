[line 3]Whew, I knew you'd survive that. But I never thought both you and your Master would walk out without a scratch.

Be happy, wait no...[sr]Praise her, [%1].
[k]

＠Caster
That young lady there is without question, a first-rate Heroic Spirit.

＠Mash
Senpai, I... just now!
[k]

？1：Right. Congratulations, Mash.

？2：Yeah. That was amazing, Mash.

＠Dr. Roman
That was surprising. I didn't expect her to unleash her[sr]Noble Phantasm that soon. Mash was never someone with a strong will...

That's because you got her all wrong.[sr]You may call the young lady here, a protector.

＠Caster
There's no point in teaching a bird to swim, is there?[sr]You have to teach a bird how to fly high.

Right. Even though I can unleash my Noble Phantasm[sr]now, I still don't know its True Name, nor the True Name of the Heroic Spirit...

＠Olga Marie
That's fine, even if you are inexperienced...[sr]Even if you are only temporary...
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Your very wish unleashed your Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
You didn't have the slightest desire to obtain a True Name, to become one of the chosen[line 3][sr]To become a true Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
That's why your Noble Phantasm responded.[sr]Ahhh, what an inspiring story. Just like a fairy tale.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Um, Director...
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Don't mind me, I'm just teasing. I'm pleased that[sr]you're able to use your Noble Phantasm now.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
But it's inconvenient to use it without a True Name, right? I'll think of a good spell for you.
[k]

＠Olga Marie
Since it's a pseudo-deployment of Noble Phantasm...[sr]Let me see... Yes, let's call it "Lord Chaldeas."
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Olga Marie
Chaldea is a name that has meaning for you too. So to[sr]activate your Spirit Origin, that's a good spell for you, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Y-Yes...[sr]Thank you, Director!

Lord Chaldeas... Yes, I like it.[sr]That fits you perfectly, Mash!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
And the desire to try it out after getting it is only human[sr]nature. Caster, would you be Mash's sparring partner?

＠Caster
Yes, of course. I was holding back before, but even so, her defense was impeccable.
[k]

＠Caster
As someone with more experience, I'll hammer the basics of Noble Phantasms into your head.[sr][%1], young lady, are you ready?
