There didn't seem to be any Servants among them.[sr]They were all human soldiers.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
No mages that could be Lev, huh?[sr]Anyway, good job. It's gotten really dark.

Let's head back, Senpai.[sr]If there's a night raid, we'll be in for another battle.

＠Mash
You should rest while you can.[sr]Didn't I tell you as much this morning?
[k]

？1：Yes, you did.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Okay.
[k]

？2：I'm not sleepy yet...

＠Dr. Roman
I have to check Magi☆Mari's blog too. She should've updated her diary by now...
[k]

？1：Doctor...

[communicationCharaFace 2]
＠Dr. Roman
Wh-Why are you looking at me like some sort of pitiful[sr]creature? What's wrong with internet idols?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
They're truly the ideal "idols," untainted by[sr]the hand of the media, TV networks, or even morals!
[k]

？2：Isn't the outside world destroyed?

＠Dr. Roman
You've noticed a vital point.[sr]The outside world has definitely been destroyed.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Which means Magi☆Mari and that HP will[sr]no longer be updated...Is that what you think?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Fool! Magi☆Mari is a supreme idol who[sr]has transcended beyond this world's circumstances!
[k]

...Well actually, she's been recreated as an auto-generated AI from her original data.

＠Mash
Doctor, it's not my place to comment on the hobby of a 30-year old bachelor, but please do your job.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mash
Otherwise, I'll be forced to delete that "secret" folder of yours.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
C-Come on now, it's a joke![sr]I'm always checking your surroundings and finding data!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Anyway, get some rest you two.[sr]The Emperor's also waiting for your report.
