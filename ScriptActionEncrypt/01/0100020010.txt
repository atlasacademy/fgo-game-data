＠Mash
Good morning.[sr]Did you sleep well, Senpai?
[k]

？1：Yes, like a log.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Glad to hear it.[sr]I'm happy to know that you got plenty of rest.
[k]

？2：Well enough.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Is that right?[sr]Senpai, you must rest as much as possible.
[k]

？！

＠Fou
Fou! Fou!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
As you can see, Fou is also fired up.[sr]I'm sure he's had more than enough sleep and breakfast.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
We don't know what it'll be like beyond the Rayshift.[sr]No telling when or how much we can rest.
[k]

＠Mash
So as much as possible, please get enough sleep.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Staying up late is prohibited, since your magical energy is linked to your stamina.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
And, umm[line 2][sr]about that dream...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Did you see something?
[k]

？1：Dream? Why?

？2：No, not really...

？！

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
It's not like I saw anything special.[sr]It's just...
[k]

＠Mash
Da Vinci says that Masters and Servants under contract see the same dream.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I don't know what that means...[sr]But if you didn't see one, then there's no problem.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Let's go to the command room after breakfast.[sr]The Doctor's eagerly waiting.

Yawn! Oh, 'morning... The tech department is[sr]analyzing the Grail you've retrieved as we speak.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
...That half-asleep genius, and myself.[sr]Please pardon the work crew for not being very reliable.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
We're already set to Rayshift.[sr]This time you're headed to 1st Century Europe.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Specifically Ancient Rome, the great empire that[sr]grew from Italy to control the Mediterranean Sea.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Da Vinci
Hm? Ancient Rome? Really?[sr]That sounds like fun! I sort of want to go, too!
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
You have analyzing to do, I believe.[sr]Please partake of Roman pleasures some other time.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
Oh, darn it. I don't care which one,[sr]but I always wanted to chat with a Roman Emperor.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
Especially Emperor Caligula or Nero.[sr]I bet we'd have a lot in common.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Yes, I feel the same... No, we can't.[sr]You also have work to do reviving Chaldea.

Ahem! Is that clear, [%1].[sr]Your teleport point is the Imperial Capital Rome.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
The name of the Roman Empire's capital is also Rome.[sr]It's geographically similar to the last time.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The exact location of the supposedly existing Holy Grail[sr]is unknown. There may be historical changes as well.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Neither can be determined.[sr]Sorry, the observation precision seems unstable.

Not a problem.[sr]Either way, Senpai and I will locate it.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Right, that's the spirit.[sr]You really are reliable.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Similar to the last mission, you'll reach and correct the[sr]singularity. Also, find the Grail, and either obtain or destroy it.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Humanity's continuation is on your shoulders.[sr]I hope you're successful this time, too.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
And...[sr]That you come back safely.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
[line 3]Yes.[sr]We'll make it back to Chaldea, I promise.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...I'm counting on you, Senpai.[sr]I'll need your strength for this mission.
[k]

？1：Leave it to me.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Okay!
[k]

？2：It's rather your strength we need, Mash.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
No, that's... The fact is, running this mission[sr]requires your judgment and leadership.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
No doubt, Servants will be summoned during the 1st Century Rome as well.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If possible, call upon their power.[sr]Of course, you won't get help from hostile ones.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Doctor, I have one question.[sr]May I ask it?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Hostile Servants and neutral Servants.[sr]Is there a way to distinguish them upon detection?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
It would be best if we had the ability to distinguish them from our observation data.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
For example, the ability to see if approaching Servants are enemies or possible allies[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
I am sorry.[sr]Unfortunately, that's impossible right now.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even if we combine Sheba and Trismegistus, the best we can do is to detect lifeforms and energy readings.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
The ability to distinguish hostility, that lies within the realm of psychology.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
For now, you can't quantify that with numbers.[sr]I'm sorry, Mash, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
But, we can speculate from the situation.[sr]I'll warn you if there's over 70% chance of hostility.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As for non-Servant readings of local humans, I will try my best to detect them as well.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
That's okay, Doctor.[sr]I'm sorry for asking too much of you.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
I realize it was logically unreasonable.[sr]But, even so...
[k]

？1：It was to reduce the danger, right?

？2：Was it to avoid fighting?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Yes. Strategically speaking,[sr]it's best to avoid unnecessary battles.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
But no, I knew it was an unreasonable request.[sr]Please forget it.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
No, forgive me.[sr]I know I'm putting you in unreasonable danger...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
To the best of my ability, I'll support and back you up.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I can promise you that much at least.[sr]Mash, [%1].
[k]

？1：Understood!

？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Thank you.[sr]...Well, let's start the Rayshift.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...Dr. Roman.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Quit being so gloomy![sr]I'll back you up mentally, as well!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
No, that's...[sr]It's just the sudden shift in mood is a little...
