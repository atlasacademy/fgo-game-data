The knights' formation has broken in two places, and refugees are escaping through them.

＠Dr. Roman
I detect about 50 life signs around [%1], and about 100 from the other location!

...We have to leave them on their own. Considering how far they are, if we tried to join them, we'd all be rounded up together.
[k]

＠Bedivere
The only thing we can do now is escape in different directions!

＠Da Vinci
Lucius[line 2] Bedivere is correct. We need to guard the rear for the refugees here.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Fortunately, Sir Gawain isn't pursuing us.[sr]Look, the sky has turned back to night.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I would hazard a guess that he hasn't received orders to leave the gate and give chase.

[charaFace D 2]
＠Da Vinci
Before that happens, we'll use the cover of darkness and get as far away from the Holy City as we can!

Oh, but before that[line 3]

Don't let them escape! Those given Holy Punishment must be purged! They will cause calamity if left alive!

I'll take charge of leading the refugees! Our efforts will be in vain if the refugees end up scattering everywhere!

This is such a large group of panicked people after all. Someone needs to take charge here!
