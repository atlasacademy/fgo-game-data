Commander [%1], Commander Mash,[sr]a message! It's from Her Majesty the Emperor.
[k]

＠Roman Soldier
There's been an ambush in the rear, both General[sr]Spartacus and General Lu Bu have left the battlefield.

!!!

＠Dr. Roman
Oh, no![sr]So the enemy deployed a two-front attack?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Roman Soldier
The two generals have defeated the enemy forces, but they've broken away in pursuit of remnants!
[k]

＠Roman Soldier
Then another force launched a surprise attack from both[sr]sides. General Boudica fell into the enemy's hands and was taken prisoner!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This is...[sr]Mmmm, this is not good at all...

Hmm? Oh, I seemed to be deep in thought.[sr]I have made my decision.

＠Nero
Our forces were outmatched in the previous battle...[sr]I will accept this as a stern truth.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
My generals are just as capable as the enemy[sr]"emperors." But two of them left the front line, and one is captured by the enemy.
[k]

＠Nero
There is nothing we can do about those two.[sr]No, it was my mistake.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
It might take a little bit of time, but I'm willing to believe Lu Bu and Spartacus will return to us.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
Therefore, at this point[line 2][sr]We will save Boudica!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Fortunately, Jing Ke found the location of enemy fort.[sr]We will charge in, destroy the fort, and save Boudica.

＠Mash
Doctor, something wrong?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I just feel uneasy. The one who[sr]captured Boudica is supposed to be a Servant.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
It's not something a regular human can do, but why are they barricading themselves in a fort?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's not that far from the United Empire capital.[sr]So it should be convenient to get back there.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The enemy is trying to lure us in.[sr]Is that what this means?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If they just want to destroy our force, the approach I mentioned earlier should be "better."
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We have at least two Servants.[sr]They should understand that too.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
That's why they cut off Lu Bu and Spartacus in such a spectacular manner.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Yes. Humans and Servants, I think the enemy[sr]has a good grasp of the clear difference.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Now, [%1].[sr]It's time for a decision.
[k]

？1：We're going to rescue Boudica.

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
I see.[sr]I knew you'd say that.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
You're too optimistic. We're at war.[sr]We need a strategic point of view.
[k]

？2：If it's a trap, we'll crush it.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...Senpai.[sr]You're starting to think like a Berserker.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I understand more Berserkers have materialized this time, but I don't think it's a good idea to be influenced by them.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
But...[sr]I don't believe your way of thinking is bad.
