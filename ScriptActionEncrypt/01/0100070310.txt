We were led right to the Royal Hall...[sr]I'm surprised how friendly everyone is...
[k]

？1：Merlin's our fastpass.

？！

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Yes. Although all the maidens seem to be avoiding Merlin...
[k]

＠Mash
So... We're still a ways away, but is that King Gilgamesh over there?

Don't make me repeat myself! The newer the information about the war, the better! Keep bringing me reports!

The harder we work, the less chance they'll have to attack! If you want to take it easy, keep fighting!

...The shipments from the city of Eresh are being delayed, eh... Did the Demonic Beasts set up a lair on the roads?

＠C：???
Send 20 men from the eastern barracks to clear the way. Temun can take command. It's his home. He knows it well.

[charaFace C 2]
＠C：???
Humph. Whose idiotic order was this!?[sr]Why aren't the Bašmu carcasses being sent to Eanna?

The researchers have nothing to do! This is the time to put their annoying little brains to work!

It'll be the end of the world if the wall breaks.[sr]Tell her food can't be taken to the underworld!

Is this the report from the astrologers?[sr]Good. They match what I observed.

The reading for the harvest season isn't bad.[sr]Give a lapis lazuli necklace to whoever is in charge.

[charaFace C 1]

But there's no time for them to rest![sr]Have them read the report from the Eridu search team!

＠C：???
...By the way, I heard that Tabado's daughter is giving birth. Send her a sacred prostitute to aid her, along with some healthy fruits.
[k]

＠C：???
And pull Tabado off the Northern Wall, and give him three days' rest. His grandson's face will give him courage.

That's right. You shouldn't wait for the king to have a spare moment.
[k]

＠Merlin
He won't wait for you either. You should say what's on your mind, even if it's a bit rude.
[k]

＠Merlin
Especially if you believe that's the right thing to do.[sr]Now here we go...

King Gilgamesh! I, Merlin, mage extraordinaire, have brought guests!

Busy? Yeah, I can see that, so don't worry![sr]I'll bring them right now!

Silence. Know your place, mage. The king just happened to be tired when he scribed the tablet.

Even I've never heard of memory loss from exhaustion, but...

＠High Priestess
...if the king says that's the case, then it must be.[sr]Do as he says and keep looking for it.

More importantly... Who are those people?[sr]They don't look like Uruks.

I'm busy! Even the time I'd have to spend to exchange words with you is too precious for me to spare!

＠Gilgamesh
Thus, I shall ascertain the truth of your words through battle! Prepare yourselves, mages of the Observatory!

That's great. I don't like to get my hands dirty.[sr]Ana, sorry, but would you give them a hand?

The king prides himself on his self-control, but let's be honest: he's not one to hold back in battle.

I mean, you prefer combat over conversation too, right? This is one of those fists speak louder than words moments!
