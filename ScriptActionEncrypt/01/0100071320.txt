Since we're in Eridu... You just have to see the finest cylinder seals Eridu has to offer.

？1：Cylinder seals...?

This is the center of Eridu, where royal authority was granted. It is a bit odd that I'd introduce you to this place, being a foreign deity...

＠Dr. Roman
Royal authority is “proof of kingship” as granted by the gods... Just think of it as being akin to a contract or covenant.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In Mesopotamia, the gods decide who will be king. One is chosen from among the rulers of the land.

＠Dr. Roman
As for the cylinder seals...

＠Merlin
They're those big pillars. The seals are, as the name suggests, like one's personal seal.
[k]

＠Merlin
[%1], perhaps you used stamp-like personal seals back home?
[k]

＠Merlin
You know, a drawing carved on a block, which you then press onto ink, so you can make many copies of it onto paper.
[k]

＠Merlin
Well, in Uruk[line 2]5,000 years before your time[line 2]that type of seal was already a part of daily life.
[k]

＠Merlin
Of course, they weren't used as signatures. They were for magical ceremonies.
[k]

＠Merlin
They had tales carved into them, were dipped in mud, and were then rolled onto things. Tools for the mass production of stories, if you will.
[k]

＠Merlin
It seems the cylinder seals here are the biggest and the oldest ones of all.
[k]

＠Merlin
Let's see. You won't be able to read it like this, so let me transcribe it onto the air.

“When a ring of light appears in the heavens, the land of Mesopotamia shall be returned to its origin.” Hm... It's a seal that predicted our current situation.

Yes. Eridu is a city of the same size as Uruk.

＠Dr. Roman
To the people of Mesopotamia, the contents of this seal may be well known.

The people of Uruk were afraid of Tiamat because they already knew of the prophecy on this seal.
