＠Marie Antoinette
Now that things have settled down, I'd like to introduce myself again.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
My True Name is Marie Antoinette.[sr]I'm from the Rider Class.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
As for who I am, I'd be happy if you could examine me closely with your eyes and ears.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
As for why I was summoned, unfortunately,[sr]I have no idea. After all, I have no Master.
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.1]
[charaFace F 0]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]
＠Amadeus
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.[sr]I'm the same as her.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Amadeus
As for why I was summoned, first of all, it just doesn't feel like I'm a hero.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Yes I'm great, but even so, I'm still just one of many artists...
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Amadeus
Well, I did apply magecraft in my music, but that was only because I was drawn to the sounds played by demons.
[k]

＠Mash
I'm Mash Kyrielight. I'm a Demi-Servant, and I don't know what my True Name is.
[k]

＠Mash
This is [%1].[sr]My Master.
[k]

？1：Nice to meet you.

[charaFadeout A 0.1]
[charaFace F 1]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]
＠Amadeus
Pleasure is mine. As fellow non-fighters, let's get along.
[k]

？2：Whassup.

[charaFadeout A 0.1]
[charaFace E 1]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
Oh my! What an interesting greeting![sr]Wh...Whassup! My homies!
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Marie Antoinette
Hmph, it seems different when [%1] says it... Perhaps I need to think more like a peasant...
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.1]
[charaFace A 14]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Mash
Come on... Don't teach her weird greetings.

Oh, I've got it! I have to be more needy![sr]Come on, Amadeus! Whassup!
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.1]
[charaFace F 1]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]
＠Amadeus
Whassup! I like it, Maria. Keep it up![sr]I can feel the love of a century beginning to fade!
[k]

[charaFadeout F 0.1]
[charaFace E 3]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
...Hmmph.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
I'm sorry [%1]. Whassup is a very[sr]stimulating greeting, but I must reluctantly refrain from it.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
If Amadeus likes it, that means it's not appropriate for a lady to use.

＠Marie Antoinette
Jeanne.[sr]Jeanne d'Arc, yes?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
The saint who saved France.[sr]One of the people I wished to meet in my life.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
...I'm, not a saint.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Yes, everyone knows that's how you saw yourself.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
But the way you lead your life was true, and we all know the results.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
That's why everyone will always remember and admire the name Jeanne d'Arc, and the miracle of Orleans.
[k]

＠Jeanne
...

＠Amadeus
Of course, your life ended at the stake and resulted in[sr]that witch. It's just like Maria to only look at the good parts.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Am I wrong, Jeanne d'Arc?[sr]Your life was a little out of tune.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Amadeus
Jeanne herself is the one who gets hurt when people call her a perfect saint.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Amadeus
Listen, Maria. You always say what you think others[sr]want to hear. Sometimes you need to scold or deny others.
[k]

[charaFadeout F 0.1]
[charaFace E 5]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
I-I don't need to hear that from you, Amadeus![sr]You already tell me that every day!
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
T-This is what you want, right?[sr]You piano-brain! Piece of human garbage!
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Marie Antoinette
You're a pervert who can only get it up for musical[sr]scales! If you like music so much, you should turn into a piano!
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.1]
[charaFace F 3]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]
＠Amadeus
...I don't know if I should say this, but when you insult me like that, I feel something indescribable.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Amadeus
But see? You can do it if you try![sr]Give the same treatment to Jeanne.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Amadeus
Faster. Stronger. More violent![sr]Tell her all of her flaws as you see them!
[k]

[charaFadeout F 0.1]
[charaFace E 0]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
Non, that's impossible Amadeus.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Human garbage like you has nothing but flaws.[sr]But Jeanne herself has none.
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.1]
[charaFace F 4]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]
＠Amadeus
[line 3]Are you serious? I didn't know you had it that bad.[sr]You really did love Jeanne d'Arc, didn't you?
[k]

[charaFadeout F 0.1]
[charaFace E 4]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
I would say "worship" rather than love.[sr]And a bit of guilt, as well.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
...A tiny "sorry", the size of a teaspoon.[sr]The natural guilt we foolish royals feel towards the Saint.
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.1]
[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠Jeanne
...Marie Antoinette.[sr]Your words honor me, but that's why I must confess.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
In life, I was no saint.
[k]

＠Jeanne
I held the flag high for what I believed in, and as a result, I stained my hands with blood.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
...Of course, I don't regret that.[sr]Nor do I regret the Inquisition[line 2]Or my own death.
[k]

＠Jeanne
But I shed too much blood.[sr]I believed in the dreams of a little country girl, but[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
At the time, I never imagined how high the price of that dream was.
[k]

＠Jeanne
I never regretted it, but never did I feel fear.[sr]...And that is my greatest sin.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Jeanne
Only the outcome of my actions made me a saint. I do[sr]not think it's the right word for a country girl like me.

＠Marie Antoinette
...I see.[sr]So you're not a saint, right?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
Then, may I call you Jeanne?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
...Y-Yes. Of course.[sr]It feels like that would bring back old memories.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
Wonderful.[sr]Call me Marie, then.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
If you're simply Jeanne, and not a saint, then I want to be Marie, and not a queen.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Please Jeanne, will you call me Marie?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne
Y-Yes.[sr]All right... Thank you, Marie.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
Thank you too.[sr]I am happy, Jeanne!
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Marie Antoinette
And I'm sorry. I keep pushing my own views on you.[sr]You've lost your own answers about yourself, haven't you?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Just like the day I died, not knowing a thing about what[sr]was going on. You'll have to find your own answers.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
I certainly want to treat you as a saint, but I'll stop myself!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
I won't just believe in you, I'll support you! Isn't that what female friends are supposed to do, Amadeus?
