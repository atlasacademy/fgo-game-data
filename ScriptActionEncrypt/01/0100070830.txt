＠Merlin
Hmm. Everybody's getting some sleep before tomorrow's fight. Morale's good, and we have enough combat strength, but...
[k]

＠Merlin
Something doesn't seem right. And my intuition is never wrong at times like this.
[k]

＠Merlin
Somebody might be saying goodbye tomorrow. One, no, maybe two.
[k]

＠Merlin
If our people start dying off now, it will complicate matters in the future. I'd like to avoid that, but[line 3]

Oww. It's rude to smack people for no reason, Cath Palug.

What? If I have time to walk, I should sleep? None of the women here at the Northern Wall are my type?

＠Merlin
How rude. I'm working, whether I look like it or not. See? [se ad230][seVolume ad230 0 0.4](Knock, knock, knock)
[k]

[seStop ad230]

＠Merlin
See? These flowers I just planted here? They'll take root in the wall, and should reinforce it a bit. I'm a helper.

＠Merlin
“Oh? Not bad, for a loser like you, Merlin.” Is that what you said?
[k]

＠Merlin
You've gained a nasty mouth since the last time I saw you.
[k]

＠Merlin
Then what was the point in me letting you out of that tower?
[k]

[charaShake B 0.1 0 10 0.7]
＠Fou
Fou. Fofofo, fou.

[charaFace A 2]
＠Merlin
Hmm. You have a nasty mouth, but you've gotten clever. That makes you even harder to deal with!

Hmm? Is that you, Ana? What are you doing at this corner of the wall?

＠Merlin
Hmm. You certainly don't look convincing with that furrowed brow.
[k]

＠Merlin
But it's a smart idea not to head into the Cedar Forest alone. There's no way to clear that temple right now.
[k]

＠Merlin
Now do you believe what I told you about the fastest way to improve the situation being one step at a time?
[k]

＠Ana
...I don't believe you at all. The reason I'm still here is...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Ana
...Is it too late to tell them what's going on? Maybe if I do, they'll at least...
[k]

＠Merlin
Oh, are you sure? I think that might freak out even [%1].
[k]

＠Ana
...You think so? But even so...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Merlin
It's not good. Not good at all.
[k]

＠Merlin
Your distrust of humans is starting to waver, and your hopes for them are coming back.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Merlin
Emotions are, in general, things to be discarded. But if you're able to reclaim them, it'd be a waste to not cherish them.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Merlin
You're keeping your distance from humans not because you don't like them, but because they scare you.
[k]

＠Merlin
You're afraid they'll find out who you really are. You're afraid they'll hate you.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Merlin
That's an emotion hard to come by. You could call it the conscience of the divine being you truly are.
[k]

＠Merlin
That conscience[line 2]or its lack[line 2]is the greatest difference between you and her. To toss it aside would be a waste, Ana.
[k]

＠Ana
...So you're telling me to keep quiet and hide it?
[k]

＠Merlin
Yes. That's the smartest thing to do. What's wrong with a non-human hiding her inhumanity?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Merlin
I mean, I say that, but I'm no different. To tell the truth, I don't have a heart like a human.
[k]

＠Merlin
Because I have no emotions, I feed off of people's dreams, and harvest the “subtleties of the heart” from them.
[k]

＠Merlin
The only reason I can keep on being a nice bro-next-door is because I'm expending the emotions I've gathered up to this point as fuel.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Merlin
It's difficult for beings such as us to think and live like humans.
[k]

＠Merlin
The fake Enkidu was correct. Fairies, gods, and creatures of that sort are inhuman.
[k]

＠Merlin
But there's no rule that what's inhuman must necessarily be an enemy of mankind, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Merlin
You're allowed to side with them because it's fun. Whether they love you, or if you can love them, is a different matter.
[k]

＠Ana
...Do you love mankind, Merlin?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Merlin
Of course not. I'm inhuman. A half-breed sired by an incubus. I've done all kinds of awful things in the name of helping human society.
[k]

＠Merlin
I love the patterns mankind weaves. I've never really liked individual humans themselves.
[k]

＠Merlin
...And trying to justify it all to myself only tore me apart. It's what resulted in me locking myself in my tower. But that's a different story.
[k]

＠Merlin
Who cares if you hide who you are until the end? It's not going to hurt anyone.
[k]

＠Merlin
[%1] won't care that you hid something. Doesn't care now, right?
[k]

＠Merlin
[%1] is happier being with you now than [&he would:she would] be if [&he:she] found out your secrets.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Ana
...Yes. And that annoys me.
[k]

＠Ana
...It's humiliating. Having you tell me this, Merlin, is the biggest shame of my life. In the end, I will kill you.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Merlin
Humph. I'll take that as a compliment.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Merlin
Even if you did reveal your True Name, it would only tell them who the enemy is. It wouldn't help them fight it.
[k]

＠Merlin
Your existence would be the vital point the Goddess of Demonic Beasts didn't expect.
[k]

＠Merlin
If there's a time to for you to throw away everything, it's going to be only in a single instant. Watch for that instant as you fight.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Merlin
...Of course, amid all this foreshadowing, it's worth mentioning that I don't want that kind of ending at all! 'Cuz that would be boring!
[k]

＠Merlin
Sad partings aren't my style. I prefer to deceive and disparage the enemy, and emerge as the victor unharmed!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Merlin
That's the most beautiful pattern humans can create. Why don't we take a lesson from it, Ana?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Ana
...Disgusting. You only say what's most convenient for you.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Ana
...But I guess I don't mind putting in some effort to make that outcome a reality.
