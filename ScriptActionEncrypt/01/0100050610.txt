That nap was exactly three hours.[sr]Rest when you can. That's the spirit.

？2：Where are we?

Geronimo said to take a nap since it's going to be a long journey, but...

Relax. This is a small town in the West. The residents have already evacuated, likely due to the Celts' fierce attacks.

＠Nightingale
I'm surprised you can even talk.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Anyway, I'll heal you.[sr]First, your heart is about to lose all functionality.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Because of that, blood cannot circulate properly in your body... I must cut it out.
[k]

＠Nightingale
...All limbs, I mean. And if possible, I'll take all organs out except your lungs too!
[k]

＠D：???
W-Wait, wait, wait![sr]Focus on repairing just my heart, no amputation!

＠D：???
I cannot lose any means to fight!

What are you talking about?[sr]There is no greater joy than being alive!

As an individual life form who has taken root on this earth, you have a duty to survive, come what may!

Cú Chulainn... Ireland's most renowned hero, nicknamed the Child of Light.

They say if he aims his lance, Gáe Bolg,[sr]it always pierces his target's heart.

...I suppose it would be difficult to avoid that,[sr]even if you are the hero of the Ramayana.
