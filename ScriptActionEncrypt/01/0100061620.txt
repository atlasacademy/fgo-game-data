We will believe that you do not serve the Lion King and that you wish to oppose his tyranny.

Furthermore, it was only with your help that we were able to save Serenity.

Because of all of this, our plan to stage an uprising against the Holy City was kept secret.

＠Hundred Personas
All of you have contributed to the wellbeing of every citizen of this land. Great job.

If you want words out of me, you'll have to win them from me fair and square! ...In battle, of course!
[k]
