＠Drake
Mmm... Sniff, sniff.[sr]Treasure, will I get a whiff of that treasure?
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
Captain Drake, treasure has no scent.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Ahaha! You think so, Mash?[sr]Treasure does indeed have a scent.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
What?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
Ah, that look says you don't believe me![sr]All right, let's make a bet.
[k]

＠Drake
If there's treasure up ahead, like I said...[sr]Hmm, what should we do?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
I know, how about coming with me on a trip around the world?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Around the world you say?
[k]

＠Drake
When I flee these waters and return to England[line 2][sr]I'm going to sail around the world on the Golden Hind.
[k]

＠Drake
What do you say? If you help me out,[sr]I bet I'll be the luckiest pirate ever.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Around the world...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
Of course [%1] will come along, too.[sr]You're Mash's Master, aren't you?
[k]

？1：I'll see what I can do.

？2：I'll think about it.

？！

＠Drake
All right, and if I lose[line 2][sr]If I lose... Hmm, is there anything else you want?
[k]

？1：Nothing.

？2：I have enough already.

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
There is nothing I want. If I had to choose,[sr]having your assistance like this is enough.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Really? That's really greedy, you got me there![sr]That's gonna cost you dearly!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
E-Excuse me? Senpai and I both answered that we've[sr]been repaid already. Actually, Senpai, we have a good deal.
[k]

＠Drake
What's gotten into you? You said you have no wishes.[sr]That's the most troublesome wish.
[k]

＠Drake
Because, you can't buy items that "don't exist."[sr]I am, after all, a merchant!
[k]

＠Drake
If I can't keep my customers happy, then I'll be a[sr]third-rate one. And THAT, I will not have.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Drake
That's why first,[sr]I need to get whatever it is you want.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Drake
But, you said you couldn't think of anything.[sr]Now, this is going to be a problem. How can I deliver something you don't want?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...I see. I'm beginning to understand why[sr]this crude outlaw of a woman has THAT skill.

Hopefully we can talk it out with them[line 2]

I'll pay my respects, but also give him a dose of reality![sr][%1], this is how we say it in the pirate world!
