It's been three days since we Rayshifted to the ruins of Babylon... Master, we've finally arrived at Uruk.
[k]

＠Mash
It looks like we'll have to pass through an inspection checkpoint before we get into the city...
[k]

＠Mash
There's still some distance between us. Maybe we can sneak into the city without them noticing...

＠Uruk Soldier
Are you refugees from Ur? Then please be careful. The king has given the Ritual Sect more power, what with it being a war and all...
[k]

＠Uruk Soldier
Uruk is surrounded by a ritual warding the Demonic Beasts, but it seems to have some effects on humans as well.

Sumerians started showing up in history around 4000 B.C.. But their civilization was quite elaborate.
[k]

＠Merlin
It's the oldest human civilization. It began when people abandoned a village-based society hosting thousands...
[k]

＠Merlin
...and formed city-states housing tens of thousands of people by pioneering crop production boosts through irrigated farming.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Merlin
Of course, with a country that big, the invention of writing and the implementation of higher education in schools was only a matter of time.
[k]

＠Merlin
Though they were not blessed with lumber, the fertile lands sandwiched by the two great rivers created quality mud...
[k]

＠Merlin
...which the Sumerians kneaded to make clay.[sr]That, in turn, was used to build many fortresses.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Merlin
That is Mesopotamia, the land of mud, clay, wheat, and sheep.
