＠Nero
[line 2]Now then.[sr]My Rome is currently endangered.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
My great empire's territories are now, vexingly enough, ripped apart and scattered all over.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
On one hand, there is the true Roman Empire that I rule[sr]over. The area centered around this capital, Rome.
[k]

＠Nero
On the other hand, there is an alliance controlled by multiple "emperors", that suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
The United Roman Empire. That's what they called[sr]themselves when they stole half of my empire.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
The United Empire is still a mystery to us. No matter[sr]how many scouts we send out, none ever return.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Even the location of the capital where these fake emperors gather is unknown to us.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Multiple emperors, you say?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
That's right.[sr]In my eyes, they're just a group of treacherous bandits. 
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
And...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
...No, it's not worth mentioning.[sr]Just rebels spreading their vicious lies.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
They call themselves emperors, but they're just pretenders.
[k]

？1：You look troubled.

？2：Is something bothering you?

？！

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
...Senpai.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
No, it's fine.[sr]You saw one of them before.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
Caligula, the enemy general. The man who[sr]singlehandedly slaughtered my forces before you arrived.
[k]

＠Nero
He's one of the traitors who calls himself "emperor."[sr]As well as being...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
...my uncle.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Shouldn't he be dead already?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Yes, dear formless mage.[sr]That is correct.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Even our Court Mage was killed by Uncle Caligula, but if he was still alive you might have gotten along well.
[k]

＠Nero
Our mage boasted that he had overcome death.[sr]In truth, he showed me some impressive spells.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
But... He was killed by that one "emperor's" sword.
[k]

＠Nero
A master of spells who shouldn't have died, yet died[sr]easily. ...It shouldn't be possible, yet, he did.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
To easily beat a mage of this era...[sr]That's no ordinary human. It's a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
That must be causing the historical anomaly.[sr]One of the "emperors" got hold of the Grail.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's highly likely that is the cause of this era's singularity.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Honestly, the United Empire is very strong. Violent[sr]battles are occurring all over and the people suffer.
[k]

＠Nero
I've dispatched all my serving viceroys and generals, and thrown nearly every troop at them. Yet the United Empire's power is undiminished.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
Recently, an expeditionary force of theirs pressed in on[sr]the capital. They even managed to get inside.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
I only had a few of my troops to defend us.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
I hate to say it... But it showed me that this situation[sr]is beyond my ability to break by myself.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Nero
Therefore.[sr]I order you, no, I implore you!
[k]

＠Nero
Become my generals! Then Rome and I[sr]shall assist you in obtaining this Holy Grail!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Such a heaven-sent proposal.[sr]It seems we have a common cause.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
That's right.[sr]What do you think, Senpai?
[k]

？1：Let's cooperate.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Ah, I see! I see![sr]That's a quick response!
[k]

？2：Do we get a salary?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Of course. As soon as the United Empire is beaten,[sr]I shall give you what you desire.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
I shall grant one of you the title of viceroy, as well as reward for the work you've already done.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Rest well tonight.[sr]I shall prepare quarters suitable for a viceroy for you.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Oh yes, will the invisible mage require them as well?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Don't worry about me.[sr]Supplying a room for those two will be enough.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
By the way Your Majesty, have you ever heard the name Lev Lainur?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
...Lev? No I haven't, who is he?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
A mage of our era. He betrayed Chaldea and all humanity.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
There's a chance he's in this era. Although, I don't[sr]know if he's revealed himself or taken any action.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
A mage from a foreign land?[sr]...Hmm.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
I've heard there is a powerful mage in the United Empire.[sr]It's only a rumor, but someone saw that mage on the front lines.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...It's possible.[sr]Your Majesty, I have a request.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
Speak.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'd like Mash and [%1] to be[sr]deployed as close to the front lines as possible.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Nero
I don't mind, but...[sr]Will [%1] be all right?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Yes.[sr]Lev Lainur is our enemy.
[k]

？1：We owe him some payback.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...Yes, Master.
[k]

？2：The Director will be avenged.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...That's right.[sr]We can't let him go after the way he killed the Director.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
Very well.[sr]Nero Claudius will honor your request.
[k]

＠Nero
I shall pray to the gods and divine ancestors of Rome that your enemy be defeated.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
But first, how about a feast before you rest!
[k]

＠Nero
Not as grand as usual due to the war, but it will still be a feast where I spare no efforts.
[k]

＠Nero
[%1], Mash, do you drink?[sr]We have something special imported from the Orient!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Oh, uh, no drinking for me thanks...

Your Majesty! The eastern city gate is under[sr]attack by a mid-size United Empire force!
[k]

I think they're remnants of that expeditionary force![sr]Our eastern gate can't hold them back!

Go Mash, [%1].[sr]Looks like your time has come.
[k]

It won't be unusual if another Servant shows up as an enemy general. Stay on guard!
