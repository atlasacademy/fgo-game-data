Hey, gimme a break.[sr]I didn't mean any harm...

It was my instinct as a pirate...

Wh-What a poor excuse for a pirate!

Who's Boss?
[k]

＠Pirate
Heh heh heh, listen and be amazed... Francis Drake,[sr]the greatest, most glorious pirate on the high seas!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Why this swagger all of a sudden?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Hmm. Perhaps it's a desperate attempt to seem more[sr]"pirate" like. That's what I think.

After we get through the forest, you'll find[sr]the Great Pirate Francis Drake's secret hideout.
[k]

＠Pirate
Heh heh heh... You guys are done for.[sr]When Boss gets a hold of you, you'll be...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Why does this person keep talking like a grunt?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Setting up one's character is important in any era.[sr]It's even normal to recreate your body into a beautiful idol.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Sorry Da Vinci, but can you just go back to your workshop?
[k]

＠Pirate
What's with all the ruckus?[sr]Is it magic? Magic or something!?

Oh my, what is this adorable little creature.[sr]It looks delicious.

＠Fou
Fou!?
[k]

？1：Eat him and I'll beat you till you cry.

？2：Eat him and I'll crush you till you cry.

？！

Yes, sorry!

＠Mash
Master, we need to press onward.
[k]

＠Mash
Francis Drake.[sr]One of the great heroes that pioneered this world.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
We are in the midst of the Age of Exploration[line 3][sr]If he's the real Drake, he's probably a living being.
[k]

＠Mash
He's the first voyager in history to sail around the globe[sr]and live to tell the tale.
[k]

＠Mash
England received great fortune from his actions. They[sr]bested Spain, who had been dominating the world seas.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Spain was once touted as The Sun That Never Sets.[sr]But even Spaniards feared him, the "El Draque"...
[k]

＠Mash
Truly the "Hero Who Brought Down the Sun." The prosperity of the British Empire wouldn't be possible without Captain Drake.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Though Drake was officially sanctioned by the state as a[sr]corsair... A pirate is still a pirate.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Judging from the behavior of pirates we've met so far,[sr]odds are high that he's a good-for-nothing thug.
[k]

？1：Don't let your guard down.

？2：Roman's just as good-for-nothing.

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes, that is correct.
[k]

＠Mash
Most likely a gluttonous giant, a nefarious character[sr]able to grab a barrel in one hand and chug its contents.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...It is quite disturbing, but[sr]there is no doubt he is a key person of this era.
[k]

＠Mash
We must somehow get[sr]the help of Francis Drake.

Boss! BOSS![sr]We've got enem... err, guests, I mean!
[k]

＠Pirate
They said they wish to speak with you, Boss!
[k]

＠Drake
The hell? Geez, right when I'm in a[sr]good mood from this good rum[line 2]
[k]

＠Drake
Guests? Are they pirates?
[k]

＠Pirate
Umm, I don't think so![sr]They seem a bit classier than us, and a bit more violent!

So you don't know... Fine, bring them in!
