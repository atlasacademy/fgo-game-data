＠Geronimo
We're currently in the western region of North America. The Celtic warriors seem to mainly be coming from the East.
[k]

＠Geronimo
American army bases and cities have fallen one after another.
[k]

＠Geronimo
While most of them massacre men and women of all ages, some Servants seem to allow non-combatants to escape.
[k]

＠Geronimo
It's fine to be an honorable Servant, but those that escaped are going to die sooner or later regardless.
[k]

＠Geronimo
The East is almost completely occupied. And... This is the most important part...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Geronimo
They're using Washington as their base. In other words, the original capital.

Are you sure of that?
[k]

＠Geronimo
It's information from a man who escaped from Washington, but I have no proof.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Geronimo
...Still, if you don't mind hearing my personal intuition, I believe this is the enemy's main stronghold.

＠Geronimo
When seeking to humiliate a nation,[sr]the most effective method is to occupy their capital.
[k]

＠Geronimo
On the other hand, the United Western States led by Edison has been actively accepting refugees from the East.
[k]

＠Geronimo
He makes them work in mechanized infantry factories, and diligently makes improvements each day.
[k]

＠Geronimo
He is accompanied by Helena Blavatsky, with whom he was also friends in life[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Geronimo
As well as one of the most powerful beings in Indian mythology, the “Hero of Benefaction” Karna, from the Mahabharata.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Blavatsky may be obvious, but it's unknown why Karna would have taken his side...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Geronimo
Regardless, those three and their mechanized infantry seem to be compensating for their lack of Servants.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Now, assuming that Washington is the enemy stronghold[line 2]the question is, what should we do next?

I know! Can't we wait for them to destroy each other?
[k]

＠Geronimo
That would be difficult.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Since the Celts possess the Grail, Edison's army can't close the military power gap regardless of the improvements he's made.
[k]

＠Geronimo
If anything, it's the chaotic nature of the current situation that allows small forces like us to move around freely.
[k]

＠Billy
That's true.[sr]Never mind!

[k]

＠Geronimo
An outlaw, an outcast, a lone wolf.[sr]...That's the type of folk we are.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Given the chance, they will exploit that weakness of ours. So there's only one way to win.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Geronimo
We must search for specific Servants, and eliminate them.
[k]

＠Geronimo
As I thought, our only option is assassination. We'll infiltrate their base and take out the Servants.

[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Geronimo
You're correct, dragon girl.
[k]

＠Geronimo
The capital has the toughest defense in a nation. It would be difficult for even an Assassin to infiltrate and assassinate someone.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Geronimo
Normally, at least.

Which means?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Geronimo
...Celtic warriors are extremely belligerent.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Also, considering the haphazard nature of their invasions, it's obvious they simply do as they please.
[k]

＠Geronimo
In other words[line 2]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 7]
[charaFadein A 0.1 2]
＠Mash
...The Celtic warriors won't place any emphasis on defending the capital?
[k]

＠Geronimo
That's my speculation. They simply see a fortress as a place to live, and not a place to defend.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Geronimo
They stress about how strong their warriors ought to[sr]be[line 3] Their society values individuals more than the whole.

＠Robin Hood
Ah, I get it. Rather than build up a castle's defenses, they think they can rely on their own strength.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
That's the opposite of Edison, who believes in uniformity and strength in numbers. No wonder their castle is shorthanded.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Yeah. However, this is a gamble.
[k]

＠Geronimo
We have no way to defend the West. We must gamble since the difference in military strength is overwhelming.

Medical treatment is pointless if it doesn't address the source. If Washington is the lesion, it must be cut out.

Yes, exactly. That's why I want to split our force into two.
[k]

＠Geronimo
One group will go with Nightingale in pursuit of the Servant Sita, who has ties to Rama, for his treatment.
[k]

＠Geronimo
The other will infiltrate the East,[sr]and carry out the assassination.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Geronimo
...The assassination mission is dangerous, there's a high chance of failure. We must avoid clumping up and getting wiped out.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Personally, I'd like Mash and [%1] to accompany Nightingale and Rama.

Umu. While I'd love to see whose song is better... We can't exactly sing loudly during an assassination mission.

＠Nero Bride
That would be boring.

That's why when we meet again, we'll make a big stage. They'll be the judges, and we'll finally settle things.
