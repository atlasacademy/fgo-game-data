That armor was made to rebel against King Arthur. Naturally it would try to reject the Lion King's Gift.

That means... Mordred wasn't at full strength!?

So screw my reputation. I'll obliterate this mountain... and you along with it.

(Sigh) I dunno about that guy. He's about to blow everything up, including himself, right?

His Gift is Rampage, isn't it? I bet he's about to unleash all of his power and blow this entire mountain away along with that sword.

Rampaging magical energy would only lead to your own demise, even for a Heroic Spirit. At most you get to power up your Noble Phantasm for a bit.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Arash
However, your Gift is different. “Rampage” sounds cool, but it's no different than a nuclear meltdown.

If you're feeling frustrated, start over and put everything on the line. We'll call this a draw.

Fine, I'll play along. This round's my loss. Besides, my unit's been annihilated.

I'll let this village go, too. I was only hunting you vermin anyway.

＠Mordred
If that coward there's gonna be meeting with the Lion King, we'll face off in the Holy City no matter what.

＠Mordred
...The contest is on hold till then.

This is an oath of a knight, given in return for sparing my life. I will never break it.
