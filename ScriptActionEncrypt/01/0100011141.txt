＠Siegfried
I seem to be the only one here with experience leading an army.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Siegfried
Of course, it's not as if I have a glorious military record where I led an army to invade a worthwhile country.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Siegfried
In any event, our numbers are few while the enemy's are large.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Siegfried
...But, most of the enemy's forces are weaker than us.[sr]In situations like this, there are two options.
[k]

＠Siegfried
A frontal assault, or an ambush from the rear.[sr]However, our location was given away long ago.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Siegfried
Stealth is out of the question. The enemy knows where we are... There's only one option.

＠Siegfried
Master and I will see to Fafnir.
[k]

＠Siegfried
I want the others to protect us from Servants and wyverns.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Siegfried
Whether we slay Fafnir or not, the outcome of this war hinges on that question.

Oh Puppy, there is someone I must fight.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Elisabeth
Would it be all right if I focus on her.
[k]

？1：Go ahead.

[charaFace H 1]
＠Elisabeth
Oh? Thanks.
[k]

？2：Who do you want to fight?

[charaFace H 5]
＠Elisabeth
Oh, a Servant I share a certain fate with.
[k]

？！

[charaFace H 0]
＠Elisabeth
If I can do that, I'll be quite satisfied.[sr]...I'll lend you a hand if I can spare the time.

Can you defeat her?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

...Yes, I shall be victorious.

Even if she turns out to be the real Jeanne d'Arc, I will still prevail in battle.

Hm, I don't have an issue with anybody.[sr]I guess I will just try to get wyverns' attention.

Doctor, those have the opposite effect. They cause[sr]stomachaches, so maybe you shouldn't drink them...
