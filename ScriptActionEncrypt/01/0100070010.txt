＠Romani Archaman
Morning, Mash. I have something personal to discuss with you today.
[k]

＠Mash
This morning, the Doctor came to me like any other day.
[k]

＠Mash
His voice, his breath, his mannerisms.[sr]He was the same calm, peaceful man he always was.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Romani Archaman
As your primary physician, I need to have a serious discussion with you. I'm going to grit my teeth and tell you the truth here.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
Mash Kyrielight, your lifespan is nearing its limit.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
Just like humanity has no future past 2019, you have no future beyond that time.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
This was decided at the beginning.[sr]You can't stop it, I can't stop it. No one can stop it.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
Even the Grail, the supposedly omnipotent wish granter, cannot change this fate.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠Romani Archaman
After all, the Grail is merely a shadow that fell just one step lower from a higher dimensional phase. A great crystallized magical resource.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
Calling it an omnipotent wish granter is like saying you can buy anything with money.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
The truth is, the Grail can only execute what a human envisions. It is not omnipotent. Don't be mistaken about that.
[k]

＠Mash
I silently agreed. The Grail is only a means of accelerating things.
[k]

＠Mash
Raising buildings. Building cities. Making epochs.
[k]

＠Mash
For everything humans have done, the Grail uses its vast stores of magical energy to make the process quicker.
[k]

＠Mash
Why was the Doctor telling me something that I already knew?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Romani Archaman
You're going to die soon. It has nothing to do with your own will. It's simply how you were created.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
Do you find that frustrating? Or sad?[sr]Does it make you feel empty?
[k]

＠Mash
Well, I[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠Romani Archaman
It's terrible. I'm not talking about Chaldea's research.[sr]I'm talking about all of humanity, and all of life.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
Living things are destined to die from the moment they're born. And yet, they possess the capacity to grow.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
If something's going to die, why bother growing? Both the physical body and the spirit should maintain the same state from birth till death.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
If they did, there would be no sadness or pain. Everything would be equal. Everything would have meaning from the beginning.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Romani Archaman
But this planet's life is nothing but waste.[sr]It's essentially growing just so that it can die.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
It's meaningless. Truly meaningless. The more time passes, the more life leaves this world unfulfilled.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
I can't help but think that, when it comes to the life-forms on this world, the planet simply has the wrong settings.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Romani Archaman
Don't you think so, Mash?[sr]You are half-manmade.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
You are an incomplete being, a product made by imperfect humans who tried to play God.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
You have the right to hate them, and the duty to reject them. Human history has no value.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
All this is no more than the remnants left behind by humans leading meaningless lives.
[k]

＠Romani Archaman
It just so happens to look like a picture that has meaning.
[k]

＠Mash
...What was strange was how gentle his words were.
[k]

＠Mash
Everything he said was impossible for me to accept.[sr]I couldn't agree at all.
[k]

＠Mash
But his voice was so gentle.[sr]His words were filled with wisdom and compassion.
[k]

＠Mash
“If it's causing you pain, you can stop.” He whispered into my ear with a voice both sweet and dangerous.
[k]

＠Mash
But...

The last Singularity... This is the Grail that Solomon sent into the past himself, and I'd like you to recover it.

The beginning of all civilization, the world when it was unified as one.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The mother that flourished along the Tigris and Euphrates and influenced a great many civilizations.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
One of the world's oldest civilizations, which began almost simultaneously with the earliest Egyptian kingdoms.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In the world of magecraft, this era was the twilight of the Age of Gods and a topic of research.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The land of ancient Mesopotamia, 2600 B.C. The beginning of Sumerian civilization after the Ubaid culture.

The word “Mesopotamia” is Greek in origin.[sr]“Meso” means middle, and “potamia” means river.

Some may have lasted into the A.D. era in some island countries, but by 1000 A.D. they were gone.

＠Dr. Roman
Except for extreme cases, like deities that remained completely isolated from humans.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Well, let's put that topic aside. What I really wanted to talk to you about was the difficulty of this Rayshift.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Rayshifting into the B.C. era is extremely difficult.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The further back into human history you go, the more unstable the Rayshift. So, as you get closer to the Age of Gods, things get more uncertain.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Some academics call the Age of Gods an age of uncertainty. It's not something that lends itself to observation.

Yeah. If you're asking about the meaning of it all, well, there isn't any.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Nothing has meaning on its own.[sr]Meaning is something that gets determined later.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Humans are born, grow up, and die all without meaning.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's only when a life's over that you finally see what it meant.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's what life is, Mash.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We don't live in order to create meaning.[sr]We live so meaning can be found from our life.

＠Mash
...Yes. That's how I'd like to live my life, too.
[k]

＠Mash
Thank you, Dr. Roman. I'm grateful for all the kindness you've shown me.

All right, you're both in your Coffins, yeah?

＠Dr. Roman
[%1], your mission this time is to recover the Grail.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's important to find and remove the cause of the Singularity, but your biggest goal is to recover the Grail.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We don't know its exact coordinates. But it should be somewhere in Mesopotamia, your Rayshift destination.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I pray that this is our last search for the Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Dr. Roman
All right! I'm starting the Rayshift program!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Everyone here on Chaldea's staff will do their very best to send Master [%1] to the B.C. era!
