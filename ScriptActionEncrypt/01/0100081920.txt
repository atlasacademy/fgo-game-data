We are invincible. As long as Solomon's Grand Temple of Time exists, the 72 Demon Gods cannot perish.

Do it in memory of Mash Kyrielight. Strike me with those frail human fists of yours, and then die.

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah. It was over a decade ago.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
When the head of Chaldea, Marisbury Animusphere, joined the Holy Grail War, he prepared the greatest catalyst possible: this ring.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
King Solomon sent it into the distant future at the time of his death.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Dr. Roman
He didn't know why at that stage.[sr]He thought it was just another of God's whims.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Dr. Roman
But Marisbury dug up the ring and summoned a Heroic Spirit to win the Holy Grail War.
[k]

[charaFace C 8]
＠Dr. Roman
That was Solomon. The very first Heroic Spirit summoned by Chaldea. Alongside Marisbury, he obtained the Grail, and had his wish granted.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Dr. Roman
His wish was a very ordinary one: “I want to be human.”

＠Dr. Roman
(Sigh) Well, it doesn't matter.[sr]Anyway, Solomon's wish was granted.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Dr. Roman
But, there was a problem: Solomon possessed the skill Clairvoyance. In fact, his was so potent that it was essentially omniscience.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
When he became human, he lost all those powers.[sr]That wasn't a big problem on its own, but[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Just before his power left him, he saw it: the end of mankind.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He panicked, but by then, he was already human.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Who? How? For what purpose?[sr]And how could it be stopped?
[k]


[charaFace C 5]
＠Dr. Roman
He had no way of knowing anymore. He had turned into a normal human by then. But, he couldn't just ignore it.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Because, somehow, he was involved.[sr]That much he was certain of.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Dr. Roman
And that's how my journey began; a journey to relearn how to be human, quite literally from scratch.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I didn't know who the enemy was, or what would cause it all. The only thing I could do was endure, and prepare for when the time came.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]
＠Dr. Roman
Of course, a few instances of good fortune helped me along the way. The greatest of them was you, [%1].

[charaFace C 0]

＠Dr. Roman
...And I don't just mean on the day we met.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
During this entire Grand Order, there was never a time you weren't there to help me.

＠Dr. Roman
I thank you for that, from the bottom of my heart. Thanks to you and Mash, I was able to reach this moment.
