I have confirmed the presence of nine enemy pillars...![sr]I am not sure we can take on so many of them!

Indeed. This is the first time I'm seeing them up close, and I am astonished that you battled such monsters.

I must express my incredible respect for your prowess and bravery!

I'm sure you're all capable of overcoming this trial on your own, but allow me to assist you.

What's done is done. There is no point brooding over an unpopular concert.

Don't you know that the memories of the masses are malleable? If you give a spectacular performance now, your past mistakes will be forgiven...mostly!

[charaFace G 4]
＠Amadeus
It baffles me that a man your age doesn't know that!
[k]

＠Amadeus
It is amazing that someone as sensitive as you could tolerate a moniker like “Monsieur de Paris.”
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

I mean, a “Man of Paris?” How mortifying![sr]I would have skipped town before the day was through!

＠Amadeus
Being a mere stagehand is not enough. Step out onto center stage and work ten times as hard as penance!

Besides, this is a battle to save people. Surely that's a thousand times better than standing on an execution stage?

Greetings, Fräulein. We meet once again.[sr]Do you remember my one tidbit of advice?
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Amadeus
Well, I suppose that is irrelevant at the moment.[sr]We don't have time for chitchat just now.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Are you ready? We shall exterminate the Demon Gods together.

[charaFace G 0]
＠Amadeus
...Truth be told, I actually have a bit of a connection to these things.
[k]

＠Amadeus
But fortunately, I had not the slightest interest in aligning with those 72 Demon Gods in any way.

[charaFace G 1]
＠Amadeus
I had long since sold my soul to music.[sr]Someone must have become Amdusias instead of me.

Or perhaps...

This is shaping up to be quite the battle, but we have plenty of help this time.

Let us finish off this prelude so that we may hurry on to our next venue!
