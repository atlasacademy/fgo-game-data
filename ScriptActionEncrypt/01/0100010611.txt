＠Da Vinci
Hey guys, are you enjoying your[sr]trip through 15th century France?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Now then, let's get today's lecture started.[sr]Today I'll be talking about Servant categories.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Most of the Servants that can be summoned are divided into seven classes.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Saber, Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker, Caster, Assassin.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Each class has various compatibilities.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Saber has the advantage over Lancer, for instance.[sr]And Lancer over Archer, and Archer over Saber.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Rider over Caster, Caster over Assassin, and Assassin over Rider.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And Berserker is strong against all classes, but weak when attacked.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's like a game of rock, paper, scissors.[sr]Keep this in mind when fighting the enemy.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Of course, there are some Servants who don't fall into these categories.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I'll explain them another time.[sr]Okay, circle's good to go. Have a nice journey!
