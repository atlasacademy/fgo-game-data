A gathering of intellect. Any plans they come up with will certainly be troublesome, but they haven't been very effective against the voraciousness of the Roman army.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
Raw power alone should be enough to push them back. If I could ask for more, I'd want something with a bit of extra flair, but...

We're good, Professor. I'm ready anytime.[sr]I'll annihilate the nine pillars over there.

I guess it's not possible to completely take them out, but that's fun in and of itself. I get to keep fighting, right?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Alexander
That gives me a chance to try out a bunch of things. Over a hundred different tactics come to mind.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠El-Melloi II
...Too much is just as bad as not enough.[sr]But I don't think you'll understand.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
One hundred is too many. Normally, I'd suggest you carefully select ten tactics and focus on improving them.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

But this situation is the exception. If there's an infinite supply of enemies, there's nothing better than having as many tactics as possible.

It'd be virtually impossible to capture and analyze the entire Temple of Time, but I was able to study the mechanics of its throne.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
It's an enormous solid magical summoning circle with planetary magecraft at its core. If I'm right about that, then we have a little something up our sleeve, too.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Alexander
That's amazing, Professor. So are we, like, sucking up magical energy from the enemy?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Alexander
I don't really like that. Their writhing magical energy gives me the creeps.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

No, I'm not going to let you use that.[sr]We're just going to use its structure to our advantage.

I will create a path for the magical energy. I may not be a Master currently, but in principle, it should be possible.

Mars... Yes, now that you mention it, Altera loved the God of War for some reason...

Nero, you wouldn't know, but that's the true sword of my father, the War God Mars.

＠Nero
What...? Holy Progenitor, what did you just say!?

[charaFace D 4]
＠Romulus
It's a giant sword of light that the God of War, Mars, who is virtually manifested in satellite orbit, wields. The conceptualization of war itself.
[k]

＠Romulus
It uses Altera's magical energy in itself, but its power output is compounded. Probably.

It's been a while since I've seen it.[sr]Looks like she wields it more skillfully than my father.
