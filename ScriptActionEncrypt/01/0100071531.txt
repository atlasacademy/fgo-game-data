Enemy Demonic Beasts annihilated! Good work!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm not picking up any more around the area. Looks like that was all the Demonic Beasts that were nesting in Babylon!

The battle has just begun.

＠Dr. Roman
The first wave of Demonic Beasts has passed through Nippur, and will engage the Northern Wall defense force in five minutes.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And leading the charge is a young man with green hair[line 3]it's Kingu, commander of Tiamat's Eleven Offspring.

I agree, Jaguar. Normally both sides of a fight are at fault, but those Demonic Beasts were twisted by Gorgon.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
They've lost their ability to reproduce in order to up their combat capability. They're sad creatures that will die out once this is all over.

Are they good, or are they evil? No sé! But I would rather fight for the side that has a future, yes!

You, the goddess that had the civilization she nurtured destroyed by the savage conqueror Cortés.

I felt sympathy for you when you said that you would destroy every single human.
