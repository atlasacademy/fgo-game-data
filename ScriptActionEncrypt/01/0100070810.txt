＠Gilgamesh
Fwahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Stop, stop already, you fools!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
There's no way I could record a story like that for posterity! So, first you swatted her out of the sky, and then you tied her up!?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
And then, after you released her out of sheer pity, she helped you escape, and fled home?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Ishtar's actually entertaining this time! I think I'll have to give her a speck of credit now!
[k]

？1：Your Majesty, I think you're laughing too much.

[charaFace C 3]
＠Gilgamesh
Hm, true. It's unlike me to waste my time being amused over some goddess.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
You've done a fine job this time. I'm sure it was a good lesson for Ishtar too.
[k]

？2：Is Ishtar really an enemy of mankind?

[charaFace C 5]
＠Gilgamesh
Of course she is. She will always be an enemy of mankind. Even if by some fraction of a chance she changed,
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
her existence itself sends the world into chaos. That's just the nature of her divinity.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
She's the seed of conflict. She incites war, inspires greed, and torments mankind.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
She's a hopeless idiot, but she's not evil at her core. That's why she is such a nuisance.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
If she were just completely evil from head to toe, I would have no qualms about destroying her.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
That's right. They've been surviving by locking themselves inside their walls while under siege by Demonic Beasts.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Those beasts have a set attack cycle. They're not exactly demons immune to hunger and exhaustion.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
We've been evacuating the citizens of Nippur little by little in between their attacks. However, their supplies have finally run out.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
They cannot hold out any longer. Therefore, we must evacuate any remaining survivors immediately.

In that respect, they're no different from humans. I mean that they don't fight all day and all night.

＠Gilgamesh
Take an Ušumgallu, for example. It could take as many as ten soldiers to bring one down...
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
However, it doesn't have much in the way of stamina. According to legend, it could run thousands of miles in a day. But, if you study it, that seems unlikely.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
An Ušumgallu can only maintain its maximum speed for about a minute. After that, it slows down and must feed.

＠Dr. Roman
Ah, you're talking about burning calories. There's also muscle fiber and blood vessel endurance.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's the same with cheetahs. The fastest animal on Earth, they can get up to speeds of eighty kilometers per hour in a space of about two seconds.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But it turns out that kind of high performance can be dangerous. Maintaining that speed for more than about ten seconds could burn up their brains.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's why cheetahs always chase their prey for under ten seconds, and burn incredible amounts of calories doing it.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If it can take down its prey, the cheetah wins. But if the prey can evade the cheetah for more than ten seconds, the prey wins.

＠Gilgamesh
Not bad, you catch on quick. Precisely, a Demonic Beast is not that much different than any other creature.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Gilgamesh
On the other hand, a Mušḫuššu doesn't have much combat power, but it has incredible endurance. It can be active for a whole day without feeding.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
So you see, Demonic Beasts all have special traits. Usually they never fight alongside each other.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
However, there's probably someone commanding them all. The commander brings them together and they come to attack once every seven days.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
It may not be on the dot, but we estimate the timing, and send our strongest against them.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
That was all thanks to Tomoe's work too. ...Hmph. [charaFace C 4]She may have been mixed-blood, but she was a fine warrior.

Right. The other day, Ushiwakamaru and Benkei fought against the Demonic Beasts' attack.

There will be no attacks for another six days. During this pause, lead the people of Nippur to the Northern Wall!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
If you manage this, I shall take back what I said about you being unnecessary!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
As the protector of the Foundation of Humanity, you may become my proxy!
