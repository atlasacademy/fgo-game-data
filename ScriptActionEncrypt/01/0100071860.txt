...The time has finally come. I have been awaiting this moment with bitter anticipation for six months.

＠Gilgamesh
Tiamat, the Mother of All Beasts. What's beyond this mythical battle is something even I cannot foresee.

Will you swallow the world, or will humanity be worthy of flourishing...

[charaFace H 5]
＠Gilgamesh
It's time to see that question answered. Let the final battle of the Age of Gods begin!
