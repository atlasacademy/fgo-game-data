[line 3]Oh? In other words, you wish to fight with us?
[k]

？1：Yes.
？2：Oui.

？！

[charaFace E 2]
＠Cursed Arm
Hahaha. What an unusual request. We're refugees struggling just to survive each day, see?
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
Do you think such folk would fight the Lion King's forces?

An unexpected reply from Hassan, Senpai!

...Sorry. I'm just joking. Indeed, we are awaiting an opportunity to launch a counterattack against the Lion King.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
Each hidden village has an “Old Man of the Mountain” with his own ideas, gathering his forces.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
Listen. We must never succumb to the Lion King.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Cursed Arm
He belittles our gods... He declared that the laws of the Holy City override the authority of any and every god.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
That can never be forgiven. On top of that, he obliterates opposition without question.

The ruthlessly excavated lands... You must have seen them too...

...Hmm, I wonder about that. But no matter. We must fight. We must resist.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
In order to do that, we do need more fighting power. However...
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
I can't possibly just up and accept you. Least of all with two Knights of the Round, even if they are rebels.
[k]

？1：You saw through Mash, too!

[charaFace E 3]
＠Cursed Arm
Ha. It's obvious when you're as experienced a Servant as we are. Isn't that right, Lord Arash?

However! If you are a demon that surpasses our principles, someone with so much skill that we must rely on you, then it's a different matter!

To destroy a demon, one must be prepared to use a demon!

＠Cursed Arm
If you are a force that can rival the Knights of the Round, I, Cursed Arm, will gladly become your dog!

Prove it to me now! Here goes, Lord Arash! No holding back!
