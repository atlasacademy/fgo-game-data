Your Servant blocked that Noble Phantasm attack. However, its shockwave knocked everyone unconscious.

While our lives were spared,[sr]it appears that we are in their custody now.

You can run away if you like... But, the bad news is that these babies will target the Master, aggressively.

...That's a misunderstanding. I will kill a Master first depending on the situation.
[k]

＠Karna
Of course, first you must show me that you have the reason, conviction, and determination to convince me to kill a Master.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Karna
For instance, is the one issuing the order willing to exchange their own life for it?
[k]

＠Karna
If that's the case, I am willing to consider.

First, I'll have you meet my king.[sr]You should decide which side to be on after that.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
Well, I know the two Servants sitting right there won't side with us that easily. That much I'm sure of.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
However, I'm sure things will be different if we can persuade the Master.

＠Blavatsky
Your name is Mash, right? In light of your proper manners, I shall answer you.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
The biggest reason why I support the king is that we were closely connected when we were alive.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Blavatsky
Oh, it's not like we had an affair or anything like that. We kept in close contact, and I owe him a lot...
[k]

＠Blavatsky
The Celts who dominate the East won't accept anyone other than themselves.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Blavatsky
Even if I surrendered to the Celts, they would just kill me. Or maybe they would sacrifice me for the sake of their war.

If that's the case, we'll be seeing a lot of Celtic Servants this time.

As far as I know from the legends, they all have a few screws loose. They're a bunch of airheaded Berserkers!

Hey, are you keeping a fairy in your pocket or something? Nothing? Then, just where did that voice come from...

[charaFace B 5]

Oh. Is Graham Bell with you or something?

[charaFace B 4]

If he were, the king would seriously lose his temper this time.

Apologies for introducing myself so late, Ms. Blavatsky. I'm their navigator.

＠Blavatsky
So, let's get back to the subject. You all get it now, right?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Blavatsky
You can't win in this war unless you side with somebody. It will only get you killed if you try to take on both sides.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
This world maintains a precarious balance as the East and West continue to fight.
[k]

＠Blavatsky
If we didn't fight, this nation would have been completely destroyed and beyond salvation by now, you see?
[k]

？1：So both sides just like to fight?

[charaFace B 4]
＠Blavatsky
Dear, you're not a good listener, are you? Has anyone called you stubborn before?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Blavatsky
Well, at any rate, you should meet the king at least once... It'll be amusing.
[k]


？2：So what are we, really?

[charaFace B 0]
＠Blavatsky
Oh. I see. So I hadn't gotten around to explaining that yet. But... Heh heh.
