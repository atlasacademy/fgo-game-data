＠Da Vinci
Ah. So to put it simply...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The point of Holy Selection is to select humans... Those who won't stray from the path of righteousness no matter what kind of evil has invaded their hearts.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
To gather people of Lawful-Good alignment into the Holy City Camelot, then absorb Camelot into Rhongomyniad...
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
...thereby creating a sort of space colony that can continue to exist no matter what kind of isolation it is in.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
In which case, it would be able to withstand the King of Mages' incineration. ...That's the Lion King's goal, yes?
[k]

Bedivere, you can say it.[sr]Lancelot was wrong.

[charaFace B 3]
＠Bedivere
Hm? N-No...I don't want to attack him while he's down...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Sanzang
Right. You're so kind. I like that kind of person.[sr]In that case, I'll continue for you.

＠Sanzang
The Lion King had the wrong idea. It's not good to take people's choices away from them.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Sanzang
But all of the Knights of the Round Table accepted that idea... albeit at the cost of their own identity.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Sanzang
That's because they believed in the past King Arthur. However, the current King Arthur is no longer the same.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Sanzang
Right? Why did King Arthur become the Lion King?
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.1]

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Lancelot
...That I don't know. At the time we were summoned, the king was already in that form.
[k]

＠Lancelot
There's also no indication that His Majesty's heart was invaded by the one you call the King of Mages.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Lancelot
There were knights who disobeyed, saying he had gone mad... But really, there was no reason for him to do so.

＠Da Vinci
...It's not madness. I mean, the current King Arthur doesn't even have any sense of reason to begin with.
[k]

＠Lancelot
No sense of reason... Are you calling His Majesty a puppet!? One that's controlled by Agravain!?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Agravain? ...Oh, King Arthur's aide.[sr]Saruhan mentioned something about him...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
About how Agravain took over the merchant's guild and lined his own pockets while using his role as royal aide as cover.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
Hmm. Well regardless of what Agravain was thinking,[sr]I can explain why King Arthur became the Lion King.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
She is no longer human, no longer a Heroic Spirit. Her very existence changed from holding onto the sacred lance for too long.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Lancelot
Her existence... has changed?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Yes. She was originally a legend born on this earth, but through the sacred lance, she became one that sits in the heavens.

＠Da Vinci
If she had any sense of normal reason, she would focus on improving life in the ideal city she aimed to build.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But she didn't choose that, she didn't even think of that.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
In order to maintain this everlasting world of man she envisions, she turned down all human happiness.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This was a transcendent viewpoint that went beyond being coolheaded. She honestly believed this.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
“Mankind is something of value. However, human life has no value.”
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
The result was the Holy City. Truly a god's perspective. That is what I meant by having no sense of reason.

＠Dr. Roman
...So her existence changed. That's believable. So the King Arthur who manifested in this Singularity is, rather than a Heroic Spirit...
[k]

＠Lancelot
A Divine Spirit... One of the gods...

But why! Why did it turn out that way?

[charaFace D 4]

King Arthur was trying to bring peace to Britain, to bring happiness to all its people.

Why did the King of Knights turn out like that!?

＠Dr. Roman
We'll talk about King Arthur's transformation later. The situation is too dangerous.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Not only was that era already in ruins, but building a human world without humanity?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If that's the case, even if we beat Solomon and prevent his machinations, the history of mankind will be a mess.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
The Lion King's sacred lance... The Holy City Camelot will be a cancer even after humanity is restored.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Whatever happens, we have to stop the Lion King...

That's impossible. Sir Lancelot, you received a Gift from the Lion King, didn't you?
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
If so, the instant you turn your sword on the king, you will be burned away. ...I didn't want to say it, but, well...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
The moment they accepted their Gifts, the Knights of the Round Table lost their ability to turn on the king.

That mighty skeleton guy said he would come to the battlefield, but that alone wouldn't be enough to beat the Lion King's armies.
[k]

＠Sanzang
The difference in the forces is too great...[sr]Plus there's the Light of Judgment too.
[k]

＠Sanzang
...Attacking as we are now would be suicide.[sr]And suicide is absolutely out of the question.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

I don't mind doing it myself, but to have it done in front of me by someone else would drive me to tears.

？！

[charaFace B 9]

[%1]?

If the Lion King is left alone, Egypt will disappear too. He would know that.
