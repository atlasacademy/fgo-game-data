...It looks to be an abandoned fort.[sr]Let's rest here for now.

How is Siegfried's wound?

My Noble Phantasm can heal wounds, just a bit.[sr]But not this one, it seems.

＠Siegfried
It seems that I was summoned relatively early.
[k]

＠Siegfried
I was drifting without a Master...[sr]That's when I saw the town being attacked.

So you went to rescue them?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Siegfried
Yes... Though it's not like when I was alive.[sr]Still, with Balmung, I managed somehow.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Siegfried
When you're attacked by multiple Servants, it's not easy to pull off.
[k]

＠Siegfried
...Then one of them hid me in the castle. My wound[sr]wouldn't heal, and I couldn't ask anyone for help either.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

I had no choice but to wait.

Was it a woman who could control a dragon?
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Siegfried
Dragon? No, it was a turtle... No, a dragon... A dragon[sr]turtle... Now that you mention it, is it possible for that kind of dragon to exist?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Siegfried
Oh. She had the aura of a Ruler, similar to what you have.

So that's St. Martha, the one who drove off the evil dragon Tarasque. I want to thank her[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...
[k]

＠Siegfried
I see, then never mind.[sr]I am sure she's prepared for the worst.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

Still, I feel guilty that she saved me when I was useless.

Baptism Rites could probably remove this curse. But, a Servant of considerably high rank must perform it[line 2]
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Jeanne, you can do that, can't you?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
...No. I tried, but my power alone isn't enough.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
Multiple curses have been put on Siegfried.[sr]...It's a miracle he's even alive.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
We need another Saint to remove multiple curses at once.

A Servant who was a saint... Hmm?

If St. Jeanne d'Arc...[sr]Sorry, Jeanne the "Dragon Witch" has the Holy Grail.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
There is a possibility[line 2]that a Saint was summoned[sr]as the result of the Counter Force.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
St. Martha was actually summoned, right?[sr]Do you guys know any Saint Servants to ask?

...Staying together is probably safer, but maybe it be better if we split up?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Unless we remove the curses on "Dragon Slayer"[sr]Siegfried, we can't defeat Fafnir can we?
[k]

＠Jeanne
But...
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
Jeanne?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
Oh, well.[sr]...It's nothing.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
You are right. I think that's a reasonable idea.[sr]What do you think, [%1]?
[k]

？1：Let's look for that Saint.

？2：Break into teams and look around France.

"Fortunately" may not be appropriate to say, but the[sr]French territories have already been reduced to less than half.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Searching them should be easy.[sr]How to split up is the problem...
