What the hell is this?

＠Mash
...Almost identical to the Fuyuki Greater Grail.[sr]Incredible magical energy.
[k]

＠Mash
So much magical energy, I can feel it strongly even in the[sr]Demonic Fog. Such a giant Magical Reactor Core...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I can observe it here, too. This is amazing.[sr]No doubt about it, "that's" what's creating the Fog.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Mordred
I've never seen a machine this big.[sr]Angrboda... The name of a giant fits perfectly.

Oddly enough, it is just as Paracelsus said.[sr]Evil must be stopped by those who do good.

＠D：???
The Massive Steam Engine, Angrboda.[sr]This is our evil embodied, but it is also our hope.

Your path ends here.[sr]Good will now be destroyed by our evil.

I thought you'd stand with us,[sr]but it seems you're now a hero of good. Ironic.

I am Makiri Zolgen.[sr]The first leader of this "Project Demonic Fog."

＠Makiri
One mage seeking the annihilation of this era[line 3]the[sr]Fourth Singularity, by releasing Demonic Fog all over England.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
All of England!? So it's not just London![sr]That's...I have to say, going to be tough...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Makiri
Destroying London alone isn't enough. Only by[sr]destroying this era completely can I erase the Foundation of Humanity.
[k]

＠Makiri
That is our King's wish, and an act which[sr]we had no choice but to embrace after our surrender.

There's no need to say another word.[sr]Angrboda is shifting to overload mode.
[k]

＠Makiri
A powerful Heroic Spirit, one sufficient to truly awaken[sr]the Demonic Fog that fills the city, will now materialize.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Makiri
A single strike from him shall activate the Demonic Fog,[sr]engulfing the world. "Everything" will meet its end.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Makiri
Now, behold. The Heroic Spirit we desire[sr]shall appear from the Demonic Fog shortly.
[k]

＠Makiri
A Pioneer of the Star, fitting for the end of the Myth of[sr]Humanity. Or perhaps, this planet's glimmer[line 3]

Just a hunch. I told you they're usually right, remember?[sr]He's human.
[k]

＠Mordred
I don't know if he's rightfully from this era, or "shifted"[sr]like Babbage was.

[charaFace A 2]

Why are you doing this, Makiri Zolgen?[sr]Why are you destroying the era you live in[line 3]

Of course, I tried to resist.[sr]But I realized everything was useless.

＠Makiri
Even if I wished for the salvation of all humanity,[sr]the world where they should live has already been incinerated.
[k]

＠Makiri
Past, present, and future.[sr]Our King has decided not to allow them to exist.
[k]

＠Makiri
[line 3]All will be destroyed before it is achieved.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Makiri
The King has proclaimed to us that he tires[sr]of seeing more of this ugliness and existence.
[k]

＠Makiri
Then, before long...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Makiri
No, there's nothing left to say.[sr]With the power of our King I shall destroy you.
