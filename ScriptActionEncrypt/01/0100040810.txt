＠Mordred
...You know. You said "a large group,"[sr]but we can't count you in during combat.

[charaFace G 1]
＠Jekyll
You're looking for the ruins of the Mage's Association,[sr]yes? Surely my intellectual curiosity as a scholar will be aroused.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Jekyll
Besides, I can be good when need to.[sr]You see, I also have an "ace up my sleeve."
[k]

＠Jekyll
And I have faith that you'll all protect me.[sr]I'm counting on you, Saber.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Mordred
Tch. As I said, I'm not protecting anyone.[sr]But do as you like.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
All right then. We really should get moving. The British[sr]Museum means we're heading to the Regent Park area.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's some distance from here. You'd best[sr]prepare yourselves for a succession of battles.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Mmm?[sr]Come to think of it[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Didn't the Mage's Association exist as several[sr]college towns in the London suburbs and stuff?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Jekyll
That's that. This is this.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Jekyll
The Mage's Association originated at their London HQ,[sr]and added facilities centuries later as they grew in scale.
[k]

＠Jekyll
That's why interspersed college towns center around[sr]London, as it's the heart of Mage's Association and Clock Tower.
[k]

＠Jekyll
Multiple cities built to surround London[sr]comprise the rest of the Association.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Jekyll
Doctor, have you never been to the Clock Tower before?

Oh. I knew there was something unpolished about you.[sr]Are you a country bumpkin?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Gulp. N-No, of course not.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's just that I haven't had much connection to London,[sr]I mean, being so far away...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
B-But I knew what was going on in London! Director[sr]Marie was sent from the Mage's Association, too!

They didn't waste any time. Fight your way[sr]through them and get to Regent Park on the double!

？！

Yes, Master!
