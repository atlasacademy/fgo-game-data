...I'm glad that you trust me, but do you think I can guard against it?
[k]

＠Mash
...I've heard about the Sword of King Arthur.[sr]My fingers are trembling, it seems too much for me...
[k]

＠Caster
Well, you'll just have to overcome it with courage. But[sr]from where I stand, you seem to be perfect for the job.

＠Caster
That shield will never shatter, if you were to lose, it would be because the young lady messed it up.
[k]

＠Caster
If you let go of that shield, your Master behind it will evaporate instantly.
[k]

＠Caster
Listen, don't think about beating the Sword.[sr]All you need to think about is protecting your Master.

Well, anyway. Leave it to me to finish off Saber,[sr]and just do what you need to do.
