Well, how about it, Da Vinci!?[sr]How do you think [%1]'s doing!?

＠Dr. Roman
The Singularity was a good deal more difficult this time around. Nobody expected this would turn out to be a battle against an actual military force.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[%1] could've run away, or hidden.[sr]But [&he didn't:she didn't] give up.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[&He's:She's] got a long way to go yet as a mage, but as a Master [&he's:she's] doing well.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
At this rate, it won't be long until [&he:she] becomes Chaldea's most famous Master.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Da Vinci
You look so proud. It's good to see you putting your trust in others.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But are you sure about this?[sr]Shouldn't we tell them... something, at least?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
There are many kinds of secrets, but yours is basically a lie of omission at this point.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If you think about it logically, when the truth about the relationship between you and the previous director comes to light, [%1] might hate you.
[k]

[charaFace C 10]
＠Dr. Roman
Uh... Well, yeah. Still, I can't tell them.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Dr. Roman
If the man claiming to be Solomon really is Solomon, that very secret will be our trump card.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But if the enemy learns the truth, and has time to prepare... we'll lose our advantage. I won't tell[sr][%1] even to the very end.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Da Vinci
I see. Well, I guess that makes sense. It really is only effective if the enemy doesn't know. If that's what you've decided, I suppose I'll play along.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Dr. Roman
That would be helpful, thank you.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's not that I don't trust [%1].[sr]It's just, considering the circumstances...

[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Dr. Roman
But I'm glad [&he:she] came to Chaldea.[sr]A normal person, and not a mage.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Yeah. Da Vinci, instead of a prominent genius like you saving humanity,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
it would be better for an ordinary, purehearted person like [&him:her] to save the world, with the help of those around [&him:her]...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Wouldn't that be more of a display of mankind's worth and value?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's what King Solomon believed.[sr]And I think so, too.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]
＠Dr. Roman
Though... King Solomon and I are practically different people at this point. After all, he didn't have any human sentiments.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Da Vinci
...? What does that mean? Are you saying he was cold and heartless until the end?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Dr. Roman
No, it's something far simpler.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You see, every hero starts off human.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They might have the blood of a god, or be the subject of a prophecy, but few are ever born heroes.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
First, they live human lives. They live as normal people until something pushes them beyond that, and they become true heroes[line 2]and become inhuman.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Da Vinci
That's right. Sure, I was born a genius, but I lived a quiet life until I was old enough to make my own decisions.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It felt natural[line 2]good, even[line 2]to be praised as a genius, but the experiences of my youth were irreplaceable.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Once you become a hero, you're no longer free.[sr]True freedom only lasts for as long as you're human.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That's true for all Heroic Spirits.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Da Vinci
...Wait a minute. Are you saying King Solomon...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Yeah, you got it. There was never a time when Solomon was human.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
From birth, he was treated as a king who could hear the voice of God. The people wanted him to be king, and so he became one.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He was said to be a king of many loves, but in truth, they were all desired by the people around him, not for his own sake.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He was not free for a single second of his life.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He may have had the power to see everything, but he was forbidden to give his own opinions on anything.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Solomon was more a mechanism than a man, one made by God and mankind to better their great kingdom.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's nothing humane about him at all.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He died without ever really experiencing the world as a man. He was never afforded the freedom that is “humanity.”
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Da Vinci
So that's why you wished to be human.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You can't interact with the real world as a Heroic Spirit. That's why many Servants wish to be incarnated.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Solomon didn't want to rule again.[sr]He just wanted to be human.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He wanted to know what human freedom was like so badly... He wanted what every other Heroic Spirit experienced in life.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Yes. And so he was reborn... as me.[sr]King Solomon's wish was granted!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
My time as Romani Archaman has been wonderful.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
My Magical Circuits were gone, my Clairvoyance was gone, and I was able to be truly free and live however I wished!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Dr. Roman
This time I've had, it's been like a dream.[sr]It was exactly what I wanted.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Da Vinci
...
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Da Vinci
By the way, how'd you get the nickname “Roman”?[sr]Was it a coincidence?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Dr. Roman
No way. Of course it meant something.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
People in King Solomon's day didn't have the mental flexibility humans do now.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They could think as a society, but not really as individuals... There wasn't much individualism.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Many people could think freely if given the chance, but the basic mentality was that everyone obeyed the laws laid down by God.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...So, when I learned the word “romance,” I was surprised, and even delighted.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The freedom to dream of a future, the ambition to look for a better tomorrow... to know that the people who come after us would be capable of these things...
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Dr. Roman
I'm not entirely comfortable with the fact that the word “romance” comes from the word “Rome,” but that doesn't really matter.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Even the mighty Rome that threatened Israel in the days of King Herod is gone now.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The world of man changes. And if, in the midst of those changes, good things grow, so be it.
[k]

[charaFace C 01]
＠Dr. Roman
Well, anyway, I liked the idea so much, I wanted people to call me Roman!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Dr. Roman
When I became human, I wished to live like that from the bottom of my heart!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Da Vinci
...Sheesh. When you say it like that, I don't have the heart to make fun of you for it.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Da Vinci
But... are you sure? If you go down this path, you'll lose that freedom of yours.

As long as [&he:she] becomes a good Master, there will have been meaning in my time here.

I could ask for no greater reason for this human existence. It more than makes up for the freedom I could have had.

The decade you've spent...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You spent all that time working yourself to the bone, desperately trying to escape from and avert the end of mankind that you saw when you became human.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
There was no romance there. Only a nightmarish existence, a hellish freedom. But it was indeed worth it.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...Yeah. King Solomon never really got his wish to live as a human.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
