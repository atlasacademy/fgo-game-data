I've detected a single, large unit.[sr]Easy to make out. It's too large to be human!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
I doubt it's a large vehicle.[sr]Mash, do you sense anything?

...I can hear machinery operating. It's large!

＠Dr. Roman
It would have been a rather romantic story if Britain's[sr]secret service had arranged for a special vehicle...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...or if this era's Mage's Association had sent a[sr]mechanical golem to save the citizens of London.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 2]
＠Dr. Roman
I doubt that's the case here! It's clearly an enemy,[sr]and it's approaching you!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
Master, be on your guard.[sr]It's probably a new type of enemy.
[k]

？1：Let's fight cautiously.

？2：Mash, we just have to take our chances!

？！

＠Mash
...Yes!
