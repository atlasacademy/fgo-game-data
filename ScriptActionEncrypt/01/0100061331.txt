That's right, I am Xuanzang Sanzang!

＠Sanzang
With the guidance of the Buddha, I've materialized in this world. My class? Caster, of course!

Not much of a reaction, huh?[sr]Well, no matter, I'll continue.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I was summoned somewhere in this world about half a year ago. Following the Buddha's guidance, I traveled the Silk Road and ended up here.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Sanzang
Of course, I'm here to stop the unprecedented crisis happening here in the Holy Land.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Honestly, this is all nothing but trouble for me. In Heroic Spirit form I'm still technically on my way back from Tianzhu, after all...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Sanzang
However, guidance is guidance... So I must go.
[k]

＠Sanzang
That's why I'm here! In this forsaken land, this land of endless sandstorms, Shambhala!
[k]

？1：This is in the middle of nowhere.

[charaFace E 2]
＠Sanzang
Yes, I can see that! It means I'm lost!
[k]

？2：This isn't Shambhala.

[charaFace E 3]
＠Sanzang
Wait... really? Huh... That doesn't sound right...
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 1]
＠Sanzang
Well, let's not get caught up in the details.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Let your feelings always be composed, as calm as the River Ganges. Know that that is the way to great enlightenment. Okay?

Xuanzang Sanzang... Monk Sanzang, right? You don't seem like a Servant of the Holy City...

You do seem to be quite temperamental though... Um... Monk Sanzang?

[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Y-You lived in the Holy City!?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Sanzang
Yes. It was such a pleasant place. Everyone was so carefree and happy, and there wasn't a wicked person in sight.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Sanzang
But I didn't feel like I belonged there. So I left. I had other places I wanted to see, too.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

Um... You there. [%1], was it?

[charaFace E 1]

Thanks for helping me just now. And you skeletons, thank you too.

Monk Sanzang is known as the traveling high priest. So it's only natural for me to join you on your journey.

Everything's happening so fast that I can barely keep up, but it's certainly nice to have an increase in fighting power!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Thank you, Monk Sanzang! The assistance of a Servant is an unexpected stroke of luck!

Not a stroke of luck. The Lord Buddha's divine protection.

＠Sanzang
You all have the Lord Buddha's divine protection. That would be... me!

I don't have Wukong, or Bajie, or Wujing, or the White Dragon Horse, nor can I hear the Bodhisattva's voice, but whatever!

I am the high priestess who shall one day become a Buddha, Xuanzang Sanzang!

It makes me feel lonely... Lonely, scared, and helpless.

Touta won't come for me, either... I've called and called, but he won't come at all...

Did you come here on your own? It seems you came from the direction of the desert.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Sanzang
...That's the thing. I actually had one disciple.
[k]

＠Sanzang
A Servant I met a while ago. He was so hopeless that I took him under my wing.
[k]

＠Sanzang
But that idiot... He got captured in front of the Holy City army's fort.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I'm his mentor, so I tried to go back and save him, but then I lost my way and... Oh, this is beyond hopeless...
[k]

？1：Yeah, just... leave that to us, too.
？2：All right, just... leave it all to us.
