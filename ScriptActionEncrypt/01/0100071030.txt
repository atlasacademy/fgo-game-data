＠Ishtar
So, you just waltz right through the front door like you're here on a sightseeing tour, huh, [%1]? Rude!
[k]

＠Ishtar
You just lost to the Goddess of Demonic Beasts, and now you're visiting me?
[k]

[charaFace D 10]
＠Ishtar
...You've got some nerve. I'll give you that.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Not only did you enter Mt. Ebih without my permission, but you defeated my guards and entered my temple.
[k]

[charaFace D 8]
＠Ishtar
Until now, I've overlooked what you've been doing because you're a country bumpkin outsider, but not anymore.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Your shameful acts in Babylon, your favoritism towards Gilgamesh in Uruk, that game of cat-and-mouse in Kutha...
[k]

＠Ishtar
I'm sorry, but as a goddess, I cannot in good conscience allow you to go on like this. The gods have their own rules, and a goddess only forgives three times...

＠Ishtar
What I'm trying to say is that I'm done talking![sr]If you've come here, a fight's what you want, right?
[k]

＠Ishtar
There'll be no amnesty or mercy for you.[sr]It's just as you wished.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I'll make you use all your Command Spells, and then blast you all the way back to Uruk!

...[%1] is right, Mash.[sr]Ishtar does not listen to the words of the weak.
[k]

＠Ana
Let's show her our strength...by breaking her knees. Also, maybe her arms.

No, [%1], there are some things you just shouldn't say!
[k]

＠Merlin
I'm actually of the exact same opinion, but let's try and make our lives easier by flattering Ishtar!

＠Ishtar
I am the goddess of war, and the goddess of Venus! Taste the power of Ishtar, most fearsome of all goddesses!
