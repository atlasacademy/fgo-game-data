＠Mash
...Whew. I don't like to get rough, but with the situation as it is, I have no choice but to interrogate you... Forcefully.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Who are you, where is this ocean, and what's going on?[sr]Would you care to explain?
[k]

＠Pirate
Hey, we have no clue either, see.[sr]Before we knew it, we were afloat around here.
[k]

＠Pirate
Our compasses and maps are completely useless, too.
[k]

＠Pirate
When you've got no clue what's going on, see, you just[sr]attack the prey in front of you, right? It's the pirate's way.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
What? So you had no idea who we were...
[k]

＠Mash
And you didn't know if it's safe to do so,[sr]yet you still attacked us?
[k]

＠Pirate
♪That's right, yo ho♪[sr]♪Because we're pirates♪

＠Mash
...What should we do, Senpai?[sr]He's started to sing like he's in a musical...
[k]

？1：Is he an idiot?

？2：Don't we have other leads?

？！

＠Pirate
I may be an idiot, but I do have some leads.[sr]Word has it, there's a Pirate Island nearby.
[k]

＠Pirate
We're running low on food and water.[sr]I say it's a good idea to try the island...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Pirate...Island?[sr]Um, are there lots of pirates there?
[k]

＠Pirate
Yeah, it IS Pirate Island.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Hmmm.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...For now, we don't have any leads that feel like leads.[sr]We might as well go there.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Understood... Well, everyone, I hereby exercise my rights as victor.
[k]

＠Mash
Please, man the wheel.[sr]Head towards this Pirate Island.
[k]

＠Pirate
Aye, aye, sir!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mash
That would be, "Aye, aye, ma'am!"
