What's going on? You don't feel pain, woman? Or, do you have a heart of iron?

＠Beowulf
Edison's mechanized soldier is more human than you. You're like steel in human clothes, Berserker!

I'm often told that. I don't care at all. My body is simply a means to heal patients, after all.

...Wait.[sr]Nightingale, I have a request.

＠Nightingale
[line 2]You're a patient, please be quiet.

＠Rama
No, this is necessary for my treatment.
[k]

＠Nightingale
...What is it?
[k]

＠Rama
Put me down.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nightingale
...I can't do that.
[k]

＠Rama
Put me down, for the sake of treatment. If you fall, who will treat me?

＠Nightingale
[line 3]Can you even fight?
[k]

＠Rama
Believe in me. A patient and doctor must first trust each other, right?
[k]

＠Nightingale
...Just one correction.[sr]I'm a nurse, not a doctor.

Hey, I want to fight that living iron puppet lady over there.

I have no interest in fighting a living corpse. Just go die in a corner or something.
