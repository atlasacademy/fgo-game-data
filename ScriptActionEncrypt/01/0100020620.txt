＠Mash
[line 2]So that's the story.[sr]I think we'll be in your care for a while.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
Oh? From a foreign world?[sr]I see, I guess such things can really happen.
[k]

[se ad13]
[wait se ad13]
＠Dr. Roman
Thank you for your understanding.[sr]Boudica, was it? You're a Servant too, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
...Doctor.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Boudica
It's all right, you don't have to hold your tongue.[sr]Yes, I "should be dead" already.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
I see you find that strange.[sr]How did Queen Boudica become a Roman general, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes.[sr]In the history that I'm aware of, you[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Boudica
Yes, that's right.
[k]

＠Boudica
I'll never forgive Emperor Nero or Rome.[sr]I even swore it to the Celtic gods.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Boudica
...And then I materialized. To this era right after my death, of all things.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Boudica
I thought maybe it was my chance for revenge,[sr]but when I saw Rome overrun by the United Empire...
[k]

＠Boudica
My body moved on its own.[sr]Not for Nero's sake, but for the people who live there.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Boudica
...Or did I feel guilty towards the Londinium fellows, whom I brutally murdered for the sake of my vengeance.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Boudica
I don't really know myself.[sr]But when I think about it, I've always been like that.
[k]

＠Boudica
I think fighting to protect something is just my[sr]personality. That's what seems most natural to me.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Boudica
So my apologies to Nero, who wrongly sees me as a "worthy living opponent," but...
[k]

？1：Are you keeping your Servant status a secret?

？2：Are you keeping your death a secret?

？！

[charaFace G 4]
＠Boudica
Yes, because somehow she's more dangerous than[sr]before. If she becomes overly concerned about me, who knows what she would do.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...Understood.[sr]You're a proper Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Mash
A hero whom others aspire to be. The symbol of[sr]strength used to suppress villainy and save others.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
Nyahaha, I was just doing it on a whim... Although[sr]if that's how I look to you, who am I to disagree?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There aren't many Heroic Spirits who could put it[sr]like that. Queen Boudica, your pride is dazzling.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...Senpai.[sr]Um, are you keeping up with the conversation?
[k]

？1：I don't really get it...

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
I didn't think so.[sr]Sorry, I'll explain.
[k]

？2：Yes, it's okay. I understand.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Right.[sr]Ms. Boudica is, um...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...She's a Heroic Spirit, a Servant. She was[sr]killed by Nero's army just before this era.
[k]

＠Mash
She was the Queen of Britannia, which was[sr]overrun by Rome. Now she stands with Nero.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I do have a question, though.[sr]I mean, why[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Boudica
It's not that difficult.[sr]I dislike the United Empire more than Nero.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Boudica
You feel the same way, don't you Spartacus?[sr]You intend to fight a legion of oppressors.
[k]

＠Boudica
It's dangerous to say this, but she isn't the enemy.[sr]You don't consider yourself to be Nero's ally, do you?
[k]

[charaFadein H 0.1 0]
＠Spartacus
Hahaha, the walls of the colosseum have fallen.[sr]Soon, all of this land shall become my colosseum.
[k]

＠Boudica
You see?
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
(I don't.)
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
(I wonder if she possesses a special skill.[sr]Like Madness Comprehension...or something?)
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
A-Anyway.[sr]Both of them are Heroic Spirits and Servants.
[k]

＠Mash
Just like in Orleans, right?[sr]In a singularity, multiple Servants will materialize.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
But not all of them are enemies. Some have wills[sr]of their own and stand on the side of justice.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Boudica
You're embarrassing me.[sr]I'm not all that.
[k]

[charaFadeout G 0.1]
[charaFace H 3]
[charaFadein H 0.1 0]
＠Spartacus
Hahaha! Behold, this muscular body is proof of the[sr]uprising. The oppressors shall know any injuries inflicted are my strength.
[k]

[charaFadeout H 0.1]
[charaFace G 1]
[charaFadein G 0.1 0]
＠Boudica
There, you see?[sr]Spartacus is embarrassed, too.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...Senpai, did you understand what he said?
[k]

？1：I got the gist.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Huh?[sr]R-Really?
[k]

？2：Not one bit!

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
I-I didn't think so.[sr]I didn't catch any of it either...
[k]

？！

[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
[line 2]All right, shall we get started then?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Excuse me?
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Boudica
I don't doubt your skills, but...[sr]Ah, actually, maybe I do.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Boudica
Right now, the United Empire controls most of Gaul.[sr]Not even we can drive them out.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Boudica
The ruler of Gaul[line 2][sr]One of the "emperors," is strong.
[k]

＠Boudica
There's nothing excessive about him, body or mind.[sr]He's a top-notch hero in both looks and skills.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Boudica
Do you have the strength to fight him head-on?[sr]Or should I use you as back-up?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
My apologies, but could I put your abilities to the test?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
What? I thought you were a rational queen, but it[sr]turns out you're a hero who "speaks" with her sword!
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Boudica
Ahaha, now you've got the idea.[sr]So, shall we?
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_2 0.4]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Boudica
Just try not to die. When we're done,[sr]I'll whip up something delicious for you.
[k]

＠Boudica
Of course I mean Britannia cuisine, not Roman.[sr][line 2]So, let's meet face to face and cross swords!
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠Boudica
My True Name is Boudica, class Rider![sr]Be careful, because my chariot is extremely strong!
