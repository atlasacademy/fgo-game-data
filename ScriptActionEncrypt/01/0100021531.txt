But...is it over?[sr]Have you obtained that Holy Grail[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

Yes, we've obtained the Holy Grail.[sr]This concludes our mission.

Thank you very much, Nero Claudius.

Mash, your toes are looking faint![sr]Don't tell me you're going to vanish too!

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nero
...I had a feeling.[sr]My intuition is pretty sharp, you see.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
You're going to disappear like Altera,[sr]my uncle, and the Holy Progenitor.

Boudica, will you, as well?[sr]Jing Ke, Lu Bu, Spartacus?
[k]

[k]

＠Mash
This era will be restored. Your memories[sr]of fighting the United Empire will no longer exist.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
That's a sad thing.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

Yes, it is...

＠Nero
I will no longer doubt you.[sr]I believe you, but this is a problem.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Nero
It's unfortunate, I haven't given you any reward.
[k]

＠Nero
You could have been more than my retainers.[sr]Something more[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Nero
No, no sense in saying it. [%1],[sr]you will find yourself heading to Rome.
[k]

＠Nero
All roads lead to Rome, for Rome is the world.[sr]Both the Holy Progenitor and I believe so.

So I will not say goodbye.[sr]Only thanks.

I'll explain. The Grail is the law that decides[sr]how magical energies in a dimension is used.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Think of it as a world's rules. It normally[sr]doesn't have a form, but Lev crystallized it into one.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We can't analyze its workings, but we can seal it away.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

I fiddled with Mash's shield a little, and created a space for the Grail.

Yes. The best place for a relic is in a relic, I figure.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It can only hold one at a time, so I yank it out after each retrieval. Got it?

This is our second Grail and we've also achieved our original goal of finding Lev.
[k]

？1：But Lev is[line 3]

？2：I didn't learn anything...

？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
...That's right. Altera killed him,[sr]and we never found out what his plans were.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...You mean why he betrayed mankind[sr]and tried to...destroy it?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
That's right. We still don't know anything,[sr]but still have five singularities left.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Lev spoke of "Gods." In other words,[sr]there are other enemies out there just like him.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
What that means at this point, we don't know.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
All we can do is recover the Grails one by one, and restore the Singularities.
[k]

？1：Leave the next Grail to me!

？2：We've got a long way to go.

？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Good answer.[sr]I'm counting on you, [%1].
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We don't have that much time, but for tonight try and rest well.

[charaFace B 0]

You walked a long way.[sr]You'll want a good massage, I'm sure.

[charaFace A 8]

...Yes. Our parting with Nero was so sudden.[sr]I feel bad about leaving her...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Even if it ended up never happening, in that last moment, she was alone.
[k]

＠Mash
She defeated the people she respected, and said goodbye to her rivals[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
She was left all alone in that huge empire with no one to rely on.
[k]

It was a hard battle, yes. We almost[sr]died many times, and I'm still scared of fighting.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

But[line 3][sr]it was a fun journey.
[k]

＠Mash
Partially thanks to Nero's glamour, but...[sr]It was a lot of fun.
[k]

？1：I'm sure it was fun for Nero, too.

Yes, you need to take care of yourself.[sr]Shall I give you a massage?
