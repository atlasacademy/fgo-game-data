I thought they would be somewhat useful[line 3][sr]But they spoiled my fun as they couldn't even clean house.

Stupidity. Such stupidity.[sr]Humans really do degrade with the passage of time.

I was not born a mage[sr]but as a petty Caster I can understand.

＠Shakespeare
This magical energy is infinite. This domination[sr]crushes its surroundings merely by existing.

Truly, truly a created being worthy of being called God![sr]No, perhaps it is even God itself!

I see. Like me, only your voice reaches them.
[k]

＠C：???
Chaldea is isolated from the temporal axis,[sr]and so it's become a base that no one can find.
[k]

＠C：???
My eyes see everything[line 3]and all possible futures,[sr]but even they have trouble perceiving Chaldea.
[k]

＠C：???
That's why you survive.[sr]Pathetically, shamelessly, and uselessly.
[k]

＠C：???
Intolerant of a history of destruction already decided,[sr]a pitiful boat still adrift in the sea of void.
[k]

＠C：???
That is what you are, Chaldea,[sr]and what you are, [%1].
[k]

＠C：???
A stain upon the scorched ashes of human history.[sr]The name of the only fools left who would defy "my" deeds.

＠C：???
But very well. I've taken a liking to your stupidity.[sr]If you wish to ask, I shall answer you.
[k]

＠C：???
I am the final destination you seek. The one who[sr]commands the 72 Demon Gods, and will destroy humanity from his throne.
[k]

＠C：???
My name is Solomon. Among the Heroic Spirits,[sr]I stand above them all as one of the "Grand" seven.

...Yes, I'm sure.

＠Mash
He said he was Solomon... Same as the king of ancient[sr]Israel, who was alive in the 10th century B.C.

＠Dr. Roman
No... Is it really Solomon?[sr]But... But that's impossible[line 3]

＠Solomon
Do not think me the same rank as you incompetents.[sr]After death, I revived by my own power to be a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
D-Did he say... he revived by his own power!?
[k]

＠Solomon
I am a Heroic Spirit, and also a living being.[sr]Thus, no Master commands me.
[k]

＠Solomon
I started this matter of my own will.[sr]In order to eliminate all you humans[line 3]
[k]

＠Solomon
Trash who's continuing along its foolish history.[sr]You are the sole and greatest waste of this universe.
[k]

？1：You think you can do that!?

？2：You can't destroy the world!

？！

＠Solomon
I can. I have the means,[sr]the will, and the reality.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Solomon
Your eras have been swept away already,[sr]by my 72 Demon Gods that cross over time.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Cross over time... So those Demon Gods[sr]really were the demons in the Lemegeton?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But they're nothing like those in folklore![sr]King Solomon's familiars can't be such ugly meat monsters!
[k]

＠Solomon
How sad. You exist at the far end of time,[sr]and yet your interpretation is ancient.
[k]

＠Solomon
The 72 Demon Gods took physical form and were[sr]reborn. That is why they can anchor themselves in any era.
[k]

＠Solomon
The Demon Gods are wedges halting this planet's[sr]rotation. The spiraling band of light in the sky is my Noble Phantasm.

Indeed. That is my Third Noble Phantasm.[sr]"Ars Almadel Salomonis."
[k]

＠Solomon
Each ray in the band carries the same heat as a holy[sr]sword. Light equivalent to weaving together hundreds of millions of the holy sword...
[k]

＠Solomon
...held by King Arthur[line 3]the Servant you played with.[sr]In other words[line 3]an Anti-Humanity Noble Phantasm.

Mash, get a hold of yourself![sr]Stay strong and focus on the enemy!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
No matter who they are, they're a Servant, right!?[sr]So you can win!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Heroic Spirit within you was chosen by the Holy[sr]Grail! He's a Heroic Spirit who won't be outranked by Solomon!

＠D：Solomon
Hah[line 3]the rank of a Heroic Spirit?[sr]Do you really think that matters at all?
[k]

＠D：Solomon
Ignorance is a sin. I thought some knowledge was there,[sr]but your commander seems to be a mage of little worth.
[k]

＠D：Solomon
The only one I've any interest in now[sr]is you, girl with the shield.
[k]

＠D：Solomon
Now let's have a fun little chat.
[k]

＠D：Solomon
I'll do you a special favor. Out of respect for[sr]your pure heart, I'll only summon "four of them."
