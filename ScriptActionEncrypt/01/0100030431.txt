＠Mash
I don't think so...[sr]But Captain Drake is a first-rate pirate.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
She must also have keen intuition.[sr]...P-Probably.
[k]

＠Mash
Don't worry, I've recorded everything just in case.[sr]Not that I'd ever forget...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
It's just a matter of going back the way we came.[sr]Getting separated along the way would be a bigger problem.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
...Oh I know.[sr]Master, let's hold hands.
[k]

＠Mash
It'd be a disaster if we got separated here.[sr]Holding hands would prevent that from happening.
[k]

？1：That's embarrassing...

？2：We don't have to...

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Umm... I understand how you feel,[sr]but this is no time to be embarrassed, Master.
[k]

＠Mash
If we get separated,[sr]we might be wandering in this maze until we die.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
It may be a bit awkward at first,[sr]but better safe than sorry...
[k]

？1：Are you embarrassed too, Mash?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
...N-No comment.
[k]

？2：I'm not embarrassed.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Th-That's fine.[sr]I feel... Slightly embarrassed... I think.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
At any rate, we have now just proven[sr]that holding hands is necessary.

If you'll excuse me.

...That reminds me, back then[line 2][sr]You held my hand like this, too.
[k]

＠Mash
Now, it feels nostalgic.[sr]Even though not much time has passed.

Blood.
[k]

＠Drake
...Well, with my job I'm used to smelling[sr]stuff like this.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Look, the drops form a trail.
[k]

＠Drake
Looks like the wound itself wasn't that bad.[sr]A flesh wound.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
It's our only clue.[sr]We should follow it!
