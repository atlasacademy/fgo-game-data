I would've never guessed that you, his mentor, had failed to notice.

[charaFace E 4]
＠Scáthach
I am not good at dealing with illness. After all, having come this close to being a Divine Spirit, illness has lost its meaning to me.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Scáthach
A straightforward death is something I've long since left behind.
[k]

＠Nightingale
...I don't understand. For one who has traversed death, your expression seems glum?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Scáthach
But of course. I have not traversed death.[sr]Simply, I have overcome it.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Scáthach
Yet that doesn't mean I've transcended death. I am merely a ghost who was left behind by life.

＠Scáthach
What of yourself? In the sense of ghosts or grudges, I believe you're rather close to me?

＠Nightingale
I have simply returned to the present world in my peak form. Which is why I shall treat anyone to the best of my ability.
[k]

＠Nightingale
The fact that I was summoned in itself shows that this world is still in need of “nursing.”

First, the North Army. Elisabeth, Robin, Edison, and Blavatsky.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Then, the South Army. Karna, Rama, Nightingale, [%1], Mash, and myself.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Scáthach
The North Army might just be barely enough to hold them. However, depending on the enemy's number, the South Army can break through their defense.

Hold the North with as few members as possible, and rush into Washington D.C. with the South Army.

Against Celtic warriors led by Servants?[sr]That'll require double as much work as usual...
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

Oh, you can do it with only double? That's amazing, Hermit of the Forest. You've exceeded my expectations.

Ugh, I talked too fast.[sr]Normally, it's impossible even with double the effort...

Not necessarily seeing each other face to face.[sr]For example a song or a letter left behind by someone...

I'm saying we'll come across stuff like that if we survive.[sr]For humans, meeting in person isn't the only way to reunite.
