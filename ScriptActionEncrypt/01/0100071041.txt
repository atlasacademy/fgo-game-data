Yay! Ishtar's off her mountain and all's right with the world! We all made it off Mt. Ebih!

Now, now. It was our first battle together with Ishtar. Let's not think about who or what we fought.

More importantly, Mash, it looks like there's an abandoned house nearby. Let's have you all spend the night there.

Have you ever had the experience of sleeping anywhere outside your bedroom, Ishtar?

If you haven't, feel free to stay up all night and keep watch while we sleep.

＠Ishtar
Sorry, but I've spent plenty of time outdoors. I used to sneak out behind my father's back all the time.

And as long as I have my boat, I'm good.[sr]Sarcasm aside, if you want me to keep watch, I will.

I actually find that reassuring, though.[sr]The goddess Ishtar needs to be cold-hearted.

After all, she's our trump card against Gorgon.[sr]We need her to perform just like she does in the myths.

Even King Gilgamesh recognizes its strength! So when the time comes, you can use it to destroy Gorgon.

＠Dr. Roman
Since that doesn't count as fighting her yourself, it shouldn't violate the pact of the alliance.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Well, I'm told it's a devastating weapon that changes the very terrain itself, so we'll keep it as a weapon of last resort.

You haven't let someone else take over yet?[sr]You really care about your Servants.

[charaFace F 8]

Hmm... Mash is the Servant with the shield, right?[sr]You've had a contract with her for a long time.

[charaFace F 7]
＠Ishtar
It's almost dawn. Nothing good comes from pushing yourself too hard.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The more you push yourself, the more people around you will think it's normal. It's best to do only 80% of what you truly can.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Then again, if you could have done that, you wouldn't be here now. It has to be hard to look like you're fine when you're always at your limit.

I still can't believe you brought ME to your side. It's so unexpected a girl just has to stare a bit, you know?

[charaFace F 6]
＠Ishtar
Or what, was it love at first sight?[sr]Are humans from the future always that filthy?

I know. I'm joking. Sorry, I was just teasing you.

...What was that?[sr]Did you just try and run away from me?

No, you did, didn't you? I saw you start to back away. I've seen it many times.

[charaFace F 4]

...I see. ...Are you scared of me too?

...Really? You're really not scared of me?[sr]You don't hate me because I'm a goddess?

!
[k]

？2：Even if you're a goddess, you're a terrible one.

＠Ishtar
You plan on fighting the Three Goddess Alliance.[sr]What do you really think about them, though?
[k]

＠Ishtar
The Goddess of Demonic Beasts... Well, there's no helping her. She'll never make peace with you.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The Goddess of the Jungle... I don't know much about her. Our cultures are very different; what's good in hers may be evil in ours.
[k]

＠Ishtar
She's the descendant of a different celestial body, after all.
[k]

＠Ishtar
And the third goddess... That's me, obviously...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Ishtar
I won't forgive Mesopotamia for what it's become.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I refuse to accept that you humans abandoned the gods and tried to make your own world.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Ishtar
That's going to bring you nothing but misery. Humans can't escape the suffering of life or the terror of death.
[k]

＠Ishtar
You humans became smarter. Too smart. And all so that you could come to accept the world for what it really is.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Ishtar
But in the Age of Gods, that pain can be lessened, because there are things there that humans can't understand.
[k]

＠Ishtar
You can blame all the bad things, the crazy things, in your life on the gods, and that makes life easier.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I really thought that way of life was a good thing.[sr]I took that blame for tens of thousands of years.
[k]

＠Ishtar
That's why...I joined this alliance. So that “your” world could become “our” world... A world for both gods and humans.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Ishtar
I'm not an enemy of humanity, I'm an enemy of humanity's world. I'm only telling this to you, [%1].
[k]

？1：I didn't realize...
？2：You're actually nice, huh, Ishtar?

？！

[charaFace F 3]

...Th-that's all I wanted to say![sr]F-for tonight, anyway.
