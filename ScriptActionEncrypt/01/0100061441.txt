On to the next one. It seems we are at a stand-still... But that matters not. I have resources and time on my side.

There's no place for us to run in a small space like this!

＠Dr. Roman
Even if we try to go after Agravain directly, doesn't he have a Gift like the other Knights of the Round!?

Without Be[line 2][sr]Lucius, we can't take them down!

It is obvious. To receive a Gift is to enter into a contract with the Lion King... Something akin to becoming his Servant.
[k]

＠Agravain
Such a situation would prove rather inconvenient for me. Because... I would not be able to do anything to the king, right?

It will not, fool. The Enforcement Knights will not stop, even if you kill me.

You will all die down here.[sr]That was decided the moment I arrived.

Death means nothing to me, as it is an inevitability.[sr]Soon, the sacred lance will enter its final phase.

When that happens, this era will...[sr][bgmStop BGM_EVENT_3 1.5][charaFace H 1]What's going on!?

I am the Hassan-i Sabbah of the Serenity, the poisonous flower that blooms at night. As I dance, the wind becomes poison and assassinates the enemy[line 3]

It's meant to be used upwind, but you can see how it works in an airtight underground facility such as this one...
