...Good work.[sr]We drove off the Helter Skelters.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Mmm. Mmm?[sr]Wait... Hold on a second, um... So that means...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[line 3]Helter Skelters?

＠Fou
Fou?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yes. That's it! Actually, I've made[sr]progress on the Helter Skelter analysis!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As expected, they're machines created by technology[sr]unknown to us. I suspect they were built[line 2]with magical energy.

＠Mash
You mean...machines created with a combination[sr]of magecraft and science?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Not exactly. They are made by[sr]magical energy, but they are machines.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I still don't understand the kind of techniques used[sr]but structurally, they're machines. Yet, they were formed by magecraft.

In other words...[sr]Um...
[k]

？1：What do you mean?

[charaFace G 3]
＠Jekyll
I don't really understand...
[k]

？2：Maybe like Noble Phantasms?

＠Dr. Roman
Exactly! Good insight!
[k]

？！

[charaTalk A]

＠Mash
...In other words, they're armaments made of magical[sr]energy, just like Servants' Noble Phantasms, right?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah. They're half-baked mechanical constructions,[sr]which is why I was looking too hard for magecraft-made golem approximations.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Basically, they're Noble Phantasms.[sr]Powerful figures woven from magical energy.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Unlike a sword Noble Phantasm that is a "razor edge,"[sr]Helter Skelters are "fighting machine" Noble Phantasms.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It looks like they operate autonomously, but they're[sr]actually controlled by someone like the Noble Phantasm's owner.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They're a remote-controlled robotic squad, so to say.[sr]All units should stop if we break the acting controller.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Then, considerable exceptions aside, if we beat[sr]the Servant possessing the Noble Phantasm[line 3]

[charaFace A 13]

So Doctor,[sr]where is the Servant who owns the Noble Phantasm?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Uuh, that's right... After all, I wasn't[sr]getting anywhere on my own...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm a medical staff...[sr]Considering that, don't you think I'm doing pretty well?

＠Dr. Roman
Thank you, thank you...[sr][%1]...

Uuh...[sr]I feel so lonely...

What should we do?[sr]If we could trace the magical energy in one shot...

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 0]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Mash
If the example of a remote control is correct,[sr]then maybe we can trace the magical energy back.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Da Vinci, wise in the ways of science and magecraft,[sr]brought up that example, so I imagine it's right.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But with the effect of the Demonic Fog, doing[sr]something subtle like tracing marks of magical energy...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Is not something I can do.[sr]It's rather difficult even with Chaldea's equipment.
