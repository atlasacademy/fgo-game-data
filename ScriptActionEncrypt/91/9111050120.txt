The beast likes the air in this city.[sr]It makes him feel at ease.
[k]

＠
There may not be much good food to go around, but maybe that's why he finds it so easy to take a bite out of whatever he encounters.
[k]

＠
The bright lights are more vivid, and more garish,[sr]than that starry sky he once knew.
[k]

＠
It's not as lonely here as it is under the stars.
[k]

＠
Humans made this place. They permeate every corner[sr]of it. Normally, it would be anathema to him.
[k]

＠
But now, the beast has no choice but to live within it.

The beast growls as if to say “nothing”[sr]and turns his gaze forward.
[k]

＠
Behind him, Master continues to[sr]follow at a respectful distance.
[k]

＠
[&He's:She's] close, but not too close.
[k]

＠
...The beast wonders what would happen if he[sr]suddenly tried to bite Master's head off.
[k]

＠
The answer is simple.
[k]

＠
The clay and paper people would kill him mercilessly,[sr]before he could so much as get near enough to try.
[k]

＠
That's why this distance makes sense. It's the[sr]right decision, both logically and tactically.

The beast heartily agrees.
[k]

＠
But seeing this abomination, he also can't help[sr]but feel proud that it has the same spark as him.
[k]

＠
It is a grotesque man-made Demonic Beast.
[k]

＠
A monster with the freedom to wander anywhere[sr]it pleases because it has no place to call home.
[k]

＠
If there is one thing the Demonic Beast all but shouts,[sr]it is this: “We are strong.”

A single roar, and half of the wolves gathered like familiars around the monster scattered in fear.

＠
The beasts' instincts won out over[sr]their loyalty to their leader.
[k]

So I shall show no mercy to any of my brethren who still remain. They have chosen instead to be my prey!
