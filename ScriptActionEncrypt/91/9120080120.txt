＠Tristan
What a brute. So much so that I nearly lost the melody that has been in my head this whole time.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Tristan
Fortunately, that let me concentrate on the battle.
[k]

＠Tristan
Still, I can hardly believe the pain that even a Servant can feel!
[k]

＠Tristan
No wonder others call this a second life.
[k]

？1：Don't get too hung up on it.

＠Tristan
I will try.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Tristan
I cannot forget that if I become a burden to my Master,[sr]I am a failure as a knight.
[k]

＠Tristan
I shall set my sadness aside.
[k]

？2：If you want to talk...

＠Tristan
Yes, I know I can come to you, Master.[sr]I have no intention of keeping secrets from you.

Good night, Master.[sr]May we both have pleasant dreams.

...I dreamt I became a bird and flew through the air.
[k]

＠
I've always felt that dreams of this sort are philosophical in a way.
[k]

＠
Something about seeking freedom.[sr]Or something like a bird is dreaming about you.
[k]

＠
But that is not possible.
[k]

＠
My name is Tristan. A Knight of the Round Table...[sr]No, I am a Heroic Spirit. A Servant. An Archer.

I open my eyes with conviction.[sr]I know Master is before me.
[k]

＠
Master does not look bewildered.[sr][&He:She] looks straight at me.
[k]

＠
[&He:She] is not strict like my king,[sr]but also not gentle like a saint.
[k]

＠
I was captivated by those intensely human eyes.
[k]

＠
Master, am I dreaming?
[k]

＠
In response, [&he:she] nodded.

I see.[sr]So we're in my dream.
[k]

？1：That's how this usually goes, yeah...
？！

＠Tristan
I see.
[k]

＠Tristan
In brief, this is more the inside of a Servant's mental world than it is a dream.
[k]

＠Tristan
I had no idea that you fought for any purpose other than restoring humanity, whether in or outside Servants' dreams.
[k]

＠Tristan
You work so much, Master.[sr]So hard and so tirelessly.
[k]

？1：Not really.

[charaFace B 2]

＠Tristan
Is that so?
[k]

＠Tristan
But when you do awaken,[sr]please use me as you would a manservant.
[k]

？2：This is actually fun.

[charaFace B 2]

＠Tristan
...What? Your mental fortitude is enough[sr]to cause even me to open my eyes in shock.
[k]

＠Tristan
No...could it be that after so many harsh battles,[sr]you are simply always mentally prepared for more?
[k]

＠Tristan
That is impressive all on its own. I should like to be so strong, but that is a difficult thing to be...

＠Tristan
So this grassy plain is my mental world?[sr]It's peaceful, but boring.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Tristan
...No, I'm being too harsh.
[k]

＠Tristan
If there is some entity lurking in my psyche,[sr]then danger is sure to be nearby.
[k]

＠Tristan
We must cautious, even of something so small as a rabbit. After all, even a tiny, innocent rabbit may turn out to be the dreaded vorpal bunny.
[k]

＠Tristan
Its got sharp...well, it bites HARD! Even the eleventh of our number, Sir Bors, was decapitated by a single attack from the dreaded vorpal bunny.
[k]

＠Tristan
Under the light of the sun, Sir Gawain was forced to use all his strength to hold the rabbit down while Sir Lancelot beat it with Arondight!
[k]

＠Tristan
And then Sir Mordred darted in and kicked it viciously! And Merlin just...kept talking about the king like a broken record.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Tristan
And, finally, we defeated this greatest of foes!
[k]

？1：That's...really a thing?

...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Tristan
My apologies, Master. I may have embellished a bit.[sr]I was just trying to lighten the mood.
[k]

？1：Keep your day job, Tristan.

＠Tristan
How odd...[sr]Sir Bedivere always found that story hilarious.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Tristan
Could it be...that he was faking it?
[k]

？2：I-is that so...?

[charaFace B 2]

＠Tristan
During our next Round Table discussion,[sr]I will definitely try to make Master laugh.

Is that a beast within my heart,[sr]or is it my malicious thoughts given form?

Either way, Master.[sr]Let's fight together.
