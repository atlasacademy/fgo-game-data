＠Bedivere
Good morning, Master.
[k]

＠Bedivere
What do you have planned today?[sr]I shall accompany you, no matter your destination.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Rayshifting?[sr]Perhaps training in the simulator?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Bedivere
After all, I am here on behalf of Miss Mash today.[sr]I will try my very best to be of help to you.
[k]

？1：Wait, what's wrong with Mash?
？2：Now that you mention it...

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Bedivere
Miss Mash is having her medical check today.[sr]I understand she must remain in the exam room all day.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Medical checks are important. As you are aware, Chaldea is isolated from the rest of the world, and located in an extreme environment.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Our bodies and minds are under incredible pressure... We must always be aware of this.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Of course, we face the unprecedented threat[sr]that is the Incineration of Humanity.
[k]

＠Bedivere
And while the flames we face and the biting cold of Chaldea's environment are quite different in nature...
[k]


[charaFace A 4]
＠Bedivere
They can both be said to be exceptionally difficult environments.
[k]

＠Bedivere
That is the challenge that everyone here in Chaldea faces. Yourself included, Master.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Bedivere
As such, frequent checkups are of critical importance. Understood?
[k]

？1：Okay!

[charaFace A 1]
＠Bedivere
Very good.[sr]A most excellent response.
[k]

？2：Thanks for looking out for me.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Bedivere
As such, please ask me for anything. I am your attendant, your butler. I am your Servant today in every possible sense of the word.
[k]

＠Bedivere
How about training in the simulator? Or observing and monitoring the remnants from the Singularities would be appropriate as well.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Bedivere
...
[k]

＠Bedivere
...Battling to gain something is what will lead to further growth for you, Master.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Battles for the sake of the Grand Order...
[k]

＠Bedivere
Or rather, battles to continue your survival,[sr]will eventually wear you down.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Your soul. Your psyche.[sr]Or speaking in modern terms, your nerves.
[k]

？1：Nerves wearing down...
？2：Modern terms? That's more of a medical term.

There is one thing that crossed my mind, Master.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Normally, I wouldn't dare mention something like this to others...but in your particular case...
[k]

＠Bedivere
I'm sure HE would be happy about it,[sr]without a doubt. He is that kind of knight.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Bedivere
While any such approval given would be...ex post facto, unworthy though I am, I shall eventually gain it.
[k]

？1：He?
？2：When you said knight...?

？！

[charaFace A 10]
＠Bedivere
Yes. Actually...
[k]

＠Bedivere
My comrade, the man who is the epitome of freedom,[sr]Sir Tristan, heads out to a certain place in every free moment he has.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Occasionally, I accompany him.[sr]I believe it is a wonderful place to relax.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Bedivere
But please, keep that to yourself...
[k]

？1：I will!

[charaFace A 10]
＠Bedivere
Thank you very much.
[k]

？2：Where is it? The Rec room?

[charaFace A 10]
＠Bedivere
Haha.[sr]Is that where you think it is?
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Bedivere
Let's head over there right away.[sr]I will leave a note for Sir Tristan.
[k]

Let's go!

I accompanied Sir Tristan to watch him go fishing and listen to his ranting that was nothing but difficult to understand...
[k]

＠Bedivere
There was nothing in particular to do except to spend time just watching the sky and sea.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Bedivere
But...surprisingly, doing so felt peaceful,[sr]or rather, it calmed me.

Sir Tristan uses his Failnaught so skillfully to catch a great many fish.
[k]

？1：Darn, we don't have fishing gear.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Bedivere
Ah, but we do.[sr]I had Miss Da Vinci prepare us some.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

In that much, I planned ahead. I am excited to provide you with the best fishing experience ever.
[k]

？2：Don't we need to have entered that data beforehand?

Do not fret.[sr]I requested Miss Da Vinci's help on that front.

But at times, I find myself thinking this:
[k]

＠Bedivere
Tristan was torn between the two Iseults.[sr]And his fate led him to lose his life by the water.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Or rather, his soul...
[k]

＠Bedivere
Perhaps that is why he cannot be apart from the water. Even now, he could be waiting for that ship with the shining, pale white sail...

[charaFace A 0]
