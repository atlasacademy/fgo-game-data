＠Sakata Kintoki
Bored. I'm so bored I might just nod off to sleep.[sr]Still, not that bad a night.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
City noise isn't bad, but the silence of the wilderness at night is something else altogether.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Specifically, it's like, uh, you know...healing or therapeutic or whatever you call it?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Well, whatever, who cares.[sr]Which do you prefer, Boss?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
A woman of the night, or a woman of the wilderness?[sr]A showy woman, or a reserved and quiet young lady?
[k]

？1：City nights.

[charaFace D 3]
＠Sakata Kintoki
That's surprising. Guess I didn't read you right.

＠Sakata Kintoki
But you know, I also like the cities of your era.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
If we're lucky enough to save the world, I'll take you to a good place. Not quite gold, but platinum.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Sakata Kintoki
It's a favorite I found in a previous materialization. Nice place. Both the booze and the food were pretty good.
[k]

？2：Nights in the wild.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Sakata Kintoki
As expected! I had a feeling you did, buddy![sr]We really do see eye to eye on everything!

＠Sakata Kintoki
But, aren't you a city mouse? Your face says you clearly weren't raised in the mountains.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I grew up in the mountains. You can say the forest was my garden. I used to run around all the time.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Anyway... That sky ring is such a nuisance.

The stupid thing ruins the night scenery.[sr]Really uncool.

I don't like it. Geez, the moon and stars are all you need in a night sky.

That thing's up there, lookin' like the stars, the moon, and even the sun's getting in its way.

I don't know who, but[line 2]

Roaring of an unidentified creature confirmed from the southwest! It's outside of the magical energy detection radius, but...

There's no doubt! It's the roaring of dragonkin!

I wouldn't call them bears! Well, I guess it does no harm to perceive them that way?

Perhaps they chain manifested due to the presence of the dragonkin. Unfortunately for us, there're a lot of them!
