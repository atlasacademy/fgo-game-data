You mustn't, Hundred Personas. Blackbeard may be bad, but he's a pure-hearted dreamer when it comes to his hobbies.
[k]

＠Mash
Even if disavowing his hobby is the right thing to do, it'll only result in his mental collapse!

Apology!? Do you think apologizing will fix my poor, beloved figure!?

This...this girl...an elven-eared craftsman worked her hardest to make this figure by hand. There's no chance of getting another one...

Hah...don't underestimate the Hundred Personas. Our one hundred specializations are not just on the battlefield.

＠Hundred Personas
Dew Painter, as that name suggests, can paint anything in any color and is an expert at befuddling the enemy through coloring.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
He should be an expert in sculpting, if I remember correctly. He did say that magical reconstruction is one of his favorite tasks.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
To further improve this figure to match your greatest desire should be no harder than a snap of the fingers to him.

So, first I want these knee-high socks to be gone to show off her healthy thicc legs, and I'll add glasses, a recorder instrument, and a ribbon...and her clothes will be partially off, and her sides...
