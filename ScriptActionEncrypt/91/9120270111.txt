I'm sure this will also come back to haunt you, Senpai. But there's nothing we can do about it now, is there?

Y-you really think so?

[charaFace B 12]

N-no, you're right. The...methodology may be troubling, but it really just amounts to a medical procedure.

It is just one way to exchange magical energy.[sr]Yes... So there is no problem here...
