Well, wasn't that a nice haul? We got paid three[sr]times what I expected, [%1], Mash!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Yes.[sr]I didn't expect to capture 23 people.

They were tough enough to have a wyvern with them.[sr]Each one's worth a pretty penny, and all together they're worth even more.

That's right. I can pay my tab at that tavern, then[sr]at the others...And then I guess that's all of it.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
You owe money at other taverns too!?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Amadeus
Yes. Most just wouldn't let me in.[sr]Otherwise, why would I go to a new place?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I don't know...Amadeus's skills and appearance are so impressive, but he's got too many personality problems.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Next time we summon him, please summon him at an age where he's more dignified.
[k]

？1：You mean when he's older?

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes. An old Amadeus[sr]should be a lot more calm.
[k]

？2：You mean when he's younger?

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes. He'll be less powerful in battle, but a child of 12 won't be going to pubs.

＠Dr. Roman
No, that's impossible [%1].[sr]A Servant is summoned at the height of their powers.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's at the time of their lives when that Heroic Spirit was strongest. Otherwise there'd be no point.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As long as he's a Servant, Amadeus will carry this form.[sr]Well, his age might change if he's in a different class...

I'm never anything but a Caster.[sr]So you won't see me old, or young.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Amadeus
And I'll tell you something else, Mash.[sr]There are only two kinds of artist Servants.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Two kinds?[sr]Um...What do you mean?
[k]

＠Amadeus
I mean their age when they're summoned.[sr]Whether they appear as children or adults.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Amadeus
I can promise you that artist Servants will all either[sr]be children or young adults. Nothing else.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Amadeus
Servants are summoned at the height of their powers,[sr]right? That means when they were a genius.
[k]

＠Amadeus
The ones who appear as children[sr]grew up to be decent, dignified adults.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Amadeus
That's why they manifest as "children," when they were called geniuses. Child prodigies who didn't care about the problems they caused.

Oh, I see. An artist's talent comes from their instincts.[sr]And they're summoned when those instincts were strongest?

In other words, they're summoned as children, when[sr]they were pure geniuses. And the young adults?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Amadeus
Those ones are weirdos and scums, who would never change until the day they die!

Oh, it's dinner time![sr]My tab's paid off, so it's off to my favorite pub.

[charaFace D 3]
＠Amadeus
Oh, but I do need to thank you.[sr]Here, [%1]. A present from me.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Amadeus
This is also my thanks for everything you do for me.[sr]Buh-bye, then! You guys have a nice dinner too!

He's gone... Some Servants have no interest[sr]in the era they're summoned to,
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
And some Servants, like Amadeus, act like they belong there...
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
There really are all different types of Heroic Spirits...
