Master's room is up ahead. Do you have business there? It is already late, and interrupting one's slumber is bad for their health.

What about you, Berserker? The Mage King's threat is no more. Why are you so on edge?

I am not on edge. I am simply looking for a chance to disinfect your brain.

＠Nightingale
Your mental state is injured.[sr]Your mental state is polluted, abnormal.

＠Nightingale
...It's twisted. Injured. Wounded.

I am the vengeful demon! I am one who ceased to be human ages ago! I am the Count of Monte Cristo!

＠Edmond Dantès
...But I have no need of treatment from you. I am what I am, and I have incarnated as myself in this 21st century.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
As long as Master desires it, the Count of Monte Cristo shall exist. As long as [&he:she] continues to fight, I shall lend my assistance.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
To put it in your terms, the “injury” to my mental state is one that cannot be cured.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
It is precisely the fact that my mind is beyond love and hatred, beyond madness, that certain things become possible for me... It may not happen often, but it does happen.

And do not come near me. Your straightforward ways are similar to [%1]'s.
