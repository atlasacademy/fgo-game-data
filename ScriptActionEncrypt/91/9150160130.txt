Even in a modern time like this one, the instability in the world is enough to allow for the summoning of ancient beasts!

Fool. An attempt to summon a Divine Beast in a London where the foundations of humanity are so unstable is doomed to failure!

Hmph. What a selfish mage. But now that he summoned that thing, we need to deal with it.

It certainly doesn't appear that we'll be able to reason with it and convince it to return whence it came. That being the case, Master...

We shall shine the dazzling brightness of the sun into London's night and incinerate all that is evil.
