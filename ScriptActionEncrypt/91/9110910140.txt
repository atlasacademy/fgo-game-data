I know how you feel, Master.[sr]You're exhausted, body and soul...

I'll admit, I underestimated Lip's pheromones.[sr]Once Medb's group was out of the picture...
[k]

＠BB
...I never thought we'd then run into Gilles (Saber), Anne, Mary, Arjuna, Martha, the lion, the elephant, the sheep...
[k]

...Helena, Semiramis, Abby,[sr]Andersen, Benkei, Caligula...

＠BB
...Phantom, the pitch black puppy boy,[sr]Mecha Eli-chan, and the smart Gil...

[charaFace B 1]
＠BB
And from all these other presences I'm sensing, it doesn't look like we're anywhere near out of the woods yet! That's my Alter Ego for you!
[k]

＠BB
As an event planner myself, I do have to give her props for the way she causes chaos wherever she goes!

I'm doing my best to bite my tongue so nobody picks on me, but they just keep coming by the truckload.

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Passionlip
Yes. That's all my past trauma[sr]coming back to haunt me.
[k]

＠Passionlip
The real me doesn't remember them very well,[sr]so the details might be a little off...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Passionlip
...but that's basically how the other Servants always gang up on me. Isn't it awful!?

[k]

＠Passionlip
All I said is that Medb's good looks aren't helping her get any dates, that d'Eon lacks the decisiveness needed to be a good defender...
[k]

＠Passionlip
...and that Paraíso's too all over the place to leave a real impression! Perfectly harmless, right!?

＠BB
Hmm, I forgot how rough it was seeing an unabashed dark side up close like this. Especially when the girl it belongs to is so clueless.
[k]

＠BB
Even if it is just her second SG ego speaking, there's no way her contracted Master could completely cover for this.
[k]

？1：That's for sure.
？2：That means a lot, coming from the one who cut her off in the first place.

Since we're coming up on the endgame here,[sr]I'm just going to let that one slide.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_1 0.1 1.0]
[charaFace B 0]
＠BB
[%1],[sr]this is Lip's biggest problem.
[k]

＠BB
This lack of self-awareness, along with the “torment me!” vibe she can't help but radiate, only makes her Masochistic Nature even stronger.
[k]

＠BB
But this is who she is. It's not the kind of thing you can fix in a day. Hell, in her case, it's not the kind of thing she can ever fix.
[k]

＠BB
However, the good news is that her Masochistic Nature doesn't need to be fixed, because it's not a negative.
[k]

＠BB
That's where Lip went wrong: thinking of this SG as something that needed to be hidden or corrected.
[k]

＠BB
As her Master, I hope you can[sr]understand and accept that.
[k]

＠BB
If you tell her you don't mind her Masochistic Nature at all, or that you like her just the way she is, it ought to help a lot.

We Alter Egos' Secret Gardens lie beyond[sr]the walls we put up in our hearts.
[k]

＠BB
Once you come to know and accept her secrets,[sr]that's when a Sakura series Alter Ego really shines.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠BB
Though of course, as the Sakura series goes,[sr]Lip and Melt are pretty easy to read.
[k]

＠BB
Lip's skin might be highly sensitive, but she's oblivious when it comes to other people's feelings.
[k]

＠BB
Meltryllis, on the other hand, can barely feel anything on her skin, but she's sharp as a tack about others' feelings.

That...is the last obstacle of this simplified Sakura Labyrinth, as well as its exit!

For our final scene, I called in the strongest Sentinel around to teach Lip a lesson for being so self-centered!

[charaFace B 4]

Say, for the sake of argument, she witnessed her beloved Master getting killed right in her own mind. Don't you think that would shock her into straightening out her act at least a bit?

[charaFace B 0]

Which is why I decided to bring in[sr]a professional to finish the job!

＠BB
There's only so much amateurs like Medb can do to really put the screws to Lip, after all.

＠BB
But, if Lip's exact opposite, Meltryllis,[sr]aka the Alter Ego of pleasure...
[k]

＠BB
...aka the Sadist Prima with the Sadistic Streak SG,[sr]were to carve up Lip's precious Master[line 2]

I don't need any broken-ass AI who can't even determine her own effectiveness worth a damn. So I'll just melt you down, Master and all.

Lip will be off to the scrap heap, and [%1] will finally come to an ignominious end.
