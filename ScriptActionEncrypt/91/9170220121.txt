No. Leave them be.[sr]She is only doing what is in her nature.

Never pursuing dignity or honor... She wouldn't hesitate to turn her back on all that mattered if it meant she would survive.

How ugly...how pitiful...how beautiful that is.

...I remember now. That's why I gave up on her. There was no point forcing her to be my dog. A beast will live and die as a beast. That is all it can do.

She was simply drawn to the scent of my treasures as a wild dog to meat. No more than a stray lurking near the front door.

There's no need to chase such a creature to its lair for the kill. Of course, should she return, I won't hesitate to crush her.
