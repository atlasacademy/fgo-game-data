You idiot![sr]How could an actor refuse to let the curtain go down?

We thrive, and then perish! We cannot avoid death![sr]The ending cannot be changed!

That is why we sing![sr]That is why we scream!

＠Nero
That was wonderful, [%1].[sr]I expected nothing less from you! I knew you were dependable!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Nero
Thanks to you, that which disturbed Rome... No, it[sr]didn't disturb Rome actually, it was being ignored by Rome...
[k]

＠Nero
I feel lonely now.[sr]I think I could get depressed here...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Nero
No, that's not it. The people were just[sr]being nice and pretending they didn't see me!
[k]

＠Nero
That's the Roman citizens and Nero for you![sr]They're the best!
[k]

？1：Just how positive can you be?!
？2：Such a display of strength!

？！

＠Nero
How could I serve as an emperor otherwise?[sr]If you have a little hope, you can laugh.
[k]

＠Nero
That's how I live! No matter how may many[sr]times I fall, I'll get back up again!
[k]

＠Nero
I'll show you that[sr]next time Mash, [%1].
[k]

＠Nero
I was victorious because of you all.[sr]I'll show you my thanks on the battlefield.
[k]

＠Nero
Anyway, let's get back to Chaldea, Master![sr]Let's bring thunderous applause to this Earth!
