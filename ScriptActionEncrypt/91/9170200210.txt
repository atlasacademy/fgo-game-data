...He once said no one should[sr]bother trying to understand him.
[k]

＠
That sometimes, understanding can lead to hatred,[sr]and that hatred can lead to mistakes.
[k]

＠
So one must never try to understand a Berserker.
[k]

＠
For understanding is not in their nature.

Tch...

？1：Are you okay?

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Of course I am.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
I have to keep on winning now.[sr]I don't have any other choice.
[k]

？2：Can you still fight?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...That's a good question, Master.[sr]Stupid one, too.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
'Course I can still fight.[sr]I'm still alive, aren't I?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
That said, I'll admit our situation couldn't suck harder if it tried.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
We can't Rayshift out of here, we can't call Chaldea, I'm the only Servant you've got...
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...and on top of all that, the enemy commands Servants from all the main classes.
[k]

？1：Not to mention we don't even know what time period this is.
？！

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Right.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
There's nothing but primordial forest as far as we can see, the air's filthy, and there's magical energy everywhere.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
This place is at least as bad as the Age of Gods.
[k]

？1：Do you think it's a Demon God Pillar?

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Maybe, but who cares?
[k]

？2：I wonder what's causing this.

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
It might be a Demon God Pillar, but who cares?
[k]

？！

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
What matters is that we're facing seven Servants, and we've gotta beat them all if we wanna get out of here.
[k]


＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Whether we beat them one at a time, or all at once...
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...we won't be fixing this Singularity until you[sr]and I are the only ones left standing here.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
And we need to get this done as fast as possible.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Your body looks to be about at its limit, yeah?
[k]

？1：But...

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
If you're seriously gonna spend any energy worrying about my worthless hide...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...then you have no business trying to save humanity.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]


＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Now that humanity's been restored, there's any number of Masters who could take your place.
[k]

？2：What about you? Are you okay?

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Don't bother worrying about me.[sr]We Servants only exist to fill a need.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]


＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Your hesitation could easily get us both killed.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Don't get close to me, don't defend me, don't even treat me like a person. ...It'll just dull my spear.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
All right, no more chitchat.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
All there is now is to fight[sr]until I get you back home.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Ready?
[k]

Too bad it won't do you any good, seeing as you're stuck with a Berserker.
