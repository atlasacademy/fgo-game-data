＠
...Britain has met its end.
[k]

＠
A most horrific of ends. Everyone and everything dead. But by happenstance, I was spared.
[k]

＠
All was sacrificed.
[k]

＠
The King of Knights, Gawain, Mordred, Kay... Merlin escaped to paradise...or was he driven there?
[k]

＠
The Round Table collapsed. Camelot is a land of ruin. Yet I survive...somehow.
[k]

＠
After my death, I ascended to the Throne of Heroes, gaining a second life as a Servant.
[k]

＠
And yet I feel as if I am still struggling to live in my homeland...

＠Shakespeare
This is merely an analogy...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Shakespeare
Let us make a play about the end of Britain.[sr]Oh, please do not be vexed.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Shakespeare
As a playwright, this is the[sr]only way I can express myself.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Lord Mordred plays the role of demise.[sr]The knight of rebellion is truly the epitome of the end.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
That knight gathered all rebels to her banner, splitting Britain in twain, and laid waste to the Round Table itself...
[k]

＠Shakespeare
...Bringing our play to its conclusion.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Shakespeare
King Arthur shall play the role of the sacrifice.[sr]And so I beg your indulgence.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Shakespeare
The king was, to be sure, used as a sacrifice.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
The one at the center of Britain's tragedy, but retaining her composure as the King of Knights through it all... There won't be a dry eye in the house.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
I suppose it may have ended differently,[sr]but I confess that I would not know.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Now, for you, Sir Lancelot.[sr]Your parts in this play will be mixed.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Your character witnesses the Round Table's split, and you will also take on the task of informing the audience of the play's conclusion.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
You, the sole witness, watch in agony[sr]as the tragedy unfolds before your eyes.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
You walked the path of the knight, and were charged with passing on the idea that knighthood itself had not perished.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Shakespeare
Whether you succeeded in doing so... Well, I imagine that is a question you can answer better than I.

I see. That's quite the merciless view of things.[sr]Such could only come from the mind of a playwright.

...In that case, I am a man past his time, yes?

When one calls upon a knight, it should be for battle, or to save a princess.

As I see no princess, it seems battle is to be the order of the day!
