I'll ask you the same question: what are you doing in Master's room? It is the middle of the night.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Sleep is necessary to maintain the health of a human body. I advise you to return to your own room to rest, Mister Edmond Dantès.

I'm speaking of Master. Our conversation will interrupt [&his:her] sleep cycle. Though [&he:she] may be sleeping peacefully right now...

[charaFace A 1]

＠Edmond Dantès
Peacefully, is that right?

If you must.

＠Nightingale
It's been bothering me for a while, but it seems an emergency operation will be necessary.
[k]

＠Nightingale
I must take action before it is too late. Leave it to me. I shall pursue the most effective treatment for the injured area.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Edmond Dantès
...Master is not injured.[sr]As you pointed out, I hear peaceful breathing.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]
＠Nightingale
No. Wrong, Sir.

＠Edmond Dantès

＠Nightingale
I am talking about you. Your mental state is injured.[sr]If it's the surgical removal of the affected area you require, leave it to me.

Mercédès. I know of your wicked ways, but to go that far seems excessive, even to you?

Just like that. That statement. You may not realize it, but your outbursts suggest that you're mistaking me for someone else.

Swift, decisive action must be taken. Yes. You have uttered troubling nonsense about the sleeping Master.

Don't you dare come at me with a scalpel in one hand and a gun in the other. At least hold the scalpel in your dominant hand. No, that's not what I meant to say!
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Why are you watching Master sleep, anyway?[sr]You must have sensed some sort of abnormality.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Edmond Dantès
I don't know if it's instinct, or if you sensed something in [&his:her] magical energy, but you are correct. You've read the situation right.

＠Edmond Dantès
Master is in contact with many Servants, so how did this happen to [&his:her] mental state?

It appears that you do not see me as a Servant.[sr]You call me Berserker, yet still call me Mercédès.

However, as I am still not this Mercédès, there is nothing for it but to take the appropriate measures. Thus...
