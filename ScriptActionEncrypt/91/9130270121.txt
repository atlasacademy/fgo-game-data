Medusa!?[sr]Oh no... She's collapsed from her wounds...!
[k]

？1：Let's carry her to the infirmary.
？2：Let's treat her right away.

＠Mash
But we lack the first aid here...
[k]

＠Mash
The best thing to do is to transport her to an appropriate place for treatment, Senpai. Let's go.

＠Stheno
No need. This is the result of our foolish younger sister's carelessness. It's something her family should take care of.
[k]

＠Euryale
Indeed. Making her two older sisters go through so much trouble...she really is a dumb, clumsy, and good-for-nothing younger sister.
[k]

＠Euryale
If Mash takes her, she won't know how much trouble she caused for us when she finally wakes up, now will she?
[k]

＠Euryale
For her to owe us...to remind her that she will always be beneath her older sisters, I will carry her. I don't want to, but I will.

...Senpai. There are times when watching Stheno and Euryale's banter worries me...
[k]

＠Mash
But I feel that a lot of the reason they behave that way is because of the absolute, unwavering confidence in their bonds with each other.
[k]

？1：They're family.
？2：They have a bond.

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Yes. Even if one of them looks different than before, the fact that they are family will never change.
[k]

＠Mash
No matter what, they are a trio of sisters who get along very well!
