Perfect, then! Even the defeat of a small foe would be a worthy addition to my legend!

＠Vlad III
My name remains infamous, but I shall not be known as demonic nor as vampiric.

＠Vlad III
Very well. Let's go, Master!

？1：Let's do our best!

Yes, but that doesn't mean it is not malicious.[sr]The Demonic Fog still seems to be lingering in the city.

＠Mash
It may normally be “just a wraith,” but right now it's a deadly evil spirit.
