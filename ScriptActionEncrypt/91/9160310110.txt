I, on the other hand, acquired my inhumanity later on, so my sense of time is so finely attuned I was able to match my breathing to Master's down to the second. I'm keeping count, so there's no mistake!

？1：...(World's longest awkward pause) Right!

[charaFace F 5]

＠Kiyohime
Hmm. I'll have to get to the bottom[sr]of what that long silence meant later.
[k]

？2：Are you now. Gee, what a coincidence.

[charaFace F 4]

＠Kiyohime
(Sniff) You can be so cold sometimes, Master...[sr]But I won't let that bring me down!

That's just what we came here to ask.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
As if turning your room into a separate world wasn't bad enough, now you want to shut yourself in it for fifty years!?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
From one hime to another, I refuse[sr]to let you get away with this!

Ugh. I'm sorry you had to see my friend behave so disgracefully, Master...

Still, she was at least being[sr]truthful in what she said.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
She truly is frightened, and does[sr]really want to shut herself away.
[k]


＠Kiyohime
But she's also determined to put up a fight to make that happen now. She never had that kind of confidence before.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
To put it simply, Master...
[k]

＠Kiyohime
...she's just as proud to be your Servant as any of us.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Yes, that pride may have led her to be weirdly confident about all the wrong things, but that's just Batty for you.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Kiyohime
All right, Master, let's make our way straight to the castle keep, shall we?
