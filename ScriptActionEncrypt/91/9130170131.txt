Hot-blooded...not a problem! To be called a divine spear and keep cool... I am not there yet!

But it's still not enough! Not enough![sr]A true violent spear is one that would crush a swift fist!

If not, I would be embarrassed to even use my second name of “Divine Spear”!

With that flimsy spear against my fists, you managed to dodge, parry, and attack...
[k]

＠Yan Qing
Just when I thought your attacks were almost too direct, you start throwing in whimsical twists... Let me guess: you've got a bad personality, right?

Indeed. Training. Although, it would have been a fight to the death if we had kept going. There are so many things that I still lack.

＠Li Shuwen
I will polish my spear skills by fighting in the coming battles.

Skillful Star, Yan Qing,[sr]I'd like a rematch one of these days.

No, not at a drinking hole. Shall we go out to play a round of Go in the bamboo forest?

I just don't like to drink...and not only alcohol.[sr]Tea especially.

Sheesh. Guess I have no choice![sr]I'll go along with what you want today.
[k]

＠Yan Qing
But in exchange, next time you're gonna have to do what I want! We're gonna drink, eat, sing, and dance!

Hm. In that, I too will have no choice.[sr]Well, pardon me on the singing and dancing part, okay?

That's good, Senpai. Since they're both martial artists, I'm sure they have lots in common.

Once their game of Go is done,[sr]let's all Rayshift home.
