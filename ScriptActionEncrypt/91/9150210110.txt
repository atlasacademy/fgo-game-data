Pure water and unpolluted air...[sr]This is a calm forest, isn't it?
[k]

＠Fou
Fou, Foou♪
[k]

＠Mash
Do you feel that way, too, Fou? Even with the[sr]buzzing tree leaves and the chirping sound of birds,
[k]

＠Mash
for some reason, I think of only serenity.[sr]Is it because there're no humans here?
[k]

？1：It's pretty relaxing, huh?

？2：This is nice, isn't it?

？！

＠Cú Chulainn
Forests are nice. Well, that's because animals[sr]and plants are singing the praises of life here.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Despite the bustle of people and other things, forests can stand up as forests solely by themselves.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
It's not the domain of people, in the first place. Though[sr]almost the entire earth is dominated by humans now.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Animals, plants, fairies, gods. Compared to[sr]those in the forest, humans are just "extras."

So, an uninvited guest.[sr]Is that who we are[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
Umm?[sr]No, it's not that stiff...

...But how awful. The forest around here feels off.[sr]I came here to take a look and the air is just too rough.

＠Dr. Roman
I didn't pick up anything here...[sr]Is there really a distortion here, Cú Chulainn?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Second Singularity, the 1st Century you guys fixed[sr][line 2]This is northeastern Ireland in that time period.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Sure, from the measurement there seems to be a[sr]delay in this era's correction. But is it a distortion?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Looking at the numbers, it just seems to be a quiet forest...

I don't know about your situation but[sr]you shouldn't take forests lightly.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Forests have been around since before mankind.[sr]They may even have been around from the Age of the Gods even before that.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Manipulating humans is exactly what it does best.[sr]Just look at that.
