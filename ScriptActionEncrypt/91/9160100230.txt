Huhuhu. The star always arrives late, right? To clean[sr]up a little sister's mishap is an older sister's duty.

Huhuhu. Did you honestly believe those words?[sr]You really have to train much more, Medusa.

Always doubt things that sound too good to be true, yes? Me, do something that would delight you? Such a thing[line 3]
