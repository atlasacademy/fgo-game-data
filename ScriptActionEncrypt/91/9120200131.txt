＠Gilgamesh
Heh. Fool. Nothing could ever make me hand over my treasury to you.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I transferred it well out of your reach a long time ago. This is just an extra bank deposit vault.

No way!? How could a third deposit vault still reek so much of treasure!?

Just how high is your Golden Rule ranked!?

＠Gilgamesh
Hmph. It does make one wonder what too much wealth is. But in my case, I do not spend my fortune. I simply accumulate more riches.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I am a true collector. My infinite collection of treasure exists, as I cannot be the true wielder of each and every one of them.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
But you can be neither collector nor wielder,[sr]you useless goddess!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
You do not love your treasures, nor will they love you back in turn! You're the sort who comes and goes with all the constancy of a shooting star!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Gilgamesh
So forget about weighing yourself down with more wealth than you can carry. Do not burden yourself with earthly treasures. Flying about in the heavens suits you far better anyway.

King Gilgamesh disappeared...[sr]We were able to see him again, but he left so quickly...

？！

＠Ishtar
...Hmph. It's okay.[sr]I don't care. Not one bit.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I won in battle, and he won't bother us again.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Ishtar
But thanks for worrying about me.[sr]That cheered me up a bit.

But we're faced with another problem now.[sr]If this isn't the Treasury of Babylon...
[k]

＠Ishtar
...then all my research was for nothing. My plan (read: race) I came up with to get the treasure will need to be reexamined...
[k]

？1：You may not have money, but you're a winner, Ishtar.
？2：A flat-broke goddess is still beautiful.

？！


[charaFace A 5]

＠Ishtar
Is that supposed to be encouraging!?[sr]Or are you mocking me!? Which is it!?

I believe those are Senpai's true feelings.
[k]

＠Mash
And what King Gilgamesh said before he left didn't sound like mockery to me, either.
[k]

＠Mash
Don't you think that was his own way of acknowledging who you are?

Hmph. Who knows? Being correct and being right aren't always the same thing.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Even if he did praise me, I'd much rather have found out where the treasury is!
[k]

？1：This was a lot of trouble for nothing.

？！

[charaFace A 12]

＠Ishtar
Ungh! That's the last thing I wanted to hear! Dummy! You'd better hold your tongue, [%1]!
[k]

＠Ishtar
Listen! I'm never going to give up! I'm gonna redeem myself for my blunder at the Demonic Front!
