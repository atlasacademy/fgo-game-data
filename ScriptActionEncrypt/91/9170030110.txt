Make yourself comfortable, Senpai.[sr]Here's your coffee.

No, it's nothing... Oh, the Doctor has[sr]something he wants to talk to you about.
[k]

？2：Why don't you rest for a bit.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Well...about that... There's something[sr]the Doctor wants to talk to you about, Senpai.

It's him! Him!! Berserker! Don't you think[sr]it's a bit odd having a Berserker for a guard?
[k]

？1：Really? You think so?

？2：What? I can't?

？！

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Well, think about it...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A Berserker is a Servant that has lost its reason, so in a way, they can be said to be the most loyal.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
However, this Berserker is different.[sr]Even you have heard of his tales, right?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He is known by numerous titles, such as "Unrivaled," "Flying General" and "Lu Bu the Peerless,"
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
but he betrayed so many people[sr]and became so detested, that people called him...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
"Tiger and Wolf"[sr]...just so you know.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
What I'm trying to say is, it's not good to have him as[sr]your guard. It's dangerous, [%1]...
