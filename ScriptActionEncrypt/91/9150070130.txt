[charaFace D 2]
＠Shakespeare
And now it's time for the climax!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Uh, are you sure you didn't summon them?[sr]With the power a Caster might use, maybe?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Shakespeare
Sorry, but I'm not skilled in magecraft at all.[sr]I'm a writer, after all.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Right.[sr]You do have a point there[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Shakespeare
Anyway, there's a villain who's feeling frustrated.[sr]Let's say, his initial is 'S.'
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
S?[sr]Um, Mr. Shakespeare? So it is you[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Shakespeare
The villain named S grows impatient with the town's neverending peace, curses the people, and to top it all off, he comes up with a plot!
[k]

＠Shakespeare
It was to use the townspeople![sr]To incite the townspeople, and turn them into daemons so he can make them attack our heroes.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
What!?[sr]Shakespeare, is that[line 2]!?

＠Mash
No way...!?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Shakespeare
They have no people to protect, no friends to share laughter with.[r]All they do now is shiver with loneliness[line 2]
[k]

＠Shakespeare
"You can give in." The demon whispers.[sr]"You can rest now." The nightmare murmurs.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Shakespeare
Well, well, well, what are you going to do, Mash Kyrielight? Indeed, what are you going to do, [%1][line 2]My Master!?
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
Ugh...[sr]Master!
[k]

？1：We are such stuff as dreams are made on.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Shakespeare
Ha![sr]I didn't expect that answer!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Shakespeare
It essentially means transience, that everything you struggle for in life is merely what happens in your dream.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Shakespeare
But, however[line 2]you are different.[sr]You've perceived a different meaning in it.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Shakespeare
A dream is hope.[sr]Hope is what is laid with courage and determination.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Shakespeare
Then, your battle speaks for itself.[sr]For you are the dream!
[k]

？2：I don't care about philosophy.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Shakespeare
Heheheh, I knew you'd say that![sr]What you just said is absolutely true, Master!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Shakespeare
A demon's whisper, reasonable conclusion, and compelling valid argument.[r]All those kinds of things[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Shakespeare
You're welcome to get over them simply by saying, "I don't care!"
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Because it is evil in the name of a valid argument.[sr]It is a cowardly trick trying to camouflage the evil with a facade called theory.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Just go ahead and do it!
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Shakespeare
You are great, Master.[sr]You are fantastic and invincible!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...Yes.[sr]He's absolutely right, Master.
[k]

＠Mash
I have no doubts. If there's no way to turn them back, we just need to defeat them.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
I'm coming with you, Master!
