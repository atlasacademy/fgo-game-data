Once, in another world...
[k]

＠
...there was a Holy Grail War.
[k]

＠
A magecraft ritual in which seven Masters and seven Servants fought to grant their hearts' desires.
[k]

＠
I, Diarmuid, was among those summoned by the Grail, manifesting as the indomitable Saber class rather than my usual Lancer self.
[k]

＠
That was when I met her.
[k]

＠
A drifter wandering across time and space,[sr]through countless different worlds.

Aha. Now I finally get it.
[k]

＠Musashi
So that's what's happening here![sr]This is a...erm, Holy Grail War, right?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Musashi
That explains why there's so many Servants here,[sr]and why it all went so ugly so fast.

I was kind of shocked when they all started attacking me one after the other.

＠Musashi
...But now I guess it makes sense.
[k]

＠Musashi
Since they're all hoping to make their wishes come true, and only one of them can succeed...
[k]

＠Musashi
...it's no wonder they'd be so aggressive.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Musashi
So thanks, and sorry! This was really informative,[sr]but I'm afraid I can't take part in this deathmatch.
[k]

＠Musashi
I'm really more of a drifter.
[k]

＠Musashi
I'm not one of the Heroic Spirits the Holy Grail chose to take part in this war.

...I see. So your manifestation[sr]does not depend on the Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
Though I would usually find that difficult to believe, I will take you at your word, Miyamoto Musashi of the two swords.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
So, you seek mastery over the heavens themselves.[sr]I never thought to witness swordplay like yours.

I'm glad I got to meet you too,[sr]Diarmuid Ua Duibhne of the Knights of Fianna.
[k]

＠Musashi
Seeing as you're the only Heroic Spirit here who was actually willing to listen to me!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Musashi
I wish I could stay and talk more...
[k]

＠Musashi
...but it looks like sticking around any longer[sr]is gonna mess with this Holy Grail War business.
[k]

＠Musashi
So I'll just leave it at this!

She told me Chaldea was an organization tasked with preserving humanity, and one of the few places where all sorts of Heroic Spirits could coexist peacefully.
[k]

＠
Strangely enough...I never forgot what she said.
[k]

＠
Even when I began to disappear once that Holy Grail War concluded, I thought about Chaldea.
[k]

＠
Then, I was gone...
[k]

＠
...or so I thought.

...I suppose there is no better[sr]word for this than “fate.”
[k]

＠Diarmuid
Perhaps the Holy Grail ended up granting my wish after all, but for whatever reason...a part of my soul accomplished something miraculous.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
I crossed between worlds, just like the[sr]one seeking mastery over the heavens.

Granted, I was only able to do so as a bug in the simulator, but I managed it nonetheless.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Diarmuid
However, at the same time, I inadvertently ended up drawing the remnants of the Fairy King Ábartach's soul towards me, thanks to our deep connection.

For that, I am truly sorry.
