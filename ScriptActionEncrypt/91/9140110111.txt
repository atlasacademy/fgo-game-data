Doctor, Senpai, what are you doing?
[k]

＠Mash
First you ordered a panting Boudica to[sr]"Look down, embarrassed," during battle...
[k]

＠Mash
...and then you started saying this weird stuff...[sr]Why? What's the meaning of this?

Hahaha, I had fun![sr]Anyway[line 2]

＠Boudica
Thanks for coming with me, guys. We wiped out[sr]those bad goblins from my home's forests.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Boudica
When you fixed Nero's era, I got a bad feeling.
[k]

＠Boudica
So I came here to check it out, and sure enough, I was right.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I believed in you.[sr]I knew your intuition was correct.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Boudica
Thanks, Mash. You really are a good girl.[sr]I'll give you something nice later.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
N-Not really...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Boudica
But I've never seen goblins swell up like that.[sr]There were so many, and they attacked us.
[k]

＠Boudica
Forest spirits aren't necessary always like that, you know.
[k]

＠Boudica
It should be rare to see them at all.[sr]Hmm...
[k]

＠Boudica
Maybe this is the Grail's doing?[sr]What a mess that thing makes.

＠Mash
Is it that easy...[sr]for human wishes to cause disaster?
[k]

＠Mash
The Grail can grant any wish, so it can easily[sr]cause disasters. Which means that maybe...
[k]

＠Mash
Human wishes themselves often bring disaster.[sr]That's just a theory though[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Boudica
Yes.[sr]You might be right.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Boudica
But I don't think I want to believe that.
[k]

＠Boudica
Wishes are supposed to be...[sr]They're supposed to be much simpler things.
[k]

＠Boudica
More humble, and warmer, I think.
[k]

＠Boudica
For example...

Like eating a nice meal with someone you love, maybe.
[k]

＠Boudica
That's what I mean.[sr]Do you understand[line 2]what I'm saying?
[k]

？1：Yup! Lunchtime!

？2：Let's get back to that break!

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Boudica
Hahaha, that's right! Now, sit down.[sr]I'll get the lunches out!
