Don't worry, “Eve.”[sr]I never expected anything of you to begin with.

[charaFace E 0]
＠E. Fran
[line 2]Huh?
[k]

＠Victor
After all, the defect is in the soul used as the base.
[k]

＠Victor
It's probably because you're not created from magical circuits like the homunculi.
[k]

＠Victor
A degraded soul is inferior to a human.[sr]It can't possibly defeat a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Victor
There's only one reason I created you.

I know.[sr]But[line 2]in the end, you're defective.

And so am I, as a human.[sr]So I'm taking your body.
[k]

＠Victor
My soul. My knowledge. My mind.[sr]Your body. Your abilities.

＠Victor
Only together can we attain “Eve.” The gender change will be a bit difficult[line 2]but it's nothing to worry about.

No...I don't want that...why...no...no...no...[sr]I don't...want...to become...Father!
