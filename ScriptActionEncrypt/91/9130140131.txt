You have wasted so much power; power that already exceeded your limits. Of course it would leave you vulnerable.

You completely failed to understand your own body, Purgatorio.

Hmm, I suppose you may fare a bit better against an opponent with swords since that has been your focus...

...but the rest is quite sloppy. You may have gained in one area, but you have lost much in others.

Whether they reach the level of the Buddha or become an oni, everyone eventually hits their limit.

Speaking for myself, I find it an incredible waste.

Your spear may have grown sharper,[sr]but as a Lancer, you have grown weaker.

Phew, there we go.[sr]Now that was a good simulation.

＠Inshun
Lady Mash, would you be so kind as to turn the simulator off now? ...Lady Mash?
[k]

？1：I don't think we're in the simulator.


＠Inshun
...Are you sure?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Inshun
They called me here so suddenly that I simply assumed this was some sort of emergency training...
[k]

？2：I think this is just a dream.

＠Inshun
I see. Just another dream sequence, huh.[sr]...Wait. A dream!?[charaFace A 2]
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Inshun
Ahh...
[k]

＠Inshun
I never thought this would only turn out[sr]to be a dream I shared with you, Master!

[charaFace A 3]
＠Inshun
Hmm... Well, I suppose that is all right.
[k]

＠Inshun
If the only life I took was my own,[sr]surely no one could be upset about that!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Inshun
Indeed, I believe they refer[sr]to this as a win-win-win!
[k]

＠Inshun
...No?
[k]

？1：All's well that ends well!
？！

＠Inshun
Right!

[charaFace A 4]
＠Inshun
Now then, I think I will have to try dueling Lady Musashi as soon as I wake up...
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Inshun
Otherwise, all the effort Purgatorio put into[sr]his anti-Musashi techniques will go to waste.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Inshun
Still, there is one thing this[sr]incident has assured me of, Master.
[k]

＠Inshun
I am now certain that I truly[sr]am the best version of myself!
