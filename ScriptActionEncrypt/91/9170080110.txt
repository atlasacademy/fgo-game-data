The Doctor says that when you were summoned, there was a disturbance during this era in this spot.
[k]

＠Mash
That might be the reason why you can't unlock your second Noble Phantasm.

Something else was summoned at the same time...[sr]The answer's simple.

So[line 2]you think it's Grendel?

No doubt. I can't think of anything besides him[sr]that could influence the summoning process.

It's true there are nameless fire dragons out there...

＠Beowulf
But Grendel was the only monster with such fierce hate and glory in my life.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Beowulf
He was an evil creature who played with people's lives.
[k]

＠Beowulf
The kind of evil that reveled in the meaningless slaughter[sr]of people trapped in their dwellings.
[k]

＠Beowulf
I can understand fights over territory,[sr]or animals just fighting for survival.
[k]

＠Beowulf
But[line 2]Grendel had both reason and intellect[sr]and was simply evil.
[k]

＠Beowulf
That's why his very existence...[sr]is far more of a threat to me than that of a fire dragon.
[k]

＠Beowulf
Fire dragons are passive as long as you leave their treasure alone. But Grendel's a twisted monster who revels in evil.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Beowulf
If he revived as a side-effect of my summoning[line 2][sr]I gotta kill him.

If you take a look at it, maybe you'll figure something out.

Okay.[sr]Let's go, Master.

There are some things that shouldn't exist in this world.[sr]Grendel is one of them.

The more human flesh he consumes, the more powerful and evil he gets. We have to crush him before he attains his perfect form.
