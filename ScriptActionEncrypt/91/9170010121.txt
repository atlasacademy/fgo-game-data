Oh, [%1], I figured out why Berserker did what he did earlier.

＠Mash
...Earlier?[sr]Oh, you mean when that girl was spared by Heracles.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Yes, that. I thought there was something odd about it, so I did some digging and found out the Madness Enhancement on Heracles,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
is actually rather weak.[sr]It leaves a tiny bit of his reasoning intact.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
So, earlier, thanks to that bit of reasoning, he didn't attack the girl.

＠Mash
Oh, I see. But why is Heracles's[sr]Madness Enhancement so weak?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Well, that's because Madness Enhancement was originally a skill meant to forcefully strengthen weak Servants.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But when it comes to a Servant like Heracles, driving him mad consumes massive amounts of magical energy.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In other words, the Madness Enhancement level is reduced, enabling him to manifest by using less energy.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Anyway, the fact that you don't have that much magical energy, [%1], also plays a role in that.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
You mean to say, Heracles's current status[sr]is much weaker than what he could've been?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
But even at that, it's far stronger than most Heroic Spirits.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Rather, I am kind of scared to[sr]find out what he could've been.
[k]

？1：Well, I see...

？2：So, he'd be even stronger than now.

...But I'm sure that even at Heracles's original state of madness, that girl still would have been safe.

＠Dr. Roman
No, no. I really doubt that.[sr]He's a Berserker, you know. A Berserker!
[k]

？1：You're right. I'm sure of it too.

？2：Heracles wouldn't do that.

？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
I'm not so sure about that...

[charaFace A 1]

Yes, for sure...!
