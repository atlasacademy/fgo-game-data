It's insensitive AND immoral, right?[sr]That's what the far side of the moon is all about♡

＠BB
Hmm, looks like we've still got a little[sr]ways to go until the first real obstacle.
[k]

＠BB
Why don't we take advantage of this time to go[sr]over the finer points of what an Alter Ego is?
[k]

[charaFace B 6]
＠BB
First off, when I say Alter Ego, I'm talking about the Servants that were born from me...
[k]

＠BB
The Sakura series, like Meltryllis and Passionlip.

＠BB
See, the original BB[line 2]the one I was copied from[line 2]went a little buggy once.
[k]

＠BB
Even though she was an AI,[sr]she tried to emulate humans.
[k]

＠BB
She attempted to remake the world to suit her own purposes, just like they do.
[k]

＠BB
And to do that, she modified herself over and over...
[k]

＠BB
...on the far side of the moon,[sr]where there's no concept of time.
[k]

＠BB
One day, she tried leveling up again and again in Void Space before a certain Master finished their fifth battle.
[k]

＠BB
Usually, that kind of growth should have been impossible. She was never designed to be expanded that way.
[k]

＠BB
Imagine trying to slap a combustion engine on a manual scooter and you'll have some idea of what that was like.
[k]

＠BB
But even though she wasn't designed for it,[sr]BB kept adding engines to her tiny frame.
[k]

＠BB
...She started with an engine for the same size scooter as her, then moved on to one for a motorcycle.
[k]

＠BB
Next, she added a car engine. Then one for a pickup truck... A dump truck... A private jet... A battle cruiser...
[k]


＠BB
It was like looking at the engineering equivalent of a dumpster fire. Or maybe like cancer cells spreading throughout a host.
[k]

＠BB
But it still wasn't nearly[sr]enough to achieve her goal.
[k]

＠BB
She kept modifying herself more and more radically.
[k]

＠BB
A jet engine. An oil tanker. A power plant. A nuclear reactor. All sorts of engines her little frame was never built to support.
[k]

＠BB
She piled on one ill-fitting addition after another, and ended up turning into a Giga Structure.
[k]

＠BB
By that point, her insides were a hot mess. Her human thought processes were bound to get all screwed up!
[k]

＠BB
And that is what led to the birth of the Sakura Five.
[k]

＠BB
Somewhere along the way, BB got the idea to separate her expanding egos and functionalities from herself, and make them into her assistants.
[k]

＠BB
When all was said and done, five Alter Egos had been born. Five AIs created from BB's own emotions.
[k]

＠BB
Emotions she cut off from herself because she decided they were unnecessary... Well, not quite. She feared them because she couldn't control them any longer.
[k]

＠BB
Meltryllis, the Alter Ego of pleasure.[sr]Passionlip, the Alter Ego of love and hatred.
[k]

＠BB
Violet, the Alter Ego of purity.[sr]Kingprotea, the Alter Ego of desire.
[k]

＠BB
And Kazuradrop, the Alter Ego of affection.
[k]

＠BB
Every Ego was born from BB's emotions,[sr]but Lip was one of the most dangerous.
[k]

＠BB
She refused to face her flaws, demanded unconditional love, and hated anyone who wouldn't give it to her.
[k]

＠BB
Like they say, it's a thin line between love and hate. As an Ego, Lip blindly loved and loathed whomever she set her sights on.

Still, after a bunch of shit went down, she learned there's no such thing as unconditional love, and she's been working on accepting that!
[k]

？1：No such thing as unconditional love, huh...
？2：Lip's a hard worker.

？！

＠BB
True. It just goes to show that if you want to be loved, it doesn't matter how cute you are.
[k]

＠BB
You still need the courage to put yourself out there, the sincerity to work on your flaws, and consideration for others!
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

Of course, I've already got that sort of thing down pat. I'm always thinking up new ways to trip up humanity!
