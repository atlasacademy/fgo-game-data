What an impoverished bunch of giants...[sr]I had hoped they carried better treasure than this...

Heroic Spirits who hunt dragons have it nice.[sr]Dragons are super rich and hoard a bunch of treasure!

Hey! Don't call me an old man! That's rude![sr]Call me big brother...or even gramps!

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah, yeah, got it, big brother![sr]If that's what you want, then quit acting like an old man!

Ah, got it! I pride myself in looking young no matter how old I am.

＠David
...But you're right. There's a ton of them. It's like a giant army of...giants. Could this be a reenactment of some myth?

＠Dr. Roman
Honestly, this feels a little staged.[sr]King David, does that ring a bell for you?

You know the saying “there's a Jack for every Jill.”[sr]Hm, that doesn't sound right. Um, “tit for tat”?
[k]

＠David
To cut to the chase, they're all priced as fit.[sr]After all, I'm the “giant killer.”
[k]

＠David
And that means the world would pretty much assemble a bunch of giant beings to greet me.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠David
Those beings have come to defeat me,[sr]even as I'm here to beat the crap out of them!
[k]

？1：So you're a lure for giants!
？2：The giants really love and are drawn to you!

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠David
I know. It's really not a great connection to have, though.
[k]

＠David
Like girls that are taller than me...[sr]Honestly, they're not my type...

Ah. I suppose we don't have time to talk about my tastes. You know, I'm not really liking this arbitrary ambush either...

＠David
They may be giants, but if they still have some intellect, I'm going to give them a talking-to. Hey you, you have the right to reform yourself.

I see. Then you leave me with no choice![sr]In service of a just cause, even the meek can slay a giant!

Allow me to demonstrate with this small rock!
