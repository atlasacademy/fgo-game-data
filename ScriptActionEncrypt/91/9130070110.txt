[line 2]Hi.

＠Cú Chulainn
Rise and shine.[sr]Say, how was your sleep?
[k]

？1：Where are we?

？2：Wait, where's Mash?

？！

＠Cú Chulainn
Let's see, this is a place in the middle of nowhere.[sr]Oh, the Missy isn't here.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
Just you and me.[sr]My bad, for forcing you into this.

＠Cú Chulainn
The Doctor's voice doesn't reach here.[sr]That little creature isn't here, either.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Why?[sr]Well, that's simple.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
This is[line 2]
[k]

？1：In a dream?

？2：In my consciousness?

？！

＠Cú Chulainn
You can call it a dream, or perhaps somewhere[sr]deeper than consciousness and unconsciousness?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
I'm not clear on the details, it occasionally happens to Servants and Masters.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
A shared dream.[sr]Put it simply, we can see each other's memories[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
That's why we can both exist here like this, even though it's "my dream."
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
That's right. This is my dream.[sr]My memories. My battlefield.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
It looks like the one you saw before?[sr]Yeah, I suppose it does from your point of view.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
It's linked to the most similar sight[sr]you've seen recently, I think.

Look, here they come.[sr]To me, they look like the armies of Connacht[line 2]
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
But who knows what they look like to you.[sr]Hey, snap out of it, it's gonna be a fight.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Cú Chulainn
Try to keep up with your commands![sr]If you can summon other Heroic Spirits, then do it!
