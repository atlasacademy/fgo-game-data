The leopard-tiger-jaguar-panther lady would go on to become a surprisingly popular Servant later.
[k]

＠Heroine XX
That was the midseason episode that was absurdly popular among children.
[k]

＠Heroine XX
It led to all sorts of spin-off series that took place on the mysterious planet of Guntama.

I couldn't remember much about my[sr]past before I came to the academy.

It wasn't until I came to Guntama that I learned these glasses were the secret key to restoring my memories.

It also lead directly into “The Final Battle![sr]Destroy the Bridge on Twin Planet Esaba”...

...the climactic episode of our first season.

Do sweet beans go well with buns?
[k]

＠X Alter
Right around the time that episode aired, X and I were known as agents capable of single-handedly destroying entire planets in the course of our missions.
[k]

＠X Alter
So when the two of us worked together, we could limit the collateral damage to a single planet.

...Uh, a-ahem. In the future, try not to go around casually destroying planets.

Oh yes. It was a huge ordeal.[sr]That's why it wasn't just X and me there.
[k]

＠X Alter
There were also other students from the academy, and even some teachers who were also active hero Servants.
[k]

＠X Alter
By that point, it was no longer just a school assignment, but an important military operation.

...Esaba is an artificial planet that is in reality two planets connected by an interstellar bridge.
[k]

＠X Alter
It's home to an enormous factory that was targeted and occupied by the League of Villains.
[k]

＠X Alter
The villains repurposed the factory's incredible technology to create a huge army of military robots.
[k]

＠X Alter
While the individual units were no match for a Servant, the danger they posed came from their sheer, overwhelming numbers.
[k]

＠X Alter
Our mission was to recover the manufacturing[sr]base in order to break the deadlock.
