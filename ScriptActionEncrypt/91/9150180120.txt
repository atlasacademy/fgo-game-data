It appears you've put too much energy into concealing your identity and made yourself weak in battle.

Or have you underestimated me because I'm a Caster? Fool. I may be a mage, but never forget that I am the King of Heroes!

Sorry. I just realized that a handful of Servant readings have disappeared from Chaldea, too.

It took us some time to confirm since we're missing some of our staff...I usually make it a habit to check on the Spirit Origin graphs...

I ran a quick check, and Jack is indeed missing.

The Spirit Origin pattern still shows it's in an excited state, which means she is still summoned...

Let us simply say that I wished for everyone to have an opportunity to rest.

Everyone is under orders to rest in shifts, but I wonder, can one really call it “rest” when it is made mandatory?

To be free of their distress and rest their minds...[sr]I believed that to be in their best interests.

We found little medicinal satchels that read “Safe, Cutting-edge, Forward-thinking Von Hohenheim Brand” under each of their pillows...

＠Paracelsus
The staff members were all exhausted, so I simply gave them special medicine, is all I can say...
[k]

＠Paracelsus
Please rest assured. Leaving aside the question of ingredients, the medicine is both potent and effective. Until they have had adequate rest, nothing can wake them.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
...Well, as to how exhausted they were...that is beyond my knowledge.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
So if, for example, they were exhausted from three days of constant work, they will remain asleep for three days.
