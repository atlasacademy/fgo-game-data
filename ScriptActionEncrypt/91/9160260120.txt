You see, Lord Yan Qing actually came to apologize[sr]to me once, back when we were still at Chaldea.
[k]

？1：You mean, about what happened in Shinjuku?

＠Cursed Arm
Indeed. You have an excellent memory, Master.
[k]

？2：What about?

＠Cursed Arm
The incident in Shinjuku, most likely.

No, I'll go further: it would be wrong if it did. That would mean the sins we commit would pile higher and higher every time we were summoned.

The heroes from the Age of Gods may be able to endure such a burden, but that is far too much for an ordinary person.
