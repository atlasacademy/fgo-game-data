I'm kinda disappointed I never found another snack other than Illya, but I'll just keep looking on my own time.

And whenever Illya's not around, I'm counting on you to supply me with magical energy, okay Master?

The magical energy necessary for a Servant to manifest is supplied by Chaldea.

＠Mash
That's why...there should be no need to siphon extra from other Servants...let alone from Master!

I know. That's why I've been saying “snack” this whole time.

A healthy lifestyle requires three meals a day, plus delicious snacks in between.
