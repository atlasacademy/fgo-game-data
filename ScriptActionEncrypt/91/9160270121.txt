＠Wu Zetian
(Huff, huff...) You're a resilient one, aren't you...![sr]Why would you go to such lengths?
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
I am not trying to kill you. I only want you to tell me who ordered you to write that letter!

This is not a matter of benefit, but of honor.[sr]I am not one who rules, but one who serves.

[charaFace D 1]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
As such, I cannot hope to imagine what it must feel like to be the empress of a great country.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
But I also cannot imagine that you would easily cast away your honor. Would you?

That said, our Master is there with you. If [&he:she] wishes to make me speak regardless of the consequences, there are ways to go about it.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
I speak, of course, of those powerful charms... Command Spells, I believe they are called. If [&he:she] were to use one, [&he:she] could compel me to speak. However[line 2]
[k]

？1：I wouldn't resort to that!
？！

I am glad to hear that.

Th-that's right. Senpai would never[sr]resort to coercing someone like that!

＠Mash
(Still...I wonder what Yagyu was[sr]going to say after “however”...)
[k]

＠Mash
(Since he's a samurai, the first place my mind went is “However, I will consequently have no choice but to commit seppuku.”)

＠Wu Zetian
It isn't that I could not get you to talk, mind you. Only that it would be more time and trouble than it is worth.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
I'm a busy woman, after all.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Whether I know exactly who sent this foul missive or not, it does not change the fact that I still have other preparations I must make.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
The penalty for writing such insults about me may be stiff, but I can also dole out the necessary punishment just as easily once I return.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Wu Zetian
And as they say, life's greatest pleasures should be savored. Consider yourself lucky, ghost writer who is strangely skilled with the sword!

Heh. I do not know if our Master is wise or foolish...but in time, [&he:she] will learn [&he:she] is lacking.

And it is through that lack that [&he:she] will find new paths open to [&him:her]. Now that I think of it, my old lord was not all that dissimi[line 2]Hm...?
