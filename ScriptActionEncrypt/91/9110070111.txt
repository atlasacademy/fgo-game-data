Pardon me. I simply decided it would be most expedient to skip the annoying explanations of your crimes.

And it appears the collection notice was destroyed in our battle.

Please do not fret. I collected your materials before I burnt that blackguard to cinders.

Eight million QP and one Forbidden Page...?
[k]

＠Gawain
Strange...[sr]That isn't right...
[k]

？2：Does that mean he's already sold everything?

？！

[charaFace A 2]

I see...so this QP is the proceeds...![sr]Wonderful deduction, [%1]!

Hey, you, burning man![sr]To whom did you sell those materials?

I have my pride as a businessman,[sr]young leader of the Britain Group.

Heh heh... I never imagined I of all people could be so possessed by such low greed...

Perhaps I erred in trying to go big in order not to be outdone by the David Credit Union...ungh...

So Caesar Holdings was also a victim of greed...but that doesn't matter.

＠Gawain
[%1], I see some records of transactions for the past few days.
[k]

＠Gawain
By tracing these transactions, we should be able to locate the materials. Do not think of me as nothing more than a wielder of a sacred sword.
[k]

＠Gawain
Investigation is a matter of legwork. Crime must be punished. Wives should be young. These are the basics of being a knight!
[k]

＠Gawain
Master. Will you allow me to continue spearheading this investigation?
[k]

？1：We probably need to reexamine those “basics.”

[charaFace A 6]
＠Gawain
Hahaha, that's what it means to be a land owner.[sr]I was always busy with odd tasks back in the day.
[k]

＠Gawain
I have also heard that there was a rather uninhibited shogun in Japan who concealed his identity and took to the streets to fight crime.
[k]

？2：What about the David Credit Union?

[charaFace A 0]
＠Gawain
We will raid them in due course.[sr]For now, let's concentrate on retrieving those materials.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Gawain
Now that that's settled,[sr]let's take a look at this list.
[k]

＠Gawain
Knowingly purchasing stolen goods is a crime as well![sr]We shall punish these purchasers!
