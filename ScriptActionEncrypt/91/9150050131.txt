＠Andersen
Now I'm satisfied. Good work, [%1].[sr]I had an experience like no other thanks to you.
[k]

＠Mash
...We're finally back.[sr]We had a rough time, huh, Master?
[k]

＠Mash
Aimlessly fighting through all those eras...
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
It was good combat experience for us,[sr]but why did you do it, Mr. Andersen?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Andersen
To observe people, of course. The weapons[sr]people of those eras used, how they fought.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Andersen
Even primitive combat reflects human thought.[sr]The differences of all those eras will make a great reference.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Observe people... Then, you must love mankind. Right, Mr. Andersen?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Andersen
Huh? Don't be stupid![sr]I've no interest in mankind. I just needed data.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Andersen
Not only the soldiers, I learned something about[sr]you two as well. Maybe I will write it into a book someday.
[k]

？1：Thank you for that.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
...Being written about by one of the three greatest fairy tale authors, I'm embarrassed just saying it.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
But I think it would be a great honor.[sr]Dr. Roman would get so jealous.
[k]

？2：I'll pass.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Huh...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Yeah, you're right.[sr]Count me out, too.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...You're a more thoughtful person than I imagined, Senpai...
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Andersen
You two get along so well.[sr]You're so easygoing.
[k]

＠Andersen
I made a contract with you as a Servant because[sr]I had no choice, but now I've changed my mind.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Andersen
It's hard to find partners for this crazy fieldwork, you know.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Andersen
I think I'll get a little more fired up from now on.[sr]A little. Very little. A tiny bit.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
I'm glad I was able to help you write, Mr. Andersen.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Andersen
...Don't you understand that's a separate matter?[sr]This is why I hate my readers...
