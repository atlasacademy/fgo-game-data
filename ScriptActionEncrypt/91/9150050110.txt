＠Andersen
How are you, Master? It's good to see[sr]that you're not looking disgruntled today.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Andersen
I am so disgusted with my super-boring life[sr]that my brain has turned to stone.
[k]

＠Andersen
I feel like as if I've been transformed into a dumb[sr]monkey. I'm overwhelmingly lacking enrichment in my life.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Andersen
Look. Don't you have[sr]anything to say as my Master?
[k]

？1：Stone bread?

？2：Enrichment?

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Andersen
Huh? You don't know the taste of a completely-dried[sr]bread? Scandinavians start their breakfast
[k]

＠Andersen
by forcefully washing down a piece of rock-like bread[sr]with a drink like lead-boiled water...
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Andersen
Well, that trivia aside,[sr]what I want to say, [%1], is...
[k]

＠Andersen
Give me something new to write about, or if you don't have anything, then give me some money.[sr]I'll have some fun at the bar to kill some time.

...Senpai, Mr. Andersen is sounding[sr]more arrogant and reprehensible than ever.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Did you do anything to get on his bad side?
[k]

？1：I didn't do anything.

？2：Andersen is always like this.

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
So you say you're not at fault.[sr]Of course. That's what I remember, too.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Mr. Andersen.[sr]We don't have any resources to waste here at Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Please behave yourself, and work on a new book.[sr]Personally, I request a sequel of The Little Mermaid...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Andersen
Tch.[sr]That story is so popular among women and kids.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Andersen
I wrote that story to mock the idiots in this world,[sr]so I don't understand why it would be taken as a touching tale.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
What[line 3]M-Mister, what did you just say?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Andersen
I said, that is one of the worst trash that I ever wrote, you fool!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Andersen
Geez. I made the ending so obvious,[sr]but people kept calling it a tragedy or tragic love story.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Andersen
Not only is she finally released from love at first sight,[sr]but she even gets a soul as a reward in the end!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Andersen
Listen. The best part about love is when it's purely[sr]yours. That's my conclusion, at least.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Andersen
You ask me to write a sequel, but why can't you[sr]understand it would only drive Little Mermaid to further despair?
[k]

＠Andersen
Uh... What, you look like it's the end of the world.[sr]...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Andersen
I'm saying, don't ask me to write a sequel to a story that[sr]ended already. It's the reader's privilege to imagine what happens after the ending.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Andersen
...Fine. If you don't have any money,[sr]some new inspiration will do.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Andersen
Take me wherever you can, [%1].[sr]France would be nice for now.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Andersen
What are you doing, Mash? You're coming, too.[sr]We'll end up dying if it's just me and [%1].
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
R-Right...

Yes. Anywhere is okay as long as I can stay away from[sr]my desk. Let's enjoy the city of France first...

Master, hostiles approaching! Looks like ghosts from the Hundred Years' War manifested using the Grail's power.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Andersen
Hmm. Soldiers from the past are reappearing?[sr]Interesting, why don't you play with them, [%1]?
[k]

＠Andersen
I'm against physical labor but I will bear with it to get something to write about.[sr]Make this battle a good one, yeah?
