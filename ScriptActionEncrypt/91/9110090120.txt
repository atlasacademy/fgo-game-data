＠Mordred
A ghost, huh. I guess it was lured out[sr]by the fog that formed a little earlier.

？1：What's wrong?

？！

＠Mordred
Never mind, it's nothing.

＠Mordred
The blade of Clarent seems a bit[sr]duller than usual, and it's bothering me.

You're fighting ghosts, after all...

＠Mordred
Not really. If this blade can return to its former splendor,[sr]I could cut my way through anything, ghost or otherwise.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Mordred
...Well, I guess it's my fault. I kind of "appropriated" it.
[k]

？1：Appropriated?

？2：You stole it?

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Mordred
Ah, no.[sr]...I'm just sort of, uh, borrowing it for eternity.
[k]

＠Mordred
I mean, I was still borrowing it when I died.[sr]Thanks to that, I'm still able to use it as a Servant.

I'm getting a life response that seems like a Servant's![sr]Wait! But not quite?

Anyway, I'll send you the route.[sr]Go check it out right away!

If you're naming yourself king, I'll refute that.

＠Mordred
Now and forever, the only one who can name himself[sr]king[line 2] is our King of Knights.

[charaFace C 0]
＠Mordred
And the only one who can oppose the king[sr]is me!
