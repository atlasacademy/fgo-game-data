Hahaha...what do you think!?[sr]Did you see my terrible serpent form!?

That's not what I'm talking about![sr]That's not what you should be saying!
[k]

＠Gorgon
You should be terrified! You should be soiling yourself! You should be begging me not to eat you!
[k]

＠Gorgon
This is the time to beg for your life!
[k]

？1：So, I'm thinking leaving would be a good idea...
？2：I don't think we should stay long...

Ungh...[sr]This human...is unbelievable...!
[k]

＠Gorgon
Argh! Fine! So!?[sr]Do you have any idea how to escape!?
[k]

？1：I don't, but let's just keep going.
？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Gorgon
Hmph. Are you saying we should[sr]simply head in that direction?
[k]

＠Gorgon
The single, obvious way out in a place steeped in nothing but evil on all sides?
[k]

＠Gorgon
I suspect that will only lead us to a hell far worse than the one we find ourselves in now.
[k]

＠Gorgon
But you willingly walk headlong into peril...and you are even willing to peek into the underbelly of the hideous monster I am?
[k]

？1：I'm sure there are parts of yourself you don't want anyone seeing...
？2：We've got to go that way to get out, sorry.
？！

＠Gorgon
Silence. It seems you value neither[sr]your life nor your sanity.
[k]

＠Gorgon
Perhaps you will realize what they were worth once you've lost them. Hehe.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Gorgon
Very well. I'm intrigued.
[k]

＠Gorgon
I shall watch your final moments and mock them to the very end. You may meet your end without fear. Hahaha.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Gorgon
...Hold it right there. Are you a fool?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Gorgon
Did you not think that carelessly venturing out might mean your death? If you simply perished, I would be robbed of my chance to watch a demon devour you.
[k]

＠Gorgon
Just stand behind me and follow me, scum.[sr]Unbelievable...
