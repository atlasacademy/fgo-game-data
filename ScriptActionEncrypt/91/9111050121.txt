That takes care of the monster's entourage,[sr]though they were stronger than I expected.

＠Enkidu
That chimera's Spirit Origin is as strong as the ones from my time. Maybe it's because of how much technology has progressed, or how human desires have built up over time...
[k]

＠Enkidu
Regardless, it would seem this is what it means for a city to grow. Maybe the emergence of some strange beast like this was just inevitable.

The wolf goes after the Demonic[sr]Beast with all his might.
[k]

＠
He can hear his passenger screaming above him,[sr]but Hessian should take care of that.

He does not regret killing his brethren,[sr]but neither is he happy about it.

The wolf continues to run, not stopping[sr]to consider what that might mean.
