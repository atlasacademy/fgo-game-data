Hey Master, you there?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Hektor
You don't have to be so on edge.[sr]I'm your Servant now.
[k]

？1：I'm not on edge.

？2：I'm not worried.

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Hektor
I see. Good. So anyway,[sr]there's something I wanted to talk to you about.
[k]

＠Hektor
Mind if I ask you too, Mash?

N-Not at all. Go ahead...

[charaFace D 1]
＠Hektor
Okay, well I'll get straight to the point.[sr]I'm not using all of my power right now.
[k]

？1：Going easy?

？2：You're strong if you tried?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Hektor
Right. Of course, I'm not trying to go easy or anything,[sr]and I could be powerful if I tried, you know?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Hektor
But my Noble Phantasm...[sr]It's gotten a bit weaker.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Durandal, right? I think you called it...[sr]Durindana, was it?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Hektor
Yeah, that's the name, I think.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Wouldn't it be better for you to remember its[sr]True Name?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Hektor
Well... Ha, ha, ha. To be honest, I don't really care[sr]what lance I have as long as I can throw it.
[k]

＠Hektor
It's natural for great swords and lances[sr]to break left and right on the battlefield.
[k]

＠Hektor
And even if it didn't break, it's lost once you throw it.[sr]So you learn to make do with whatever you've got.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Hektor
To be honest, this old man can even kill someone with a[sr]single stone. Whether they're a Heroic Spirit or not.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Hektor
Well, in any event. This lance is[sr]legendary in later generations.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Hektor
I need to get it sharpened again, ya'know. Let me see.[sr]As long as I can cut down 100 more people with it[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...Then how about you do some training in a[sr]programmed simulation?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Hektor
A virtual battle, huh?[sr]I guess I can't be picky.

Master, what do you think?[sr]Want to help this old man with some training?
[k]

？1：Guess I have to.

？2：Not a problem.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Hektor
Good. Quick answers like that show one's true nature.[sr]You're a great Master after all.
[k]

＠Hektor
All right. Let's go.
