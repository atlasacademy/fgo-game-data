＠Mash
Oh, Senpai.
[k]

＠Mash
Yes, I was just reading.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
I wanted to learn more about Nezha,[sr]so I was re-reading her story.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
I had read “Journey to the West” before, but I learned of “Investiture of the Gods” only recently.
[k]

＠Mash
Have you heard of it?
[k]

？1：Both novels are pretty popular.

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mash
Really?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

？2：I don't think that many people have read the original text...

＠Mash
So there are many spin-off works from the original text.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
Human culture never ceases to amaze me.
[k]

＠Mash
The frequently mentioned Chinese classics are: “Journey to the West,” “Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” “Water Margin,” and “The Plum in the Golden Vase.”
[k]

＠Mash
Though many of the passionate readers switch the “Golden Vase” with “Investiture of the Gods” to insist that it is one of the great classic Chinese novels.
[k]

＠Mash
And some say that the “Investiture of the Gods” is one of the great Chinese classics, along with “Romance of the Three Kingdoms” and “Journey to the West.”
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
I also took a brief look at related Chinese texts...
[k]

＠Mash
But it appears that the lore for Nezha greatly differs from work to work.
[k]

？1：Really?

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
It appears that she has Taoist,[sr]Buddhist, and even Hindu origins.
[k]

＠Mash
Although, that isn't really unique,[sr]even among the Servants we know...
[k]

？2：There's just one question (read: gender) to clear up.

Senpai, here's your coffee. I believe there are certain topics that are best left alone.

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
The Nezha that we know appears to be the most similar to the version from “Journey to the West”...
[k]

＠Mash
The Nezha of “Investiture of the Gods” seems[sr]like a better fit for a Berserker than a Lancer...
[k]

＠Mash
But Nezha is...hard to define. So many characteristics and aspects are jumbled together.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
In “Investiture of the Gods,” many supernatural beings and spirits of various time periods assemble and participate in a bloody melee.
[k]

？1：It's like Chaldea.

＠Mash
If you're likening “Investiture of the Gods” to an all-star battle set during the Ming Dynasty, you would not be far off the mark.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Mash
Though, I would prefer to not use the word “melee”...
[k]

？2：Both Heroic Spirits and humans have hidden sides.

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
True...it's not right to judge others by rumors or titles alone.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
On one hand, Nezha is enshrined as a god in China and Southeast Asia, even in modern times.
[k]

＠Mash
Don't you think it's odd for a god to be depicted as a youth?
[k]

＠Mash
I was very curious about that,[sr]and that's why I went to the library...
[k]

？1：Why don't we just ask Nezha?

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Wouldn't...that be too...bold of us?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
With so many aspects, maybe there are some she would prefer be left alone? Still...
[k]

？2：Long have I awaited this day...

This is that legendary drink called “coffee.”[sr]It's black, so please drink it all down.

Everyone is my teacher in life,[sr]and they are also my friends...

＠Mash
Even were it necessary for a mission,[sr]I'd like to avoid anything that could hurt them...
[k]


[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Though...my curiosity may be[sr]winning out over all that...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
Um...Nezha's schedule for today is...
[k]

＠Mash
It appears that she is participating in a meeting run by the “Buddhist Club.”
[k]

？1：That's new. Where do they meet?

＠Mash
This is the first I heard of the group, as well.
[k]

＠Mash
I've heard of groups like “Old Men Seriously Reading Fairytales” and “Air Basketball Club”...
[k]

？2：How do you know about this club?

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Because I'm aware of all the clubs that are active in Chaldea!
[k]

＠Mash
Well...at least I wanted to be.[sr]I may have exaggerated a bit...
[k]

＠Mash
So actually, an anonymous Japanese Lancer came to me to discuss something, and that's how I heard about it.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

？！

＠Mash
The meeting is held...in the simulator room, it seems.

[k]

？1：Forcing my way in.

[charaFace A 14]

＠Mash
Ah, Senpai!?
[k]

？2：I'd like to join the club.

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
If it's a Buddhist Club, would the conditions to join the club be renouncing the world and becoming a monk?
[k]

？！
