The darkness is starting to clear...[sr]Hehehe... Oh, that was satisfying!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Gorgon
And yet...that was no more than a shadow of my past and future. I know just how pointless it is.
[k]

？1：?
？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Gorgon
Hah! That vacant look...[sr]I can see you do not understand. But I do.
[k]

＠Gorgon
What would you call something that is both satisfying and completely pointless?
[k]

＠Gorgon
...Amusement.
[k]

＠Gorgon
I had an amusing dream. If how I feel now is any indication...I would say it was a sweet dream.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Gorgon
Let me reiterate: I am a monster.
[k]

＠Gorgon
Killing that monster[line 2]that other me[line 2]and bathing in its blood was exhilarating. I found that dream...amusing.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Gorgon
Knowing that...do you still want something like me in your Chaldea?
[k]

？1：Of course.
？！

[charaFace A 2]

＠Gorgon
Why? I've told you time and time again, and you still don't get it!? I am no Heroic Spirit! I AM A MONSTER!
[k]

？1：Whatever you are, you are here now.
？2：You answered my call...
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Gorgon
...You are mistaken.
[k]

＠Gorgon
Even I do not know why I was summoned.[sr]It must have been some kind of accident.
[k]

？1：Even if it's an accident or a mistake, I'm happy.
？2：Thank you for coming to Chaldea.
？！

[charaFace A 2]

＠Gorgon
I said...you...!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Gorgon
(Sigh) So annoying.[sr]Even my hunger has dissipated.

＠Gorgon
...Hmph. It's almost time to wake up.[sr]I failed to devour the moron before me.
[k]

＠Gorgon
...
[k]

＠Gorgon
Perhaps it is the same for humans, but I will likely forget this most amusing dream of mine.
[k]

[charaFadeTime F 1.0 1.0]

＠Gorgon
And if you don't want me to remember[sr]that I failed to devour you...
[k]

＠Gorgon
Do not ever mention what happened in this dream should you recall it. For your own safety.
