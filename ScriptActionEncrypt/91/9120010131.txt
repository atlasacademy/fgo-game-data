It was rude of me to assume you needed those lectures.[sr][%1] already has many wonderful Servants.

[charaFace D 6]
＠Emiya
With Mash Kyrielight at your side, you won't be easily defeated.
[k]

＠Emiya
You have a long journey ahead of you.[sr]You'll learn through experience, not words.

Good. Go at your own pace, and don't rush.[sr]You'll do yourself no good pushing too hard.

Um, Emiya.[sr]No, Servant Archer.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I was wondering.[sr]Why are you being so nice to us?
[k]

＠Mash
Other Servants are interested in Senpai's skills.[sr]You're the only one who cares what Senpai thinks.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Emiya
It's simple.[sr]Now that you're my Master, I need you to succeed.
[k]

＠Emiya
It's business. A form of advertising.[sr]I want people to know that my Masters succeed.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Emiya
If word gets around, the next time I'm summoned I can ask for a higher price, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
...Um, in other words, it's for your own benefit?
[k]

＠Mash
So this is for us, and for yourself too?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Emiya
Yes, that's right.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Emiya
For one thing, it would damage my reputation to leave[sr]an inexperienced young [&boy:girl].
[k]

＠Emiya
A true Servant helps their Master grow, and thus enhances their own reputation.
