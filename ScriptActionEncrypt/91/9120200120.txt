＠Ishtar
Teehee. Since half of everything here is mine,[sr]I can just start taking whatever catches my eye, right?
[k]

？1：Indeed.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ishtar
Yep, yep![sr]Now you're starting to understand! Woo!
[k]

？2：That's how conquerors usually talk.

[charaFace A 9]

＠Ishtar
Th-that's not true! I deserve this reward![sr]I worked really, really hard, if you recall!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Ishtar
I even shattered the foundation of my own city, Uruk![sr]It was REALLY hard fixing everything after that!
[k]

...Ishtar, would you mind if I asked you a question?

＠Mash
I believe your shrine is already overflowing with wealth. Why do you love treasure so much?

...What do you mean?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Ishtar
You think precious gems are beautiful because of how they sparkle in the light.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Mash
Right.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Ishtar
So, would you be able to tell the difference between a precious gem and a pebble in total darkness?
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Mash
No... I wouldn't be able to sense the difference in their magical energy, either.

＠Ishtar
Exactly.[sr]So in this example, I am the light.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Gems I do not own are in the dark.[sr]They simply exist, and are no different than pebbles.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Once they are mine, the gems can properly shine, and those shining gems repay me for my light by making me more beautiful.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I'm not sure if it's because of my innate Divinity, or if it is just how things happened...
[k]

＠Ishtar
...but that doesn't matter.[sr]The point is: I love things that enhance my beauty.
[k]

＠Ishtar
And that's not just limited to treasures.[sr]The reason why I rule beauty, war, and the harvest...
[k]

＠Ishtar
...is that the ideal state of those Authorities is to belong to me. And things are at their most beautiful when they are in their proper place...right?

You know...I don't remember being quite this infatuated with gems in the past...
[k]

[charaFace A 14]

＠Ishtar
But now, whenever I see gems, I get this antsy feeling and can't help but think I need to collect as many as I can, whenever I can!

That is likely an influence from your current vessel, Ishtar.

It's not as if my tastes have changed, just gotten stronger. It might just be a phase.

[charaFace A 1]

Oh look, look! That door![sr]That door looks like it's hiding amazing treasure!

You're right... Its decorations are overwhelmingly ornate, and all based on Ishtar's tastes...
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Mash
But why would there be a door like that inside the treasury...
[k]

？1：Oh, good. That's not suspicious at all...
？2：Obvious trap is obvious.

？！

＠Mash
I concur, Master.[sr]I sense only danger.
