U-Umu, this went too far.[sr]I've realized my mistake here...

＠Nero
But with this much material here, let's start building![sr]I'll show you how mankind first started using concrete!
[k]

？1：In what pose will you build the statue?

＠Nero
Hm...I have to think about that...
[k]

...Sorry. I'll build the statue later.[sr]These golems make for good materials, but...

[charaFace C 4]
＠Nero
They just don't have the right appeal.[sr]The voices I hear from the stones are the brawny types.
[k]

＠Nero
I can't carve a good statue with this.[sr]I've given up on the Colosseum style this time.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Nero
But I will rebuild the Theater.[sr]Don't worry, I won't waste your effort Master.

[charaFace C 2]
＠Nero
Now it's time to really get to work! Let's get the[sr]materials together and make our triumphant return to Rome!
[k]

＠Nero
We're going to make my Theater strong, firm, and as tough as a fortress...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Nero
That's right, something Heracles can't even handle.[sr]The strongest Theater yet!
