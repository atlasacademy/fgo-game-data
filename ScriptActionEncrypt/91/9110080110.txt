＠Siegfried
Ah Master, Mash Kyrielight, I need a word with you...[sr]Is now a good time?
[k]

？1：I don't mind.

？2：Not a problem.

？！

...I see.[sr]Well, where to start...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Siegfried
You know how I am the "Dragon Slayer?"
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Of course, you defeated the evil dragon Fafnir, didn't you?
[k]

＠Siegfried
Yes. Afterward I bathed in its blood[line 2][sr]and gained immortality from it.
[k]

＠Siegfried
Although, there is one part which was[sr]untouched by its blood. My back.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Siegfried
...Well, that I'm aware of, at least.
[k]

？1：Why wasn't it touched?

？2：Why did you leave it?

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Siegfried
Let's just say I had my reasons.[sr]I'm terrible at explaining this.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Siegfried
You see, because I bathed in Fafnir's blood[line 2][sr]I can resonate with "that dragon."
[k]

＠Siegfried
You could say it's like the relationship between Masters and Servants.
[k]

＠Siegfried
However, the link is extremely weak. It only[sr]allows us to confirm each other's survival at best.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Siegfried
During the battle in France, I was certain that Fafnir was destroyed, but...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Siegfried
It seems it's revived.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Wha...Fafnir has?!
[k]

＠Siegfried
Master, I beg of you.[sr]Return to France, and this time slay the dragon.
[k]

＠Siegfried
Won't you take me with you?

All right, I'll start monitoring...[sr]Multiple signatures of lifeforms confirmed.

...In any case, they must be destroyed.[sr]Aim for the wyverns first. Let's go!
