＠Cú Chulainn
Cleaned up for the most part? You could say it[sr]was done as planned but rough, you know?
[k]

＠Mash
...Cú Chulainn. Do you have any idea about[sr]the distortion that's left in the 1st Century?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
Yeah, I do.[sr]I'm Cú Chulainn, an Ulster hero, you know.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
I'm not used to this calendar style called century, but, this is "my era."
[k]

？1：True, come to speak of it.

？2：Oh, really!?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes, Senpai.[sr]This is the era in which he was alive[line 2]
[k]

＠Mash
The specific period of Celt and Ulster legends are[sr]presumed to be from 100 B.C. to 100 A.D.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
Precisely. That said, the me that was alive[sr]already "died" decades ago by now.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
For some reason, I feel attached to this era.[sr]I don't know why, I can just feel something.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
Maybe that's also because I manifested as a Caster, oddly, I am more keen at picking up magical energy.

I see. That's why you were able to sense the[sr]distortion happening here in your hometown.

My hometown, you say.[sr]Still, I think it's because I'm a Caster.

[charaFace C 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
[line 2]It's the forest.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
[FFFFFF]??[-]
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
I'm a Celtic, a man of Ulster.[sr]If I'm a mage then that can only mean I became "that."
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
A "Druid".
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
The runes I use are originated from Norse legends, but Celtic mages are normally Druids.
[k]

？1：Druids?

？2：So Celtic shamans.

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes, Senpai.[sr]The Celtic priests are referred to as Druids.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
They are people who have a deep relationship with the forest and monument, and can perform mystics same as the magecrafts we know.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
Of course, they existed in my times, too.[sr]However, I am not actually a Druid.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
Like I said before, the type of magecraft I use is runes.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
I combine the rune characters here and there and to perform the mystics.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
However, there's an exception.[sr]When I manifested in this form[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
I obtained it as a "Noble Phantasm."[sr]It was given to me since I was a Celtic mage.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...Wicker Man, the Cage of All-Consuming Flame.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Right. A Flame Noble Phantasm given to me after[sr]becoming a Celtic mage who could manipulate blazing heat.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Originally, it's a Noble Phantasm for Druids, since it was a magical tool used in sacrificial offerings.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
That's what summoned me here, telling me to stop the distortion.

!?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Bingo! That's the one distorting this forest and preventing the correction of this era.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
That thing is a "Druid."[sr]But also more than that.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Fearing the incineration of worlds, a cluster of madness.[sr]A collection of dead souls who couldn't ascend to the Throne of Heroes.
