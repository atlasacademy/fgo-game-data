I'm not like that, but...Artemis![sr]Your love is a bit too aggressive!
[k]

＠Martha
First of all, love should be tender, even when you're hurting your beloved.

No. If it truly was a mutual love, no married man would so casually hit on another woman.

Even if Orion is guilty, I can see that Artemis also has need for improvement and reform.
