＠Holmes
Fascinating.
[k]

＠Holmes
So two different versions of the same Heroic Spirit now coexist in one Spirit Origin? Hmm...
[k]

＠Holmes
I suppose it is not totally dissimilar from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde's case, though for you it seems to be a more temporary phenomenon.
[k]

＠Holmes
Especially given how the Saber version seems to have made his way here via the connection he made to Ms. Miyamoto in a parallel world.
[k]

＠Holmes
That particular Spirit Origin has, of course,[sr]been registered in our database by now...
[k]

＠Holmes
...but I'm afraid that your current self can only maintain its manifestation for so long.

You might as well enjoy yourself while you're here. This should be fun!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So, I'll put a little more in the way of resources into the simulator while you're here.

＠Da Vinci
After all, we're Chaldea, the Security Organization for the Preservation of Humanity. You won't find this many Servants anywhere else! Ever!
[k]

I, um... Are you sure about this?[sr]I never belonged to this world, after all.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
Are you certain it will not be a problem[sr]to keep me here, even temporarily?
[k]

？1：It's fine! Don't worry about it!
？2：What's Lancer Diarmuid think?

？！

Go on. What's he saying?
[k]

＠Diarmuid

[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Kiyohime
Then listen to him![sr]Please, enjoy yourself.
