Not at all. Actually, this is fun! My job normally doesn't let me accompany you like this.
[k]

？！

＠Da Vinci
To freely walk around, huh...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Since we are shorthanded at Chaldea, it somehow became my job to build up the anti-infiltration program.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
It's not a particularly taxing job, but day and night, it's just been work, work, work.

Buuut, ever since you formed a contract with me, I've been able to get involved in battle...

Right? That's why I'm really happy. I'm excited![sr]If it was fieldwork, it would have been even better.

Fieldwork...?

If I'm outside, I can go all-out. Making a bonfire in a place like this is frowned upon, you know.

Anyway. So, is this labyrinth the source of London's abnormality?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Da Vinci seems to be convinced that it is, and the fact that we encountered demonic books is all the proof we need.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But the readings on my side aren't all that clear.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Mage's Association bounded field that was originally there has reappeared, and it's interfering with our ability to gather information.

That's why I'm a bit saddened.[sr]I didn't want our reunion to be like this.

＠Da Vinci
During my time, I had not a single equal.

＠Da Vinci
I was a genius, after all. And not just any genius.[sr]A universal genius.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The talents that I was born with were not limited to any single field. Painting, sculpting, architecture, carpentry, anatomy, natural science...

＠Da Vinci
Ah yes, and magecraft.[sr]All fields of human knowledge were my playground.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
There was nobody who was equal to me.[sr]Everyone trailed behind.
