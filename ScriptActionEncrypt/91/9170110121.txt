Excuse me, Darius.[sr]Why did you come to this era?
[k]

＠Mash
Did you bring us here because you sensed something, and figured out why the monsters were showing up?
[k]

？1：This is ancient Rome, after all.

？2：Maybe there's someone here he knows?

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes. I'm sure there's some phenomenon[sr]here that's related to him[line 2]

Ahh... Yes. So it seems. Well, there does[sr]seem to be some phenomenon related to him.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
We've just finished a preliminary analysis, and the origin of the skeleton soldier and ghost spawning is

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
[line 2]the presence of His Majesty Darius himself!

＠Dr. Roman
Yes. Well, you see, it's the[sr]Noble Phantasm he carries. "Athanaton Ten Thousand."
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That Noble Phantasm is based on his ten thousand elite soldiers who actually existed, and his legend of unyielding valor.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Along with the legend of their "immortality," they've actually ended up becoming indestructible...

That's what's behind this. His Noble Phantasm[sr]is able to summon skeleton soldiers and ghosts.

＠Dr. Roman
This location is the recent battlefield where Nero's[sr]Roman Army and the United Empire Army clashed.
[k]

That's why the undead kept showing up.
