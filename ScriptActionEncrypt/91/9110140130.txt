Senpai, we should make a bet.

Yes, I think so as well.

Hah hah hah! Master, you're quite harsh.[sr]However, rest assured. This is a tent, thus, the wild.
[k]

＠Fergus
Being here means it will most likely be a ferocious woman, a warrior!
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Fergus
I know well how to woo such a woman. Well now, Doctor!

Honestly, I'm starting to realize this is useless, so I want to go back to work... But I hope for the best this time!

Oooh, is this not the nurse that took care of us in America?

I only have business for the wounded. Please leave.

＠Fergus
Don't be so cold.[sr]Actually... I have a serious illness.

＠Nightingale
...Let's hear it. What is wrong?
[k]

＠Fergus
Uh, it's like a gaping hole has opened in my chest...
[k]

＠Nightingale
Is it pneumothorax?[sr]Or perhaps heart failure?
[k]

＠Fergus
Nothing like that, it's more of a mental problem. I've got an emptiness from the lonely nights spent alone.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Nightingale
...Meaning?
[k]

＠Fergus
Yes, I refer to the disease of love...[sr]My [charaFace D 2]heart is unspeakably cold and empty!
[k]

＠Fergus
But, my beautiful lady with bosom so supple and buttocks so round!
[k]

＠Fergus
I do think you are capable of filling the gap in this chest. If you would, please!

No. On the battlefield, it's just an unavoidable instinct for warriors to seek proof that they have lived.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Assaulting helpless nurses is one thing.[sr]But, if I am the one nominated, that's a different story.
