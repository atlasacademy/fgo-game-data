Uruk was in better shape after being attacked by Gugalanna than this place is now.

We've operated for an entire year with only Chaldea's own stockpile of supplies. I hope you'll take that into consideration. Besides...

I'm not really one of his defenders, but the acting director is doing a great job.

Chaldea could easily have been utterly destroyed when it lost its director.

But Romani was the one who helped everyone back to their feet. Had I been at the helm, well...
