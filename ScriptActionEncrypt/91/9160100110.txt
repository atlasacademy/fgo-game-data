...Treasure hunting?
[k]

＠Stheno
No, it is a bit different.[sr]The purpose of this request is different from before.
[k]

＠Stheno
What I want to ask you is to hunt down the one[sr]who wrecked the place where I hid the treasure.
[k]

＠Stheno
The place is, yes, where I previously materialized.[sr]The Shaped Isle[line 2]in the 1st Century.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
I remember.[sr]It's a tiny island in the Mediterranean Sea.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Stheno
Yes.[sr]On that island, I hid away many treasures.
[k]

＠Stheno
I thought I could go reclaim them if I was summoned[sr]as a Heroic Spirit again, like now.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Stheno
But when I went there to check things out, the peaceful paradise was no more.
[k]

＠Stheno
I'm sure back in the 1st Century[sr]some wretch dug the treasures up.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I...see?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Stheno
As far as I can tell, the culprits most certainly are undead monsters.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Stheno
What do you say, everyone.[sr]You just need to drive them out of that place.
[k]

＠Stheno
Can't you do it for me?[sr]Doctor Romani?

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
If it's the request from the beautiful goddess Stheno, I'd love to accept it, however[line 2]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Back at the Second Singularity, you asked us something really unreasonable...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We just figured...[sr]This time is going to be the same...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Stheno
Oh, what a shame.[sr]Can't you do it, for me?
[k]

Hey, [%1]. My master.[sr]It's my request, you'd do it for me, right?

Answer her properly.[sr]Senpai, you are her master.

Heheh, can you not call it a skill, please?[sr]It is exactly what I am.
[k]

＠Stheno
I am a goddess. I am a phenomenon born[sr]with the wish to captivate any and every hero.
[k]

＠Stheno
Like I said.[sr]I'm sorry about it, but.
[k]

＠Stheno
Please, come with me.[sr]I'm sure it will be a very fun event, so do your best.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I feel the phrases "very fun" and "do your best"[sr]sound contrary to one another[line 2]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Looks like you've regained sanity.[sr]I'm glad.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
We're on the Shaped Isle in the 1st Century, which we visited during the correction of the Second Singularity.
[k]

＠Mash
Senpai, this is due to you and the Doctor[sr]accepting to take on Stheno's "request."
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
So...Is there anything else I need to explain?
[k]

？1：It's okay, I remember now.

All for our beautiful goddess Lady Stheno... As Lady Stheno commanded, we must protect her treasure!
[k]

We will risk our lives to eliminate the intruders![sr]Although we don't have any lives to risk!

[charaFace A 14]

[k]

？1：What? Then the real culprits are...

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
I-I'm sure that's it!
[k]

[charaFace A 14]

Not, not exactly[line 2]
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 14]

"We are the culprits" here![sr]As I thought, Stheno was pulling a prank on us!
[k]

＠???
Go home, go home![sr]We won't give you the treasures, go home!
[k]

＠???
Woooo! Lady Stheno, woooo![sr]We won't forgive the intruders!!
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
Charm works even on undead monsters...[sr]No, this is the power of a goddess born to be loved!
[k]

＠Mash
Senpai, they're coming![sr]We can't avoid combat!
