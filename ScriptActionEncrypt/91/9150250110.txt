But it doesn't hurt to try, right? With upcoming battles in mind, strengthening a Noble Phantasm is essential.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Edison
But seeing how I'm failing to make progress,[sr]I may need to change my way of thinking...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

Change one's way of thinking...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
If I recall correctly, turning inventions or unimaginable discoveries into something more polished...
[k]

＠Mash
That was the greatest triumph for Thomas Edison...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Why don't you try improving your Noble Phantasm with the same mindset?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Edison
Hmm, I suppose you're right.
[k]

＠Edison
However, I find myself at a loss when thinking only about my own Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Edison
Perhaps if I use the Noble Phantasms of other Servants as reference...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
O-Other Servants... You say?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Edison
Very well then!
[k]

＠Edison
Let's start making contact with other Servants in Chaldea right away!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
But are you sure that's okay? A Noble Phantasm is the embodiment of a Servant's pride...
[k]

＠Mash
To be so openly investigative about their abilities is somewhat...
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Edison
Who cares if it's okay or not![sr]For the time being, we need to try!

I've been thinking about it for some time.
[k]

＠Edison
Cú Chulainn's Gáe Bolg can overturn fate,[sr]piercing its target no matter what course it takes.
[k]

＠Edison
On the other hand, Lady Medea's Rule Breaker not only destroys all magical support...
[k]

＠Edison
...it's also an Anti-Magecraft Noble Phantasm even capable of severing a Servant's contract!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Medea
Actually, the thought has occurred to me before.
[k]

＠Medea
Approaching enemies for each Rule Breaker isn't really a Caster's job, right?
[k]

＠Medea
It's tiresome, dangerous, you get splashed with blood, and you almost trip stepping on the hem of your robe.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Medea
So, if you could quickly activate a Noble Phantasm with that lance of yours, that'd be perfect.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Medea
I mean, I didn't obtain my Noble Phantasm from my adventures. It's a materialization of my legend of treachery.
