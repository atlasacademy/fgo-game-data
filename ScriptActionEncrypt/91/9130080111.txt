Not detecting any other Laḫmu in your area. It looks like those that had been headed your way are retreating back into the forest.

My, oh, my. The sight of those things leaves quite the impression on one's memory. I would not be surprised if a normal person went insane upon seeing them!

Hmmm, looks like those creatures[sr]weren't the cause of the rift.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I had an eye on the readings during the battle,[sr]and it looks like the rift is what's creating them.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I hate to even say it, but it's possible that there's something like a remnant of Tiamat in the forest...

I don't think that's very likely.[sr]After all, gradual as it may be, the reading is dissipating.

＠Da Vinci
Even if we left it alone, there's a chance that whatever the issue is might be corrected in the Restoration of Humanity.

Were I some manner of living residue of a Demon God Pillar, or harbored enough malice, I would gladly offer myself up to be reused. Not a bad deal for debris.

Knew you'd say that.[sr]Don't worry. We'll back you up.

＠Da Vinci
Hah! If we had any in storage, we'd have used them already. Honestly, maybe you could actually go out and collect some to supply Chaldea, hmm?
