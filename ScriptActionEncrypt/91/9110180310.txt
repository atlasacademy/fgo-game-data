...So we meet again.
[k]

＠Altera
Rather, do you still remember?
[k]


？1：Of course I do.

？2：It was in a dark and stormy wasteland...

？！

[charaFace C 1]
＠Altera
I see. So you...remember that.
[k]


[charaFace C 4]
＠Altera
How strange... Or perhaps not. I have come to understand that human memories are unpredictable.
[k]

＠Altera
I may be repeating myself, but I shall explain the bare minimum...
[k]


＠Altera
We are within my memories.[sr]The memory that equates to a dark wasteland.
[k]

＠Altera
Regardless, this place has nothing of value.
[k]

＠Altera
To rephrase, this is the memory of my birth.
[k]

＠Altera
If this dark wasteland was formed using memories of my life...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Altera
...then my life was...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
No, this place was given shape by memories created before I walked my so-called life.
[k]

？1：Is this your birthplace?

？2：Were you born here?

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
This is where I was discovered, where I awakened[line 3]this cave.
[k]

＠Altera
A darkened ruin. Remnants of a civilization thousands of years ago...or so I hear.
[k]


[charaFace C 4]
＠Altera
How do you see it?[sr]I can only see it as a dark cave...
[k]



[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
This is an ancient ruin left in the Sahara Desert.[sr]Within, the Hun elders sought me out.
[k]

＠Altera
To be exact, I was not born a Hun.
[k]


＠Altera
But the ones who raised me and made me into their king were undoubtedly the Hun elders.
[k]

＠Altera
In my youth, after killing a soldier for the first time, I was told...
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Altera
...That I exist to fight.
[k]

＠Altera
This crest of war on my flesh, and this sword of the War God... I had them from the very beginning.
[k]


＠Altera
I had no father or mother. I was simply discovered by the descendants of the Huns.
[k]

＠Altera
I was asked to become destruction itself.[sr]So[charaFace C 0]...
[k]

＠Altera
That is what I did. I became destruction incarnate.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Altera
...I did not want to kill. Yet I did not and still do not understand the so-called value of life.
[k]

＠Altera
I do not know many things. Oh, how I do not know so very much of this world's matters.
[k]

＠Altera
If things are taken, broken, killed...what becomes of it?
[k]

＠Altera
These things simply vanish from this land for eternity.
[k]

＠Altera
It's simple. It's plain and simple.
[k]

＠Altera
Destruction is...something easily accomplished, yet irreversible.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
However, my existence adapted well to the act.
[k]

？1：...Did it pain you?

？2：Are you sad?

？！

＠Altera
Who knows. That is a difficult question for me.
[k]

＠Altera
It's what you call emotions, correct? I know.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
I understand that others possess them.[sr]However, I cannot feel.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Altera
What exists within me is only...
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Altera
No. Let's speak of it later.
[k]


＠Altera
I might have worried too much over small matters...[sr]It looks like that thing from the wasteland has come to pursue me.

Now, let us battle, like we always do.[sr]I won't mind if you just step aside and watch.
[k]

？1：I'll fight.

？2：I can't leave you like this.

？！

＠Altera
...I see. Then let's go.
