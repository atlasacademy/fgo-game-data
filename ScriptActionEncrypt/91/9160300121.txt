It's the record of a certain day. A day that transpired after Kashin Koji and the first Fuuma were gone...

It was still a turbulent time of war...but for me at least, things had calmed down considerably at this point.

I'll go catch some fish and game then!

I also killed a rabbit I can use to make soup.[sr]You need as much nourishment as you can get.
