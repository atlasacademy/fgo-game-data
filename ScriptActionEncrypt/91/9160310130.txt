This hall is very long...but my[sr]Stalking Skill is never wrong.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
And right now, it's telling me it won't be long until we see Batty in person.

Grr. So you finally made it, Kiyo-yo and Ma-chan...
[k]

＠Osakabehime
But I'm daijo... I'm okay. You can leave now. I'm essentially just hiding out in my kotatsu, anyway.

＠Kiyohime
You need to go outside sometimes, Batty.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Osakabehime
No I don't. What's wrong with staying in?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
You're only being halfway honest about this. You want to go out, but you also don't want to go out.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Osakabehime
...It doesn't make any sense, does it?
[k]


＠Osakabehime
I have been enjoying myself here,[sr]thanks to Ma-chan giving me the push I needed.
[k]

＠Osakabehime
But...[twt 0.7][charaFace B 2]it's also so exhausting!

＠Kiyohime
I understand. Okay then, let's fight it out.

＠Kiyohime
Master wants to help you,[sr]and you want to turn [&him:her] away.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Kiyohime
We could talk it out for days and never get anywhere. Violence, on the other hand, is a much faster solution.
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠Osakabehime
I [messageShake 0.05 3 3 0.8]think you might be spending too much time with Tomoe[sr]these days, Kiyo-yo! You're starting to sound just like her!
[k]

？1：Can we at least try talking this out first?

Now that was just an outright lie.

＠Kiyohime
You have something you want to talk about,[sr]and there's something you're hiding.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
But you're too embarrassed to share.

If that's what I gotta do to maintain my hiko lifestyle for a while, I'll meet violence with violence!
