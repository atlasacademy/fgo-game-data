Hey, you're here Captain[line 3][sr]I mean [%1].

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
We see each other all the time,[sr]but talking to you like this feels like old times, somehow.

Me too, Captain.[sr]I'm sure Senpai feels the same way.

＠Dr. Roman
That's right. Although it's like our voyage with Captain Drake never happened, we still remember it clearly.

I don't remember it at all. When Mash says "I'm happy[sr]to see you again," I have no idea what she means.
[k]

＠Drake
But still, I get all weepy thinking "yeah, there was that,"[sr]so you must be telling the truth.

Aww, enough with the mushy stuff.[sr]I came here to talk about something fun!
[k]

？1：Something fun?

？2：Making money?

？！

＠Drake
That's right! I may be out of the pirate business,[sr]but I've still got my sea legs, Captain!

＠Drake
I heard something interesting.[sr]A story about an island with buried treasure.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
How about it? Want to go have some fun?[sr]The more of these, the better, right?

Haha! Don't worry about it, Mash. I like[sr]the sound of the word treasure island! Adventure awaits!

＠Dr. Roman
[%1], let's take Captain Drake up[sr]on her kind offer.

So, Captain,[sr]which sea in particular is this treasure island?

Yeah? That was nothing bad...[sr]The ship only flew up in the air twice, right?

＠Dr. Roman
Ships aren't supposed to fly up in the air, Captain...[sr]I got seasick watching it on the monitor. How bad is it...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Drake
Does it matter? We made it to the island.[sr]And we're the first ones here.

But well...[sr]It looks like we've got a welcoming committee.
