＠David
I think it's about time we got to the boss.
[k]

＠David
Thanks to you, this Singularity was corrected, so the land should have returned to its natural state.
[k]

＠David
But somehow, an army of giants has invaded,[sr]come to destroy this blessed land.
[k]

＠David
And when considering who must be leading them...
[k]

？1：Golyat?
？2：What was it again?

The battle between David and Golyat is a legend written in the Book of Samuel, but you're currently in the 13th century. So, that means...

He's probably not the real Golyat.[sr]If he was real, things would have been much worse.
[k]

＠David
This is a reenactment of the legend.[sr]It must be symbolic in some way.
[k]

＠David
And that's why I'm here. I'm here as the real,[sr]soon-to-be king of the unified Kingdom of Israel.
[k]

＠David
Which means the Golyat we should soon meet will probably be close to the real[line 2]

Yeah, well all three of them have AOE attacks...and you could make the case that each of them is a giant...

[charaFace A 1]
＠David
Yeah. Big things would do AOE attacks.[sr]Pretty much common sense in my world.
