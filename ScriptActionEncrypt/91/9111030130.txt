They don't even know who they should hate anymore.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
If other people were to visit this town during the course of Humanity restoring itself, they would be possessed and slaughtered.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Jeanne Alter
...If you want to stop that from happening, you have to exorcise every ghost here.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
However, they have not sinned, and they don't deserve any punishment. But it would be too late for them once their hate finally manifested.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I'm sure salvation is still possible for these poor souls since they haven't killed anyone.

...[%1], I'm sure you've realized by now...the source of such a grudge, such hatred in innocent spirits...

＠Geronimo
Jeanne Alter, who brought you here.[sr]She is the source.

More specifically, the Jeanne Alter of this Singularity.

Naturally. The Jeanne Alter responsible for that crime has already been defeated.
[k]

＠Geronimo
There's no reason to force the newly summoned[sr]Jeanne Alter to atone for the sins of her old self.
[k]

＠Geronimo
But then...[sr]Why did she manifest as an Avenger?

Now I understand what you're trying to say, Geronimo.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Does the fallen maiden have the intention of fulfilling her duty as a Servant to help restore Humanity?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
If not, she's unfit to be [%1]'s Servant.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
She would just be a crazed woman who uses her status as a Servant to satisfy her own twisted desires.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Cú Chulainn
The real question is...[sr]Which one are you?

I thought that I'd at least enjoy taking my revenge.

But if I'm being honest... I'm not enjoying this at all.[sr]It's actually boring me out of my skull.

[k]

＠Geronimo
However, exorcising these poor souls will not bring you salvation either.
[k]

＠Geronimo
So, why? Why do you persist?

What do I need salvation for?[sr]I'm just a fleeting dream.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Even if I pour everything I have into that effort, I will leave nothing behind. And that's fine. That's just the hand I was dealt.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I'm not here to atone for my sins, nor am I here to seek salvation. I'm here for one purpose and one purpose only: to bring you victory.
