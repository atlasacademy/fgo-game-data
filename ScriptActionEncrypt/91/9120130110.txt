Don't drop your guard even in a battle simulation, or else you'll get hurt. Even here, you'll go numb, right?

It's not just trees you'll be running into.[sr]There's beasts and monsters about too.

Yeah, a forest is nature's home.[sr]So of course, there are monsters here.

The mages would call it... “Mystics,” was it?[sr]They may be rare, but monsters are a part of nature.

[charaFace B 1]

They were common in my day.[sr]The king I served was a descendant of a dragon slayer.

Real dragons are rare, but they do exist out there.

＠Arash
They say there aren't many left these days, but the Rayshifts send you to the past, right?

So stay focused in the forest. Mash, the Doctor, and the other Servants can protect you.

You're the core of the battle, [%1]. We need your power to summon Heroic Spirits and use Command Spells.
