That takes care of all the monsters[sr]we can see...but now, Abigail is gone.
[k]

＠Nezha
She fled. Deeper into the base!
[k]

＠Nezha
I will pursue!
[k]

＠Geronimo
What about them?

＠Nezha
I will not. Let. These ghouls. Have their way![sr]I will wipe them out. Before. They run rampant!
[k]

＠Geronimo
Wait. We must not let them overwhelm us.[sr]Remember, this is only a dream.
[k]

＠Geronimo
We may both be fighting for control, but this other Abigail still holds most of the cards.
[k]

＠Geronimo
These last battles have shown me that[sr]even the time we spend here is uncertain.
[k]

＠Nezha
That means. We should. Tell. The others. And call for. More help. Who shall. Return to. Reality?
[k]

＠Nezha
We can. Expect that. More ghouls. Await us.
[k]

？1：...Wait.
？2：Please let me handle this by myself.
？！

[charaFace B 2]
＠Nezha
...What!? Master. Have you. Gone mad!?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Geronimo
...Can you tell us why?
[k]

？1：I want to talk Abby down from this myself.
？2：We're not the only ones who're scrambling here.

？1：...I think there's something Abby still needs.
？2：Abby's not quite like other Servants.
？！

？1：Sometimes, people get so distraught they don't know what to do.
？2：Sometimes, people need help, but don't know how to ask for it.
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Geronimo
In other words...you think the Abigail from Salem...
[k]

＠Geronimo
...and the one here at Chaldea[sr]are still growing up, do you?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Geronimo
...You do have a point. I'm sure it is no coincidence that she manifested here as the same sensitive girl she was during the chaos of the witch trials.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Servant or not, this summoning karma[sr]is a cruel burden for anyone to bear.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Nezha
If you. Ask me. It is. A fall. From grace.
[k]

＠Nezha
Neither growth. Nor sublimation. But a fall.[sr]She is. Indulging in. Her own. Inner wickedness.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Nezha
As a. Foreigner class. She is. Very dangerous. She is. Attracted to. The evil. In the. Endless abyss.
[k]

＠Nezha
We need. To keep. An eye. On her. At all times to.[sr]Ensure she. Does not. Spiral. Out of control.
[k]

？1：I think she's just lost right now.
？2：Blaming her for not doing the right thing isn't going to help right now.
？！

...Now I understand, my friend. You will provide the weary traveler with shelter and respite.
[k]

？1：That's giving me too much credit.
？2：I don't know about that, but I will do my best to cheer her up.
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Geronimo
...Very well. If that is what you want,[sr]Master, I will not interfere.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Nezha
What!? So you. You mean. Both of. Us will.[sr]Leave Master. Alone in. This dream?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Geronimo
If our goal is to have Abigail let her guard down, I think that it is a better option than for me to chase after her, weapon in hand.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Besides, I am not the one who saved her in Salem.[sr]That was you and Master, Nezha.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Nezha
...Considering... Understood.[sr]I agree. Though reluctantly.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Nezha
But if. Something seems. Wrong in.[sr]Any way. I will. Return immediately.
