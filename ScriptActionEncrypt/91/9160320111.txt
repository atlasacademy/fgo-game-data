You are mistaken, good elder.
[k]

＠Semiramis
Had you not married her,[sr]she would have died without so much as a name.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Semiramis
...Yes, that's right.[sr]This was the best choice I could make.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Semiramis
Allow me to apologize to you on her behalf.
[k]

＠Semiramis
Your life would have been a happier[sr]one had you not married her.
[k]

＠Semiramis
In exchange for her hand,[sr]you will end your days in desperation.

You mean you didn't know? That was my ex-husband.[sr]In modern terms, we used to...hook up? No, that sounds...wrong.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Semiramis
I was all alone at the time, so I didn't care what[sr]he was like as long as he was willing to marry me...
[k]

＠Semiramis
...but he was a far better man than I had ever imagined. I'd been prepared for the worst, so it was shocking how easily we got along.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Semiramis
...Of course, as I alluded to earlier,[sr]our end was not a happy one.
[k]

＠Semiramis
There was a man by the name of Ninus who[sr]fell in love with me the moment he saw me.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Semiramis
Ninus took me from Onnes, and Onnes ended up taking his own life in despair.
[k]

？1：So you wanted to change the past to help him?

[charaFace B 0]

＠Semiramis
...No. I would never be who I am[sr]now if he had not married me.
[k]

？2：So you wanted to see what a different future might have been like?

[charaFace B 0]

＠Semiramis
There may have been a future where[sr]he did not end up dying in misery.
[k]

＠Semiramis
But in that future, I would have been lost to history,[sr]never having had a name.
[k]

？！

＠Semiramis
Still...this old man is an indelible part of my memories.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Semiramis
I merely thought that,[sr]if it were possible to save him...
[k]

＠Semiramis
...I might even go so far as to entrance a saint.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Semiramis
Hmph, I need not have bothered.[sr]People never change.
[k]

＠Semiramis
They hold fast to ideals of change,[sr]yet also see beauty in remaining steadfast.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Semiramis
In the end, any change is but illusion.[sr]An illusion that it seems I fell prey to, however briefly.

Hmm.

It seems there is a greater story there,[sr]but I doubt it has anything to do with me.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
So, if you had chosen differently, you could have lived out your life peacefully, as one of the common folk.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Shakespeare
I would have thought that idea would hold great appeal for an empress, and yet you dismissed it out of hand!

I am happy enough as a Servant.[sr]I need not seek my happiness elsewhere.

[charaFace B 0]

＠Semiramis
I am sorry for bringing you along on this, Master.[sr]It seems this was a waste of time.
[k]

？1：I don't mind.
？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠Semiramis
Hehe, you are a simple one, aren't you.[sr]I will see that you receive some sort of reward.
[k]

＠Semiramis
Hmm, what should it be...[sr]No doubt you are tired of chocolate by now...

...These gardens will take considerable effort to complete. I am certainly not going to build them myself.
[k]

＠
Why did I go to such effort?[sr]Did I truly wish to win so badly?
[k]

＠
There are fragments with but the barest[sr]hint of memories throughout these gardens.
[k]

＠
Destruction... Victory... Loss...[sr]Encounters... Prayers... And...
[k]

＠
...No, I should not dwell on it. It would accomplish nothing except to make me feel bad.

These memories are mine, and yet not mine.[sr]I must not overstep my bounds.
