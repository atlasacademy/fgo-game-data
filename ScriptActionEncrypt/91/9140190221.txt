＠Martha
Haven't we enough trials to face?[sr]Just look at this world, isn't it obvious?
[k]

＠Martha
There's no place for anyone who can't see that, may that be men or demons. Back to hell with you!
[k]

＠Martha
No matter what era it is, there's no place for demons.

...Because all original sins[sr]were carried away by "Him."

A demon possessing the power equal to a dragon is scary, but, I think I am more afraid of St. Martha actually.

Really, I'm really glad[sr]she didn't go berserk...

＠Martha
Thanks to you, we've driven off the lost souls and the demon. All this too is God's will.
[k]

＠Martha
Yes, in normal circumstances, my existence as a Heroic Spirit is unnatural.
[k]

＠Martha
Even so... As long as I am with you, those who strive to save the world.
[k]

＠Martha
My momentary existence.[sr]My shallow resurrection.
[k]

＠Martha
...I believe all that has a purpose.[sr]Thank you. [%1], Mash Kyrielight.

＠Mash
No, St. Martha, thank you[sr]for lending us your assistance.
[k]

？1：Yes, thank you.

？2：We'll be counting on you.

？！

＠Martha
...Yes.
