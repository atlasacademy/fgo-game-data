＠Geronimo
Hm. A paved road.[sr]A faint foul odor.
[k]

＠Geronimo
No grass or earth. An ominous place covered with cold stones. I suppose even the fog that's been dirtied by science conceals magecraft.
[k]

＠Geronimo
So this is 19th century London.[sr]Truly distasteful. [charaFace A 1]But not bad, either.

I'm just saying it's not bad.[wt 0.2][sr]By the way,[charaFace A 4] Master, sorry to trouble you.
[k]

＠Geronimo
I'm sorry I was so selfish in asking you to come here.
[k]

？1：I don't mind. But why?
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Geronimo
It's the home of modern magecraft, correct?[sr]I never had a chance to cross the sea in my lifetime.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Our magecraft and their magecraft split apart completely in history.
[k]

＠Geronimo
On the other hand, there are many similarities as well. And let us set aside discussion of which is the original for the time being.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Geronimo
I've always wanted to take a look.[sr]Now, are there any rituals worthy of study...?

Hm. But first, spirits.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Geronimo
We often borrow the powers of spirits...but this is a low-class one.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Geronimo
It never occurred to me that we would encounter such a spirit the instant we set foot here, though.
[k]

＠Geronimo
I see London and death are quite...intimate in this time.

Fight? There is no reason not to just ignore something so weak...
[k]

＠Geronimo
Weak. Fragile. Fleeting.
[k]

＠Geronimo
It doesn't possess the strong emotions,[sr]grudges, or regrets normally so important to ghosts.
[k]

＠Geronimo
It likely died in a freak accident and something tied it to this place.
[k]

＠Geronimo
And then I expect it was awoken by the demonic fog that blanketed the city.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Geronimo
Besides, take a look at that insubstantial figure.[sr]It is practically advertising its weakness.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Honestly, it's not worth involving ourselves.[sr]It may be a ghost, but it is hardly important.

Oh. I see, I see. My apologies.[sr]I may have provoked them a bit.

Well, yes. I suppose.

＠Geronimo
To be honest, it'd be disingenuous of me to say I wasn't hoping for something like this.
[k]

＠Geronimo
I wanted to see what an English ghost would do if they got serious.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

？！

＠Geronimo
Either way, my apologies. I'd like you to accompany me in some, shall we say, ghost busting.
