Well, I fired three shots almost simultaneously at the same target, so we can call that a single shot, right?

Oh, I didn't intend to scare you.[sr]Sorry 'bout that.

How about we have a few drinks at that saloon? Oh, but bear in mind that if you drink booze made in this time, it'll probably taste like horse piss.
