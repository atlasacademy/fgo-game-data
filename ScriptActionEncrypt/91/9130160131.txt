Yeah, yeah. This old man pushed himself a bit too hard.[sr]My shoulders and back hurt all over.

＠Hektor
I think Durindana's got its sharpness back a little.[sr]Guess I'll call it good for now.
[k]

＠Hektor
Anyway, let's head back. [line 2]Oh, yeah.[sr]I guess I can be a bit more useful from now on?
[k]

？1：Of course.

？2：Please continue to lend us your strength.

？！

＠Hektor

...I'm not sure if this is the case,[sr]but maybe that ocean battle was on Hektor's mind?
[k]

＠Mash
To him it might be the distant past,[sr]but to us it's like yesterday.
[k]

＠Mash
So maybe he's trying to show[sr]he can be a good Servant...
[k]

？1：I trust him.

？！

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...I suppose you're right. That's what a Servant is, after all.
[k]

＠Mash
He is the one who answered our summons, so I'm[sr]sure that's a happy thing and not a troubling matter.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Let's continue to have him fight by our side.
