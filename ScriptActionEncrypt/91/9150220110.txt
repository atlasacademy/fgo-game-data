Ugh...sorry. I'm really sorry.[sr]But I'm relieved to hear you say that...

＠Sanzang
Sorrysorrysorry! I heard we were going[sr]to investigate a tiny Singularity...
[k]

＠Sanzang
So I thought this was going to be super easy even without Touta or Nitocris. But, well...um...
[k]

＠Sanzang
We wandered...and wandered some more... Next thing we know, we're waaay beyond where we're supposed to be...
[k]

＠Sanzang
And now we're camping out in the woods... I'm sorry.
[k]


＠Sanzang
Even though we have a clear destination, we took so many detours... Even I know that this is bad...
[k]

＠Sanzang
It's just, from the moment I start a journey,[sr]I can never take the straight path...
[k]

＠Sanzang
It's not always like that when I'm not alone.[sr]The normal me does have proper disciples, after all.
[k]

＠Sanzang
But when I'm alone, I just can't help myself...[sr]I am beyond hopeless...

C-camping out is wonder...ful.[sr]The stars are so pretty!

＠Sanzang
And now that we started a fire, all the bugs are out and attracted by it...it's like we're attracting attention because we're so popular!

And eating under the night sky is so nice![sr](Munch, munch...)

Oh, I have plenty of rice balls. It's a Sanzang rule to carry two days' worth of food on a one-day trip.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Now come on. Don't hold back. Eat up.[sr]I even have fresh water from that river over there!
[k]

＠Sanzang
Since we're in a lush forest, we were able to[sr]forage up plenty of nuts and mysterious fruits!
[k]

？1：Let's try a taste...
？2：Mysterious fruit may not be a good idea...

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanzang
Oh. Would you rather have fish or meat?[sr]Yeah...you're right...
[k]

＠Sanzang
...Ugh! I'm so sorry for being so inconsiderate.[sr]But since I'm a Buddhist monk, all killing is forbidden.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sanzang
Oh, but I won't stop you from hunting. I won't go in and stop other hunters from doing their thing, either.
[k]

？1：Rice balls and nuts are fine for tonight.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
You don't have to force yourself.[sr]But...thanks.

Ugh...I am beyond sorry...
[k]

＠Sanzang
It was because I kept powering forward.[sr]I know...I get it...it's totally my fault!
[k]

＠Sanzang
It's always been like this...Wukong, Bajie,[sr]and Wujing have all scolded me about this.
[k]

＠Sanzang
(Sigh) I just can't seem to break this habit.[sr]Maybe I can't get better because I'm not trying to fix it.
[k]

？1：Who knows?
？2：You definitely can't get better if you don't try!

？！

＠Sanzang
You're right. Absolutely right. Ungh.
[k]

＠Sanzang
We've lost communication with Chaldea,[sr]and I'm sure Mash is worried sick.
[k]

Yesterday, I forced you to walk so[sr]much that your legs got all sore.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Aaand yes, I forced you to stay outdoors[sr]overnight, with all those bugs around.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I apologize for that.[sr]I shouldn't mix exploration with training.

I don't want to cause trouble for Master.[sr]I don't want you to think of me as a stubborn teacher.
