Even though I have been reborn as a Heroic Spirit...
[k]


＠
No... Even though I have gained this shadow of my old form, the damage to my memories remains extensive.
[k]

＠
I am Danzo. Katou Danzo. A mechanical[sr]puppet ever on the verge of breaking down.
[k]

＠
If I had only materialized without all this damage,[sr]I might have been of better use to Master.
[k]

＠
As it stands now, my combat functionality[sr]should be more than adequate...
[k]

＠
Still, I cannot help but wonder how[sr]things might have gone differently.
[k]

＠
What if I had materialized without all this damage?
[k]

＠
What if I had arrived altogether blank,[sr]without archives full of fragmented data?
[k]

＠
But, then, for some reason...
[k]


＠
...whenever I start thinking things like that...
[k]

＠
...two conflicting thoughts flash through my head:
[k]

＠
...That I am fine just the way I am now...and that[sr]it is better I retain memories of my past...
[k]

＠
...Even if most of them remain out of reach.

There seems to be some manner of...bug in Danzo's central processor, localized within her database.

Well, it may not be a bug at all. It's even possible it's some sort of magecraft-based virus, for want of a better term.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But since this data shouldn't normally exist, it's safe to say it's responsible for these daydreams she's been having.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

Normally, we'd fight magecraft with magecraft to handle these sorts of Spirit Origin abnormalities...

While healing spells designed for human bodies won't suffice for this particular malady, we do have some other treatment options here at Chaldea.

We will sync her central processor with Chaldea's[sr]servers and run our strongest anti-malware program. [wt 0.5][charaFace D 4]By which I mean, um...

We've already got her synced up with Sheba,[sr]so all that's left is to send you in.
