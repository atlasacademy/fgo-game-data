I'm sorry that I'm the one greeting you today.[sr]Mash was on standby until the very last minute...

＠Serenity
But then a staff member came by and[sr]wanted to speak with her about Sheba.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Serenity
And so I have come to greet you instead.[sr]I'm sorry if I have disappointed you.
[k]

？1：Thanks for your greeting, Hassan.

[charaFace B 1]

Yes. Welcome back.

Will you be returning to My Room?[sr]Oh, but if you would like to eat...
[k]

＠Serenity
I've already notified the kitchen.[sr]Mr. Emiya, Miss Cat, Miss Boudica, and Miss Raikou...
[k]

＠Serenity
...are all surely anticipating your arrival.[sr]What would you like to do?
[k]

？1：Yeah, I am a little hungry.

＠Serenity
Understood. Strength that's been[sr]depleted must be restored.
[k]

＠Serenity
Then this way, please.[sr]I shall accompany you to the cafeteria.

...Um, I mean...I didn't mean to make it sound like that...
[k]

＠Serenity
I've recently come to reflect on my past actions... The fact that I would sneak into your bed without permission is, well...
[k]

＠Serenity
Miss Raikou told me that such a thing is...indecent.[sr]She was wearing a swimsuit when she told me...
[k]

＠Serenity
Of course, I always knew that to be the case in the back of my mind, and I always meant to behave appropriately, as I was raised...
[k]

＠Serenity
But I could not help myself, and that's why I... multiple times... Oh, yes...multiple times...
[k]


[charaFace B 4]

＠Serenity
I bothered you so many times...[sr]I will be careful from now on.
[k]

？1：You don't have to be so formal about it...
？2：All things in moderation. Moderation.
？！

[charaFace B 3]

＠Serenity
...But if you say that, I might...
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
[charaMoveReturn B 0,5 0.2]

No... No! Decency is important! We wouldn't want people sneaking into others' beds without permission!
[k]

＠Serenity
Moderation![sr]I will cultivate self-restraint!

Master.
[k]

＠Serenity
Chaldea is a strange place. I may not be in any position to say so because I've not traveled the world to learn much about various places...
[k]

＠Serenity
But that's how I feel... Many heroes from different times and parts of the world exist here together...
[k]

＠Serenity
Heroes of the past.[sr]Heroic Spirits. Servants.
[k]

＠Serenity
Dead beings, whose purpose isn't to[sr]live correctly in the present age...
[k]


？1：Um, well...
？2：Aren't they...incarnated temporarily?

？！

＠Serenity
No.
[k]

＠Serenity
Oh, I mean... Well, I'm not sure how to say this...[sr]I suppose that is one way to describe things.
[k]

＠Serenity
We retain our form using our Spirit Origins[sr]to stay in Chaldea, and we live like humans.
[k]

＠Serenity
I do not know the details of its system, but this is all thanks to the immense amount of magical energy that is supplied by Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Serenity
Perhaps a mage, even a Caster-class Servant...
[k]

＠Serenity
...would be able to better put into[sr]words what I am trying to describe...

But I can say this much: this body of mine[sr]is made possible through the power of ether.
[k]

＠Serenity
Blood courses through me, and I have a heart and[sr]brain. But at the same time, I have a Spirit Core.
[k]

＠Serenity
So unlike you, I am not a being with a proper body.
[k]

＠Serenity
A true incarnation...in other words, to gain existence as a complete living being would likely require the power of a wish-granting vessel like a Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Serenity
But...
[k]

＠Serenity
If I...could possibly...

Well, we're not really humans, but that's another story. There's no use lecturing you on that.

...In regards to the strange behavior[sr]of the Assassin, Hassan of the Serenity.
[k]

＠
Our first witness is Archer, Arash.
[k]

＠
It appears the two of them ran into each other in the hallway.
[k]

＠
Note that she was unable to properly respond to the sudden encounter, as she was focused only on Master.
[k]

＠
...and as a result, she made skin-to-skin contact with Arash.
[k]

＠
As you all know, the poisonous toxins that course through her body reach a wide range. They can even penetrate special garments made from magical energy.
[k]

＠
While not always fatal, a Servant touching her body will be affected by her poison.
[k]

＠
Paralysis and dizziness are common effects.
[k]

＠
Arash Kamangir, however, is highly resistant to poison.[sr]So, he seems to be fine even after this contact.
[k]

＠
But it was around that time when Hassan of[sr]the Serenity began to exhibit other strange behavior.
[k]

＠
Second witness: Mash Kyrielight.[sr]Third witness: Chaldea Staff J. Doe (name withheld).
[k]

＠
There are multiple witness reports of the subject standing in front of Master's My Room, doing nothing but bowing her head.
[k]

＠
And not just once or twice. Over the past few days, there have been at least five witnesses who have all given similar reports.
[k]

＠
She is clearly disturbed, which must be what is driving her behavior. She is obviously in psychological pain.
[k]

＠
...The reason is clear.
[k]

＠
She has finally come to realize that there are individuals other than Master to whom her touch is not fatal.
[k]

＠
It was just a matter of time.
[k]

＠
After contact with Arash, it appears she is[sr]trying to remain calm...at least around Master.
[k]

＠
But swift action must be taken, or there is a possibility that this could affect her and our activities in our Rayshifting missions.
[k]

＠
[sr][sr] 《This concludes the report by Paracelsus.》
