You're in a good mood as usual, Medea. I heard you settled a fight between the King of Heroes and the King of Conquerors.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Da Vinci
Stopping a serious fight between those two is not something an average Heroic Spirit can do.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
What's your secret to reconciliation?[sr]Curses don't work for them, I assume.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Medea Lily
Oh, they don't fight because they hate each other.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
They just want to throw their opinions at each other.[sr]So, I found an acceptable middle ground...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Medea Lily
...and offered pancakes to them at the end.[sr]Pancakes can be really handy at times.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
O-Oh, really? Were there cakes back in your era?
[k]

＠Medea Lily
I learned about them after I was summoned to the present age.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
I found something to get into other than magecraft, and people are really enjoying them. I am very happy.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
(I see. We can't go up against that. Even dragons would stop fighting when faced with such a happy aura of hers...)

Oh, but... I have recently come across a problem.[sr]The food stockpile in Chaldea is, well...

Oh, right. We have food for a year, but none can be used towards sweets.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
Medea, can't you do anything about it with your magecraft?
[k]

＠Medea Lily
Well, if I Rayshift somewhere, I can create as many ingredients as I want with alchemy...
[k]

＠Medea Lily
But when I return to Chaldea, I can only bring back whatever I can carry.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
Even going through the space-time gate, I can barely carry enough for [%1] and Mash.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
I'm afraid I can only bring back enough ingredients for one pancake. Oh![bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 0.4][charaFace B 0]

Yes! I just had a wonderful idea![sr]This is probably all thanks to the genius Da Vinci!
[k]

＠Medea Lily
If you can carry only one pancake, you just need to make that one pancake edible forever!
[k]

＠Medea Lily
Yes, how about we obtain the magical factor of a Demon God Pillar, an ingredient that regenerates even after countless destruction!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
Excuse me?

＠Medea Lily
Oh, I must tell [%1] right away![sr]We should go hunt a Demon God Pillar together!
