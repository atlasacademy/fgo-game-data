It's a black sail, Sir Tristan.
[k]

＠
Even as my eyes grew dim from poison,[sr]my hearing did not fail me.
[k]

＠
I heard a trembling voice,[sr]a whisper like one confessing their crimes.
[k]

＠
Regret, sorrow, hatred. And yet another[sr]pure emotion remained, untainted by them.
[k]

＠B：Tristan
Ah, I see. It was inevitable.
[k]

＠
I was truly very sorry.
[k]

＠
I must have hurt her so much...enough that it compelled her to say those words.
[k]

＠
Iseult. My Iseult with the white hands...the one who was by my side as I died.

As my wife, you were loyal even while I was not.[sr]And now the only thing I can do is believe.

＠
There was gratitude.[sr]There was compassion.
[k]

＠
There was atonement.[sr]Was there...ever love?
[k]

＠
My thoughts grow calmer. Is an inconstant man like me truly worthy and able to love such a good woman?
[k]

＠
No. I realized that at the moment of my death.
[k]

＠
That wild, passionate love I felt was the product[sr]of a love potion, not something within me.
[k]

＠
But I believed that was love. I believed it, and so continued to betray my Iseult of the white hands.
[k]

＠
I am truly a monster that does not know love.
[k]

＠
I was only ever loved by others,[sr]never able to love another myself.
