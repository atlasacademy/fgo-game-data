＠Tristan
They were not so tough.
[k]

＠Tristan
If that is the evil that dwells in my heart,[sr]it is...unimpressive.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Tristan
But I thought all would be resolved when we defeated those enemies...
[k]

？1：We're not waking up, though...
？！

＠Tristan
I'm terribly sorry.[sr]It's almost nightfall.
[k]

＠Tristan
How odd for night to come even in my dreams.
[k]

You must be tired.[sr]Let's find an inn so you can rest.

＠
But to be honest,[sr]I'm not sure where we are in the first place.
[k]

＠
We have no choice but to wander aimlessly. Aside from the beast we encountered, we haven't come across a single living being.
[k]

＠
Troubling.
[k]

＠
I asked Master whether a ritual of some sort was needed to wake us up, but [&he:she] did not have a definitive answer.
[k]

＠
Rather, [&he:she] asked if anything rang a bell to me.
[k]

＠
I was asked, so I thought.[sr]Something necessary to wake up...
[k]

＠
I thought of two options.[sr]First was suicide.
[k]

＠
In other words, if I slit my own throat, I would probably wake up. However, I doubt that was the answer to our troubles.
[k]

＠
If this was, by chance, an illusion established by the enemy, I would be a fool who abandoned my master.
[k]

＠
The second option: find my true enemy.
[k]

＠
It was hard to believe that that beast was the enemy who dwelled within my heart. There must be an entity...a source...that had given life to that beast.

Master. Let's get out of here immediately.[sr]This city is dangerous.

？！

You are right in thinking this place is deserted,[sr]but that is precisely why it is so dangerous.

It is surprising how much can be learned from the sound of breathing alone.
[k]

＠
It can tell us whether someone is calm, angry, or sad...whether they are lying, happy, or even waiting for a chance to strike and kill.
[k]

But the breath that you, Master, just drew when you spoke, was not that of a human being.
