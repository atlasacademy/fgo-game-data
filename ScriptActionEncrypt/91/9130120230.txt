Oh, there you are. Why are you just standing[sr]in the corner like that? It's very strange.

In any case, Brynhild, I am sorry it took so long, but Santa Claus has finally come to town.

Not to worry. Whatever is wrong with[sr]your Spirit Origin, I'll fix it.

Ho ho ho. I may once have been known as[sr]the Whip of God...but today is different!

Today, as I am even Santa Claus off-season,[sr]I'm here to smack you with the Whip of Love.

Oops, scratch that. I mean whap you with my cane.[sr]Just a little bonk on the head; nothing to worry about.

＠Altera Santa
Once I smack you with my cane, there'll be some stars, and you'll feel better right away.

Don't worry. She and I have much in common,[sr]so I know how she feels.

＠Altera Santa
She looks like a delicate flower,[sr]but she's actually very tough at heart.

[charaFace C 2]
＠Altera Santa
Since she's focused her skills and stats on combat, she should eventually remember her true Spirit Origin if we fight her in earnest!

？1：I think I maybe possibly kind of don't get it!?

[charaFace C 9]
＠Altera Santa
That's okay.[sr]I'm not completely sure either!

Don't worry.[sr]I have no plans of destroying her!
