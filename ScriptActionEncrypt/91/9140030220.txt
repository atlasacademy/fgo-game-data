＠Nikola Tesla
Indeed, I am feeling quite ill.[sr]I never imagined I would be prone to seasickness.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
I shall have to think about ways to stabilize a ship's deck prior to my next voyage.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Nikola Tesla
No, wait. Perhaps I should invent a way for[sr]boats to glide across the water's surface.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
If I were to lay down electromagnetic rails in the air, so that it float across them like a hovercraft...
[k]

[charaFace C 3]

＠Nikola Tesla
No, wait. That would just[sr]be a hovertrain, not a boat...
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
Hmm. Even with my wisdom guiding the myths of humanity, it seems the sea is still the domain of the old gods...

Even in modern times, most ships use diesel engines.

Though the number of electric and hybrid cars is growing, ocean travel is still pretty unstable.

That would change if there were a more efficient[sr]way of generating electricity via combustion.

Unfortunately, the only attempt at perpetual motion to ever succeed that I am aware of is the special Tesla coil I wear.

Speaking as a sailor, bringing electricity on board is all risk and no reward. I wish you'd just get off the ship before you end up burning the mast down.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Blackbeard
Not that any ship of mine or the old hag couldn't handle a little lightning strike, of course!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Blackbeard
Anyway, is this Cape Horn place where you hid your legendary treasure or something?
[k]

＠Blackbeard
Say, all those gold doubloons you stole from the Spanish that nobody ever found...?

You just can't stop being creepy, can you...[sr]Must've taken you a good while to figure that...
[k]

？1：...Huh?
？2：Then, this really IS a treasure hunt!?
？！

[charaFace B 3]

＠Drake
N-nah, nothing so grandiose.[sr]I just happened to remember something is all.
[k]

＠Drake
Back then, I found a buncha jewels and talismans I didn't know what to make of, and I thought you might have a use for them.

Right? I know Chaldea's always just barely making ends meet, so I'm hoping this stuff can help out, even just a little.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Drake
But don't get your hopes up too high.[sr]We're basically just going back for something I forgot.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

There's just one little problem.[sr]We're probably gonna run into you-know-what.

That's the one. But this probably won't be as bad as back then. Especially since you can shoot it.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Drake
But on the flip side, this one's even more dangerous.
[k]

＠Drake
Me, [%1], and Mash alone[sr]won't be able to handle it.
[k]

＠Drake
That's why I had Tesla here come along![sr]So he can help us fight storm with storm.

(No, they're too lacking in substance for that. They're more like shadows than anything... Maybe they're shadows cast by Drake herself...?)
