Now I see.[sr]I'm sorry for the trouble my real self caused you.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Passionlip
I'm the Lip from her mind's second Secret Garden,[sr]so I don't know how much use I can be...
[k]

＠Passionlip
...but I'll do the best I can to help[sr]you get back out, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Passionlip
Although... (Sigh)[sr]I don't see why Mothe[line 2]BB is here too.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Passionlip
And why is she even acting like my mother now, anyway? She can buzz off for all I care.
[k]

＠Passionlip
Stupid insensitive BB. Stupid nosy nurse, always doing more harm than good. She's just a cruel AI who doesn't know the difference between caring and controlling.
[k]

＠Passionlip
Even when she realizes her charge hates her “treatment,” she can't stop herself.
[k]

＠Passionlip
Can you imagine getting so swept up in your own desires you lose sight of everything else? It's pathetic.
[k]

＠Passionlip
She loves to call me dense, but what am I supposed to do about it? If I am dense, the only possible explanation for it is that I got it from her!
[k]

＠Passionlip
If she wants me to wise up, then she'd better start by fixing her own issues first.
[k]

＠Passionlip
Of course, we all know she'll just bug out the more she tries to fix herself. She never was very smart.
[k]


？1：I've never heard you be so aggressive before...!
？2：(...I see. So this is the SG2 version...)

...Much as it pains me to say it, given how she's one of my own Alter Egos, this is Passionlip's true nature.[sr]Or at least, one side of it.
[k]

＠BB
Masochistic Nature might be a pretty horrid skill that makes you an object of derision just for existing, but it's not like there's no reason at all for it.
[k]

＠BB
The person at the center of it is still at least partially responsible.

[k]

＠Passionlip
I've stopped depending so much on others, I'm doing more things for myself... I'm learning and growing every day!
[k]

＠Passionlip
Right, [%1]!?[sr]I have grown, haven't I!?
[k]

？1：You sure have. (Maintaining eye contact)
？2：You sure have. (Looking downward)

？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Passionlip
See!? I'm not the same old Lip who[sr]got bullied just for existing anymore!
[k]

＠Passionlip
I've mentally grown up a whole bunch! In fact, I'll say it right now: I'm officially leaving my Masochistic Nature behind forever!

＠BB
No wonder she hasn't been feeling right. Our SGs may contain secrets and weaknesses, but they're not flaws...
[k]

＠BB
Not to mention she evidently doesn't even understand that personalities don't change on a dime.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠BB
Still, I'm sure it won't be long before reality slaps her back down. For now, I see our next obstacle.
[k]

＠BB
From here on, you and Lip can do all the fighting.
[k]

＠BB
How far will Lip and her good girl act take you?[sr]I look forward to finding out from my director's chair!

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Passionlip
O-oh, uh, in the Sakura Labyrinth, Reliefs are the world's edges that block off the exits.

Uh, they're kind of like...the girl who's acting as the labyrinth's core is engraved into its walls at the same time...?

[k]

＠Medb
Well, now I'm just too pissed to give up. You didn't let her get away 'cause you felt bad for her or anything like that, did you?

I agree that letting that Servant run free will do Chaldea no favors. She must be dealt with.

It does go against my own beliefs to gang up on an opponent...but I am willing to bend the rules in this case. Let us all go after her.

For that matter, I think the three of us makes for a rather fair fight. Wouldn't you agree, Para?

When she said those things to me, I understood what it meant to put on airs. I will not be satisfied until she has been duly punished.
