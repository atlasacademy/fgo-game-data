I surrender, Master. I've learned my lesson.

＠Arthur
Besides, I did think that if many Heroic Spirits, or even just you yourself, were to confront me about this...

＠Arthur
...I would need to reconsider[sr]my approach to staying here.

＠Arthur
I was hoping to stay out of sight,[sr]but I never wished to cause any trouble.

Thank you again for having me here, [%1].
