＠Caesar
Well, drat. Perhaps I let the prospect of spending time in secret with the beautiful queen get the better of me.
[k]

＠Caesar
I spent so much time on my alibi to allay Cleopatra's suspicions that I neglected to rig the actual invitation.
[k]

＠Caesar
It seems I cast my die prematurely after all...

＠Columbus
Oh, right, I almost forgot. I wasn't completely truthful earlier, so let me set the record straight.
[k]

＠Columbus
Sure, I made my way west 'cause I thought it'd make me rich, but that wasn't the only reason.
[k]

＠Columbus
...And I gotta admit,[sr]it feels a little weird telling you this...

(Sigh). All right...what was the other reason?

＠D：[servantName 503400:Fluffy-Eared Caster:Queen of Sheba]
Well...that certainly doesn't[sr]sound very merchant-like...
[k]

＠D：[servantName 503400:Fluffy-Eared Caster:Queen of Sheba]
But then again, maybe in one sense,[sr]it very much is...
[k]

[charaFace D 6]

＠D：[servantName 503400:Fluffy-Eared Caster:Queen of Sheba]
Hmm. I honestly can't tell which...

＠Columbus
All right, only one more to go.
[k]

＠Columbus
Truth be told, this last club's the only one[sr]where I've got no idea why they invited me.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Columbus
I'll do my best to convince them peacefully...but if that falls through, I'll be counting on you to help bail me out again, Master.
[k]

＠Columbus
But don't worry. For this next club in particular, I'm pretty sure words will be just fine, and things shouldn't likely turn violent.
[k]

＠Columbus
Hell, these next Servants have so little connection to me that I wouldn't be surprised if you ended up turning them down for me.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Columbus
...Honestly, I wonder if this invite[sr]wasn't just some kind of mistake.
