＠Mash
The battle is over...[sr]You know...I'm three times more...tired than usual...
[k]

？1：Good job, Mash.

？2：...It was a disaster, huh?

？！

I'm relieved that you and Fou...both made it...

＠Mash
Those wild beasts had their eyes on the two of you, I was doing everything I can...
[k]

Fou!?

＠El-Melloi
You're done?[sr]So how did I do, [%1]? Did I pass?
[k]

？1：You've convinced me.

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
That's good.[sr]I'm finished assessing you too.
[k]

？2：That's not fair, you can fight as a human.

[charaFace D 4]
＠El-Melloi
Not fair? Oh I see, you mean comparing to you? So you're jealous that I can fight on the front line despite being a human.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Cherish what you're feeling now. Because it requires[sr]strength to withstand that feeling of powerlessness.
[k]

？！

＠El-Melloi
As you can see, I can fight as a Servant.[sr]You might be unsatisfied with my firepower, but I will make up with my intellect.

＠Dr. Roman
Oh. He's definitely a first-rate Servant. I mean all[sr]Pseudo-Servants are exceptional cases to begin with.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[%1], eventually you'll be able to meet[sr]a Pseudo-Servant who fused with a god, I think.

＠El-Melloi
Probably...Well, I am a special case.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Most vessels chosen to become Pseudo-Servants...[sr]in other words, mages, already possess powers.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
And when Heroic Spirits possess humans, they will choose those who closely resemble themselves. So of course they are powerful.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Those integrated will then transmigrate into a third personality, a new personality if you will.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠El-Melloi
Those kinds of Servants are troublesome.[sr]After all, they tend to think like Divine Spirits.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
They will probably be completely selfish[sr]and ask for all kinds of impossible things.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Then you'll know that I'm one of the better ones.

＠Dr. Roman
Hahaha...Well, let's save that for the future.[sr]Good job, Mash, [%1].
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Come home with Mr. El-Melloi II.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I couldn't fight with you, but I can welcome you home with a warm cup of tea.
