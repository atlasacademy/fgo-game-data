No...I'll chase him round perdition's flames before I give him up. I shall show them what it is to be Lord Impaler.

Pathetic. Only through luck and coincidence did he succeed in his summoning. Without the ability to control his thrall, there is no point summoning it.
[k]

＠Vlad III
Fine.[sr]O[charaFace A 2] almighty Phantasmal Beast... Dragonkin!
[k]

＠Vlad III
My father revered thy name, and deemed thy form perfect for battle!
[k]

＠Vlad III
And as his son, I have been despised by my enemies, by the people, by history itself... Not as a dragon, but as the devil!
[k]

＠Vlad III
And now, I shall grapple with thee...a being Father deemed perfection itself. What irony!
[k]

＠Vlad III
But I am grateful for this evil fortune! It may be twisted, but I will make a most worthy opponent for you!

＠Vlad III
I, Vlad III, the son of Dracul...shall sink my fangs into your neck!
