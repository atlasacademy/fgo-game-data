What's with this place!?[sr]It's all traps and guards... No treasure anywhere!

Not possible! Do you think I spend my days just aimlessly bombing things all the time!?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Ishtar
Absolutely not![sr]Thorough intel gathering is the first step to victory!
[k]

＠Ishtar
Gilgamesh could never fool me with a fake treasury!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Ishtar
I tested the durability of each treasury to find the real one, and even made sure to perfectly conceal my efforts by destroying the evidence every time!
[k]

＠Ishtar
The most durable treasury would surely be the true treasury! Don't you think?

Ah...maybe. It makes sense to protect the real treasury the most thoroughly. That's the whole point of security.

Right!? That's why I was sure this one was the right one, and I've been spending my days and nights examining its structure in flyovers!
[k]

＠Ishtar
You know how I make a copy of Venus with[sr]my Noble Phantasm? Essentially the same idea.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Ishtar
I've so thoroughly memorized the layout, it's as if it's been etched onto my Spirit Origin. I can walk through this place with my eyes closed!

What spectacular dedication and diligence.[sr]I expect nothing less from you, Ishtar.

But even after all your efforts, you're still falling into every trap here... What does that mean?

Eh...? W-well, they may be detailed copies, but they're all miniatures that can fit in my palm.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I couldn't confirm all the internal structures...or copying the complicated structures and gimmicks...
[k]

＠Ishtar
B-but, it should be enough if I can remember all the paths, right? Besides, it's such a pain to memorize the location of all the traps.

In other words...

Exactly.

If one can predict how the sneaky rodent behaves,[sr]then one knows exactly where to place the traps.

Fool! I would never allow my death to be disturbed by something so trivial!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
But alarms kept ringing all through the underworld because YOU kept getting caught in my traps, and I couldn't stay dead even if I wanted to!
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Gilgamesh
And the Queen of Kur kept nagging at me, demanding[sr]I either go stop the alarm, or wring the neck of the idiot who keeps on triggering the alarm.
[k]

I had no idea what you were talking about at first...but ah, yes. That. Heh...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Gilgamesh
How terribly unfortunate for you, Ishtar. You see, that agreement just reached its statute of limitations a mere day ago.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Come, take a good look at the contract. Do you see this engraving here at the bottom left of the back side of the tablet that's only visible when you shine the sun's light directly onto it?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
“...However, in the event of Gilgamesh's death, or if no payment is made within fifteen days, this agreement shall be null and void.”
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Ah, how unfortunate. Truly unfortunate! Good for Siduri! That was marvelous advice on her part!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Who could have foreseen a goddess like Ishtar making such a foolish mistake!

Besides, there's no such thing as a statute of limitation in an agreement made with a goddess!

If that's how it is, then I'm gonna drag you out of the underworld, revive you, and THEN KILL YOU AGAIN!

And THEN make you pay up!

You...really want to repeat your trip to the underworld yet again? Even I'm impressed with how much of a mess you're willing to make for your own selfish desires.

[charaFace C 2]

That spirit of yours is the only thing worth praising! But since you're a grown-up, you should also be aware of how much of a pain you are!
