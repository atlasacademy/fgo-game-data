＠Medea Lily
Let me introduce myself once again, Master. I'm Medea, and my class is Caster.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
I have been devoted to practicing magecraft as head priestess of a shrine under Hecate, Goddess of the moon.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Medea Lily
So, you can relax when I'm around, and treat me like a housekeeper who can use magic.

Well, actually, while I was “praying” for everyone's health, I detected a terrible aura on this island.

It'd be catastrophic if left unchecked... No, even worse, I can't bear to watch a crack form in their friendship...
