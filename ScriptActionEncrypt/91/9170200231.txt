All I know is that we were made to wait here, peacefully, until you two arrived.

We were then ordered to kill you. Nothing more.

This can only mean one of two things.[sr]Whoever summoned us hates either Chaldea, or you.

Once we got cut off from voice comms, the only[sr]thing we could do was track your vital signs...

Though at least they remained stable the whole time. Everything okay on your end?

Oho, sounds like we're in for a good story.

All right, since it looks like you're all done cleaning up there, we'll get ready to bring you back.

Just let us know when you're done.
