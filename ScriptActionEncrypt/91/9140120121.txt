I would like you to get him out of the pyramid!
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Nitocris
The great compound shrine that's been reproduced by the simulator is simply based on his memories...but it is still nothing but a counterfeit.
[k]

＠Nitocris
It cannot be good for even him[sr]to stay cooped up in there.
[k]

＠Nitocris
I would like him to walk around Chaldea, and perhaps interact with some of the other Servants...
[k]

＠Nitocris
I...I...would like him to continue thriving.
[k]

？1：Got it. Let's do it!

[charaFace B 6]

＠Nitocris
Thank you![sr]I knew you would agree!
[k]

＠Nitocris
As unworthy as I am, I will aid you as best I can![sr]Let us accomplish this task, no matter what!
[k]

＠Nitocris
So please...even just for a little while,[sr]let's take him outside!

Nitocris! Where's Nitocris!?

＠Ozymandias
I suppose I don't even have to ask where you are, since you're always beside me. Well then, let us head to the recreation room together!
