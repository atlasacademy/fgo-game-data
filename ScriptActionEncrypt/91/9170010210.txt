Is this...a labyrinth?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yep, Fuyuki's underground labyrinth... Where the Massive Cavern located. I'm picking up an odd response at the far end of the labyrinth.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
It's either remnants of the Singularity, or a dimensional[sr]disturbance. Either way, we can't just ignore it.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
We have to eradicate it while its roots are still small.[sr]Let's get going right away, Senpai.

Not only there's no singularity here, there's nothing here[sr]period. And the way to the exit is packed with enemies.

＠Dr. Roman
And it looks like you're being trapped inside a magical dimension, keeping the communication up is the best I can do, let along interfering.
