＠
...All sorts of Servants have started visiting my room.
[k]

＠
I know it's probably a good thing.
[k]

＠
I used to be sad and mopey all the time.[sr]Now I think I'm leading a fuller life.
[k]

＠
Every day here is great. The work, the training, the small talk... It's all so refreshingly straightforward.
[k]

＠
I have old friends here I can be myself[sr]around, and I've made new ones, too.
[k]

＠
If someone asked whether or not I liked this,[sr]my honest answer would be that I do.
[k]

＠
But every time I come to that conclusion, I can feel the gears in my heart creaking against the strain.
[k]


＠
No, no, no.[sr]This isn't who you are.
[k]

＠
That's when I start to feel bad again. Not at how wrongly I'm behaving, but at how right.
[k]

＠
...I want to be left alone.
[k]


＠
It's just as hard now as it was before. Being around people is tiring, all the smiling gives me a cramp, I can't get any work done on my book...
[k]

＠
But at the same time, I can't pretend to be a proud lone wolf. I still get lonely.
[k]

＠
Unlike a certain king I could name, I can't really say I'm okay just being all by myself.
[k]

＠
It sucks. My feelings are all over the place, and I can't put them into words in any kind of way that makes sense.
[k]


＠
I half-ass everything... I can never choose a side...[sr]I'm a bat, a snake, a castle monster...
[k]

＠
...I don't know WHAT I am.
[k]

...Is something wrong, Master?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Kiyohime
You looked as though you were dreaming even while you were walking.
[k]

？1：Sorry, I guess I spaced out.

[charaFace A 11]

＠Kiyohime
Hmph. I can't believe you'd space[sr]out when you're here with me!
[k]

？2：I think...I just saw one of Osakabehime's dreams...

[charaFace A 4]


＠Kiyohime
Well, this is Batty[line 2]Osakabehime's domain. It's no surprise something like that could happen here.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Kiyohime
It's nothing as strong as a Reality Marble, of course. It's just a big papier-mâché delusion stretched as far as it'll go.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
I could burn it all now and this would be over in an instant, but Batty really would shut herself away if I did that.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
So I'm afraid I'll need you to join me for[sr]at least a little while longer, Master.
[k]

？！
