＠
It was just another job.
[k]

＠
To them, it was just another minute Singularity. To me, it was a threat to be eliminated as a Counter Guardian.
[k]

＠
There's no need to go into details.[sr]A target emerged, and needed to be taken care of.
[k]

＠
I simply do what I was meant to do:[sr]I search for the enemy, engage, and eliminate them.
[k]

＠
The fewer people I engage with, the better.[sr]At least, that's a personal choice of mine.
[k]

＠
Heroic Spirits. Heroes.[sr]Many of those are mere shadows of mass murderers.
[k]

＠
In my opinion, they are all repulsive.[sr]I prefer not to be by their side when fighting.
[k]

＠
But working completely independently is also difficult.
[k]

＠
It must be because of my lack of freedom as a Servant.
[k]

＠
Requiring Master to accompany us for Rayshifts is a pain. But I suppose that has turned out to be a blessing in disguise...
[k]

＠
[%1], or Master, is quick to understand. And so we were progressing smoothly. This time is no different.
[k]

＠
The source of the minute Singularity... It could be a fragment of a Holy Grail, or a remnant of the original abnormality in the timeline.
[k]

＠
But they are all simple to track. A majority of them can be eradicated and handled with a single attack.
[k]

＠
Should it be a life-form, we kill it.[sr]If it is an inanimate object, we destroy it.
[k]

＠
We seek it out, and then swiftly...

...This time around, it's quite clear-cut.
[k]

＠Emiya
It must be a remnant of the many things you defeated. It's not as powerful as what we encountered in the final Singularity.
[k]

＠Emiya
It's not alive.[sr]It's already dead.
[k]

＠Emiya
But it's taken in a shard of a Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Emiya
Which then it turned into a minute Singularity.[sr]What a pain. There are far too many Holy Grails...
[k]

＠Emiya
...and, of course, shards in this Grand Order.
[k]

？1：Sorry to take up your time, Emiya.

＠Emiya
Likewise.[sr]Sorry to rope you into this.
[k]


？2：Thanks for finding it so quickly.

＠Emiya
Finding the problem and dealing with it swiftly[sr]is my forte. I should be the one thanking you.
