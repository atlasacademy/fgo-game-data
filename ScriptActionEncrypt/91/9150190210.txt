(Senpai, Mr. El-Melloi seems off.[sr]I know he looks irritable all the time, but now...)
[k]

？1：Is he looking at the sea?

？2：He's looking at the sunset?

？！

Fou, fou.

＠El-Melloi
Ma'am. If you're going to hide, at least put down your[sr]shield. Anyone will notice a black steel wall on the beach.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
You too [%1].[sr]As her Master you should've pointed that out.

＠El-Melloi
Nothing, I was just looking at the sea.[sr]I heard it was named Okeanos due to the Grail.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
But it's just a name. It's a horizon as far as you[sr]can see, but the edges simply adhere to each other.
[k]

[seStop ad37]
＠El-Melloi
Just like a scroll. A sea enclosed in all directions[sr]that perpetually revolves around the same area.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
You can sail it endlessly, but in truth,[sr]it's just a clipped miniature garden. How absurd.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠El-Melloi
This is not the place I set out to reach.[sr]Not even close to the real Okeanos.

＠Mash
You wanted to reach Okeanos?[sr]Are those the words of Zhuge Liang?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠El-Melloi
...Hmph, those are my words. Watch your mouth.[sr]It appears I got too sentimental.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
It was a dream. One that I had when I was younger.[sr]All the experience I've gained was to further that goal.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
I didn't become what I am now naturally.[sr]I was an average mage.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Taking on that troublesome teaching position, inheriting the name of El-Melloi, refining my third-rate magical circuit, it's all because[line 3]
[k]

＠El-Melloi
I wanted to become the ideal I yearned for when I was[sr]young. Now, I'm just a crooked old mage.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
A crooked mage...you?[sr]Even though you are a first-class mage?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
Only my position is first-class. My ability as a mage[sr]isn't much different from [%1].
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
I somehow managed to keep up with those first-class monsters with my knowledge and preparations.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Dr. Roman can see through that too. Whatever you[sr]say about that guy, he's a natural at talent assessment.
[k]

？1：...You didn't reach your ideal?

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
Stop with your nonsense. I did reach it.[sr]That's why I'm like this, right?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
I reached my ideal, just not the natural way.[sr]It's a bit harder every day, and it's killing my stomach.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
You need to remember, [%1]. With[sr]strong convictions and desires, you can reach your ideal.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
It's a rough path for an ordinary person. You'll reach[sr]your ideal but lose your way of life in the process.
[k]

？2：...You couldn't reach Okeanos?

[charaFace D 4]
＠El-Melloi
Well, I haven't started the journey yet.[sr]I'm just not ready to reach the endless sea.
[k]
