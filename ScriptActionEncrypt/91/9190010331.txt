Welp, looks like we lost...

But then again, I suppose there was only so far I could go as a jester. What a shame. Maybe we should invite someone more fun to join our little party.

＠Mephistopheles (Enemy)
Then again, maybe the Counter Force went[sr]easy on us, pitting me against you?

Not at all. If anything, I think it was a dreadfully cold-blooded decision. This Lord guy seems like a real sadist, if you ask me.
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
After all, if I hadn't been here,[sr]that woman you're with would never admit defeat.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Mephistopheles
The fact that you and I are equally matched means that she has only herself to blame if she loses.

It may not have looked like it, but I really was doing my best out there, you know?

I didn't defeat you alone.[sr]We did it together.
[k]

＠Jeanne
...Yes, I did end up creating you.[sr]But I didn't regret that at all.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Jeanne
Instead...I was happy. Happy to know I was actually the sort of person who wanted to live on more than anything.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Happy to know I was the sort of ordinary person who felt joy at seeing others come to her rescue.
[k]

＠Jeanne
So I was genuinely happy to see that Master didn't think twice about saving me.
[k]

＠Jeanne
I didn't fight as a Holy Maiden. I fought you as just another Servant, and I won. That's all there is to it.
[k]

＠Jeanne
That isn't about faith,[sr]however weak or strong it might be.

You're another side of my Heroic Spirit. You could end up getting registered as an Anti-Heroic Spirit.

Who knows? Maybe there will come a time when your power will be exactly what is necessary to save the day.

...Is that supposed to be a joke? I'd rather disappear forever than get dragged into something like that.

＠Jeanne Alter
But if I have no choice,[sr]I hope I can at least change my class first.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I'm not cut out to be a Ruler.

...And that brings my story to a close.[sr]Master...thank you for everything. Sincerely.
[k]

？1：You know, thinking back on it now...
？2：I kind of get the impression this was all my fault...
？！

＠Jeanne
Yes, it may well be.
[k]

＠Jeanne
But isn't that how it is with friends and allies?[sr]I know I've made plenty of trouble for you.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Besides...it's like I said earlier.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Jeanne
This made me really happy.
[k]

＠Jeanne
I was so happy I got to see you running in to save me.

No other reward could possibly compare to that.
[k]

＠Jeanne
That goes for you too, Mephistopheles.[sr]I was so happy that you came to save me.

Reeeally? I'm not used to this sort of thing,[sr]so I'm not quite sure how to respond to that.

＠Mephistopheles
But, as long as you enjoyed yourself, that's all that matters. Even better if it made you smile!

＠Mephistopheles
Ahh, it really is fun being a Servant.

[charaFace C 2]

This little adventure truly was like a dream come true, so to speak! Well, see you later!

Haha, whatever you might be, devil or otherwise...there's nothing more beautiful, or more fun, than joining forces and fighting together.

All right, Master, what do you[sr]say we awaken from this dream?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Jeanne
Your journey to protect humanity[sr]is still far from over, after all...

...And so ends one of the stories of Jeanne d'Arc.
[k]

＠
Jeanne would go on to experience many things, and eventually, an Avenger of her would be born as well...
[k]

But that...is a story for another time.
