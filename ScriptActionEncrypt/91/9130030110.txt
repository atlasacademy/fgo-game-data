＠Vlad III
What's wrong?[sr]Can't sleep, my friend?
[k]

＠Vlad III
Leave the night watch to me.[sr]Humans require sleep. Rest up for tomorrow.
[k]

＠Vlad III
Hm? You want to hear the story of me before I became a Heroic Spirit? You are a peculiar contractor. I must ask your forgiveness.
[k]

＠Vlad III
There are no stories of THIS me worth telling.[sr]Nor do I have any feats to boast of.
[k]

＠Vlad III
I donned this armor to purge tyranny from the land...making me no different than those who had fallen.
[k]

＠Vlad III
The Vlad III who was the lord of the land is no more.[sr]I stand here before you as a general, a warrior.
[k]

＠Vlad III
The only reason why I contracted with you as a Heroic Spirit was because I sensed the presence of evil.
[k]

＠Vlad III
You fight for justice, and the Lord allowed me to wield[sr]my lance so long as it was under your command.
[k]

＠Vlad III
I have neither principles nor ideals. I am simply a machine, impaling your enemies. What stories could such a thing possibly have to tell?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Vlad III
Actually, now that I think about it,[sr]perhaps I do have a reason...
[k]

＠Vlad III
Maybe it is just the dying flames of our fire here,[sr]but a peculiar vision comes to mind...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Vlad III
Unlike the other Heroic Spirits, I've no need for a second wish. I do not even know why I fight so fiercely after my death.
[k]

＠Vlad III
I lost sight of God's love. I may have believed it was real, but I had forsaken the love that I actually received. Twice.
[k]

＠Vlad III
First was the goodness of the citizens...the virtuous spirit given by the nobility. And second was my other loving half who fell from the tower...
[k]

＠Vlad III
I do not doubt God's love, but I never believed I would witness it ever again.
[k]

＠Vlad III
But...I had a dream.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Vlad III
Hahaha. Even Servants can dream. Our dreams, though, are no more than our way of reliving what happened in our lives.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Vlad III
Yet mine was different. Unbelievable as it may sound, my dream was not about my past.
[k]

＠Vlad III
It was a dream about a woman...a woman who was thinly frail, sickly at heart, who truly stood at death's door.
[k]


＠Vlad III
The woman had lost her beloved child. Stillbirth.[sr]The experience likely shattered her heart and mind.
[k]

＠Vlad III
In despair, she refused to eat. In a cruel twist of fate, she found she could only consume those whom she truly loved.
[k]

＠Vlad III
Of course, the woman was exiled from her homeland,[sr]a fate she accepted, becoming an outcast.
[k]


＠Vlad III
Humans who do not eat, without exception,[sr]fail to survive.
[k]

＠Vlad III
She might have been able to convince herself that it is the natural order of things for one life to take another for sustenance.
[k]


＠Vlad III
However, she did not once consume her loved ones,[sr]even to the day of her death.
[k]

＠Vlad III
She chose the lives of others over her own. She managed to avoid terrorizing her loved ones until the end.
[k]


＠Vlad III
This may sound strange to say aloud, but I believe that, through that woman, I caught just a glimpse of the love I'd lost.
[k]


＠Vlad III
Just knowing such a woman exists...[sr]I would gladly burn in the fires of hell once more.
[k]

What horrendous ghosts! Even after death,[sr]they attempt to murder and consume the living!
[k]

＠Vlad III
In life, they attacked others for their own gain, and in death their loathing of the living is born of their own suffering!
[k]

＠Vlad III
Sinners who left your own prayers behind and for whom no one prays for anymore! I do not ask for your repentance! You will be no more than prey for my spear!
