Hey! [%1]!

＠Ishtar
Why're you taking Enkidu's side here!?
[k]

？1：You struck first...

[charaFace E 14]
＠Ishtar
Ugh... Okay, MAYBE that's true, but this is Enkidu![sr]Isn't humanity all about preemptive strikes?

Stop! I strongly urge you not to do that! I'm sure[sr]it'll get SUPER complicated in A LOT of ways!

？2：Couldn't help it after seeing the Demonic Statue's design...

[charaFace E 9]
＠Ishtar
Wouldn't that be more reason for you not to attack it!? What are you, a hornet that attacks anything that's a color you don't like?

I'll have you know that they were supposed to be guardian statues of justice that received the blessing of a goddess...me!

Right. The moment I tried to inflict the final blow,[sr]I felt as if Master were about to cast Gandr on me.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Enkidu
Master, trusting Ishtar is your choice, but I recommend extreme caution in dealing with such a wild, capricious goddess as her.
[k]

＠Enkidu
She may say that all she does is for humans, but her entire thought process is fundamentally different to begin with. What's worse, she is unaware of this.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Enkidu
Just think of her as one of those bizarre sorts who turn up at the change of seasons...someone with delusions of managing the world.

No, I have no intention of continuing.[sr]And I apologize for my many indiscretions.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Enkidu
This apology is not for Ishtar, but for the poor human whom she has merged with. I should respect that girl at least, whoever she is and wherever she may be from.
[k]

＠Enkidu
She may be somewhat like Ishtar, but the fact remains that she has managed to mellow Ishtar out somewhat, which can only mean she has a most virtuous soul.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Or maybe strong-willed is a better word for it.[sr]The goddess has retained a tendency to rush into things without considering the consequences.

Ungh...this piece of junk still loves making those cutting remarks. Are you okay with that, [%1]? Does it stress you out?

？！

(Sigh) Suppose this junkpile is[sr]still good at playing innocent.
