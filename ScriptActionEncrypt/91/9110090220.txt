...I've lost count of how many people I've cut down.
[k]

＠
...I never even tried to keep[sr]track of all the people I killed.
[k]

＠
All I know is that I just kept killing,[sr]one after the other.
[k]

＠
It's not like I hate these soldiers. I don't have any kind of personal grudge or anything.
[k]

＠
But since they're a part of King Arthur's army,[sr]that makes them part of King Arthur himself.
[k]

＠
So I have to kill them.
[k]

＠
Every single one of them.
[k]

＠
How do you like that, O great King Arthur?
[k]

＠
Your kingdom is done for![sr]Your legend is over!
[k]

＠
And all because of me![sr]I'm the one who ended them!
[k]

＠
Do you hate me?[sr]Do you despise me!?
[k]

＠
Then go on. Hate me! Rage at me![sr]Treat me like an enemy! Try and kill me!
[k]

＠
Despise me![sr]Loathe me!
[k]

＠
Just...
[k]

＠
...LOOK at me, Father...!
