...Whew. It was a long journey, but we have managed to retrieve half of the stolen materials.
[k]

＠Gawain
And yet, in a way, each and every person we encountered was a victim. Had I gone all-out, I would have brought many people to financial ruin...
[k]

＠Gawain
It would seem the moment is mete to stop, lamentably.
[k]

？1：We blazed through the second half...

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gawain
Hahaha. Lady Cat is a force of nature. Let's just say that eating a few Evil Bones is part of her feral charm.

[charaFace A 5]
＠Gawain
The remaining three, however, acted in a most evil and premeditated fashion. I had neither mercy nor sympathy for the likes of them.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Gawain
And so my Galatine became the instrument of their punishment!
[k]

？2：You've got talent as a collections agent.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gawain
Hah! This was something of a first for me, but I am glad it went well.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Gawain
I heed all cries for aid. A knight of my position is needed even outside of battle.
[k]

＠Gawain
In short, I am a jack-of-all-trades.[sr]If you, Master, need anything, please let me know.
[k]

？！

＠Gawain
Anyway, the case is closed.
[k]

＠Gawain
I have fewer materials than when we began, but I will simply have to collect them again.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Gawain
Our fight continues. With you, even our daily training is a joyous task, Master.
