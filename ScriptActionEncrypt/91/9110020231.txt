So it seems. I thought she was like Jeanne, another[sr]Heroic Spirit twisted by the Grail, but[line 3]
[k]

＠Saber Alter
It seems she was twisted from before.[sr]Enough that she herself didn't know who she was.

？1：What are we going to do about this?

？2：Saber, the world's collapsing!

＠Saber Alter
Don't worry, this is Altera's dream.[sr]Since she disappeared, the dream will wake up.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
Our minds will return as the world ends.[sr]It may leave a small aftertaste, but do not fret.

S-So we're experiencing a simulation of the end of the world... This is the kind of bad feeling I don't want to know...

Once this world ends, let us meet again. Don't worry[sr][%1], it wasn't a complete waste.

I-I knew it[line 4]!
[k]

？2：Mash, close your eyes if you're scared.

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
I-I can't![sr]Closing my eyes just makes me more scared!
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
I'm done doing favors for Alter! Senpai, next time,[sr]think more about your actions, okay!
