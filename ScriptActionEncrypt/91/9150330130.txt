...All right, listen up, brave Argonauts.

＠Circe
Let's go over the dispelling ritual one more time.

＠Circe
This elixir I whipped up will make ephemeral concepts corporeal for a short while.
[k]

＠Circe
Once you sprinkle it over the hull, it'll make its curse something you can touch[line 2]or, more to the point, hit.
[k]

＠Circe
If you can defeat the curse before the elixir's effects run out, the Argo should then be free of it for good.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Circe
But be warned: if you fail to defeat it, it'll get even stronger and come back to haunt this ship with a vengeance.

So the curse will take the form of a monster, huh.[sr]I suppose it being only one monster would be too much to hope for?

If not, that's where Theseus'll come in!

Now that Heracles is gone, there's no one else on the crew who can match his might. Haaahaha!

So, before it comes to that...I'm willing to lend a hand myself.

＠Theseus
I think it's wonderful that[sr]you'll be joining the fray.
[k]

＠Theseus
I only hope that the ship doesn't get wrecked again now that it's almost repaired.
[k]

＠Theseus
Also there're some ominous clouds making their way toward this island. If the seas start acting up, there's no telling what might happen to the ship.

It's the curse pulling those storm clouds here. How is that a surprise? Of course the gods aren't gonna be thrilled about this, you jagoff.

Nonetheless...I swear to Hecate that your[sr]sails will be filled with wind again.
