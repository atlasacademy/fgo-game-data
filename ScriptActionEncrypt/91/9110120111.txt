It's quite similar to a certain place in Britain.

A place of peace... Well, admittedly this tranquil place is where I allow my mind to race.
[k]

＠Bedivere
It is a place that helps me renew my resolve and reinvigorate my soul. So it may be a stretch to call this place a place of peace.

Our Britain was a nation under constant threat of attack, never peaceful or stable.

Many fell victim to that strife,[sr]and I could do nothing to save them.

The Giant of Mont Saint-Michel. A fearsome giant was wreaking havoc on Mont Saint-Michel of Brittany...
[k]

＠Bedivere
...and kidnapped Princess Helena,[sr]the niece of the King of Brittany.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Our King Arthur took Sir Kay and myself to hunt the giant down and rescue her.

King Arthur and Sir Kay defeated the giant in a gruesome battle and brought some peace to Brittany.

＠Bedivere
On the other hand, I...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

...I could not save the princess.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I was too late, powerless as I am.[sr]All too little, too late.

Princess Helena, known for her grace, had her young and promising life plucked away, and we found only her pitiful corpse.

Master, I am a weak, powerless man who does not deserve to be numbered among the Knights of the Round Table.

＠Bedivere
And yet[line 2]No, because of that, I offer you this vow, knowing that my manifestation here was truly a miracle:
[k]

＠Bedivere
I shall protect you, Master, who fights these brutal battles to defend humanity's future.
