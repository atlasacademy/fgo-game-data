＠Gilgamesh
So you defeated it. After fighting it, I found it to be nothing more than a boring monster.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Hatred cannot dwell in a silent machine. That was the obsession of the fool who made the Greater Grail.

O King of Heroes, what do you mean?

＠Gilgamesh
The hatred of the enemy that Chaldea seeks, the one who seeks to incinerate the history of man.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I have little interest in the battle this time around.[sr]I don't care who's the mastermind.

＠Gilgamesh
However[line 3] This I shall say. [%1], what you're chasing is an avatar of hatred.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Of course, there are different types of hatred.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Hatred born of righteousness, or love.[sr]Hatred born of jealousy, or anger.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Gilgamesh
This hatred is[line 3][sr]Yes, it is a most “foolish” hatred.

＠Mash
A foolish hatred?[sr]Generally speaking, hatred is not good for anyone.
[k]

＠Mash
But from a broader perspective, there is neither “good hatred” nor “bad hatred.” In that case, my King, what makes you call it foolish?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Gilgamesh
Idiot. Look at what's around you. Nothing is born, nothing is achieved... The ultimate form of idleness.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Gilgamesh
If this isn't foolish, what is!?[sr]Nothing here is saved!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Gilgamesh
Listen, Mash. May it be evil or foolish, all actions result in benefit.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
But this kind of hatred exists as well: the hatred of a fool obsessed with leaving nothing behind.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Gilgamesh
...It matters not.[sr]Someday you shall face this thing.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
And when you do, remember what it is you fought to protect.

＠Dr. Roman
The problem with this king is that he occasionally says things that seem significant.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Well, we should keep his words in mind, with a grain of salt that is. Okay, let's head back, [%1].
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It seems like the King's in a better mood.
[k]

？1：...Hold on, we forgot something...

？2：...Um, where's my reward?

？！

Oh, that's right. The King promised a reward.

He said if we beat this monster he'd reward us!

Fool. Would I ever break a promise?[sr]The reward has been granted already.

One way or another, you'll understand during the next battle. Boorish fool, don't make me explain everything to you.
