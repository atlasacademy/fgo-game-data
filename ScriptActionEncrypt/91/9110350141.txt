...I almost feel as though I am dreaming.

＠Diarmuid
Yet I doubt even the gods or the Fairy King could ever have conceived of something so wondrous as this.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
Truly, I could ask for no better parting gift.

But please, do not worry about me.[sr]My Lancer Spirit Origin is perfectly capable.

＠Diarmuid
I am still me, whether I carry sword or spear,[sr]and I will continue to wield them for your sake.

Perhaps we can remedy that some other day,[sr]Sir Diarmuid.
[k]

＠Altria
As I see it, it may be best simply to summon your new Spirit Origin here...
[k]

＠Altria
...but it is only through fate that we may have another chance to duel.
[k]

＠Altria
And so, while I cannot give you my word,[sr]I can at least say this much:

[charaFace C 1]
＠Altria
I hope we will meet again some day,[sr]Diarmuid Ua Duibhne of the Knights of Fianna.
