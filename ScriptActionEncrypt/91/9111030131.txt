I did. That's right.[sr]And now I'm going to kill them again.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I won't let anyone[line 2]not some big damn noble hero, or a loser antihero[line2]take this from me.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I killed you, I killed your followers,[sr]I killed the civilians, I killed them all.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I'm not here to make excuses. I'm not here for salvation. I'm not here for punishment. This isn't FUN for me.

I'm just fulfilling my duty as a Servant!

＠Jeanne Alter
Master, do you know?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Charles VII, the one you know from the history books...
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
He ordered a retrial for me[line 2]no, for Jeanne d'Arc[line 2][sr]eighteen years after her death.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
He testified to her innocence, her honesty,[sr]and her bravery on the battlefield.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Due to his testimony, among many others,[sr]the original sentence was overturned.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Jeanne Alter
...Maybe he wanted to make amends.[sr]Or maybe he just did it to ease his own conscience.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Or maybe, he did it hoping to save Jeanne... But once you're dead, you're just lost in the endless abyss.

You're right.[sr]I don't know, and I don't give a rat's ass.

＠Jeanne Alter
If anything, the other me would be happy that...[sr]No, [charaFace B 5]she wouldn't care, either.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
She's not the sort to worry about her reputation after her death. Actually, she didn't seem to care even while she was alive.

How it happened doesn't matter. What matters is that this incident has been resolved the way it should.
[k]

＠Geronimo
What's more, you didn't let anyone else do this for you, easy as it would have been to do so.
[k]

＠Geronimo
The logic behind your resolve, your dignity...[sr]Those are what makes you a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Geronimo
Jeanne Alter, by your actions you have proven yourself to be a just and proper Servant.

Time to get on with restoring Humanity.[sr]Say your goodbyes to this hellhole.

＠Jeanne Alter
Don't worry, death has been wiped away from this land. One day, life will flourish here once again, even though my sin will forever stain this place.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
That's just the way things should be.
