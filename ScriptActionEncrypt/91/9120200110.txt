Hi! What a wonderful day here in Chaldea, don't you think, Master? By the way, I have something to ask you.

In exchange for my invaluable assistance, you promised me some valuables from you-know-who's treasury...

Yes, they were valid. And that's why you're going to keep your word, correct?

[charaFace A 8]
＠Ishtar
Forsaking an oath made to a goddess is a grave,[sr]grave crime.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Normally, I'd punish you by dropping you into my mini Venus so you could suffer in its incredible winds for a decade or so...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Ishtar
But since we're such good friends, [%1], we'll set that particular punishment aside.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Ishtar
Honestly, making such a huge bluff in a situation so dire took real guts, which means you must be a reliable Master.
[k]

＠Ishtar
But...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Ishtar
Any oath I make binds me as well,[sr]even if it's just a verbal contract.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Ishtar
I'm sure you all know what happens if an oath a goddess makes is broken...right?
[k]

？1：Right...Quetzalcoatl...
？2：That's...not good...

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Ishtar
Exactly.[sr]I'm glad you're keeping up here.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Ishtar
In this case, if you do not give me my promised reward, you will face swift and severe divine punishment.
[k]

＠Ishtar
It's up to you whether Chaldea[sr]here ends up like Mt. Ebih.
[k]

？1：Making Chaldea into an awfu[line 2]err, awe-inspiring shrine!?
？2：Did you hear that, Mash?[csr]We'll be so much closer to the underworld.

I'm heading somewhere to collect a reward, and if you help me out, I will forgive your debt and crimes.
