Once the Rheingold disappears from this nation, any related memories will also be erased and return to normal.

＠Siegfried
Let's hurry before we have casualties.

No need to be surprised.[sr]You're not the only one who obtained the Rheingold.

I, Hagen, killed you to acquire it.

Hagen...I believe he was the one who[sr]killed Siegfried from behind...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
It seems he was summoned using the Rheingold as the catalyst.
[k]

＠Hagen
Exactly. Though, I only did it because this guy asked me.[sr]Right, my friend?

...If you think of me as a friend, stand aside Hagen.
[k]

＠Hagen
I refuse. This treasure is mine.[sr]I killed you to obtain it.
[k]

＠Hagen
I won't give it to a wench like Kriemhild.[sr]I won't give it to a coward like you who chose death!
[k]

＠Hagen
This gold! This treasure![sr]Everything is mine!

＠Siegfried
[line 2]No matter what I say, it will only be an excuse.
[k]

＠Siegfried
It's true that I am a coward. I should have stood firm,[sr]and found a way to break through.
[k]

＠Siegfried
That tragedy was not one I schemed...[sr]Even then, there's no doubt that I am responsible.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Siegfried
...However.[sr]I will retrieve the Rheingold.
[k]

＠Siegfried
Not for my own greed,[sr]but because it is just.
[k]

＠Hagen
[line 2]Haha. Says the man who wielded[sr]his sword not knowing what is just!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Siegfried
You're correct. When I was alive,[sr]I wielded my sword in ignorance.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Siegfried
However, lately I have finally been able to see my own righteousness.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Siegfried
I will have my wish granted[line 2][sr]Hagen!
