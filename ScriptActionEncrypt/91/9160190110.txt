＠
Apparently I seldom cried as a child, though it was my drunken father who told me this.
[k]

＠
It's normal for a baby to cry for its mother...
[k]

＠
But apparently I spent my days looking[sr]up at the sky with my mouth agape.
[k]

＠
My father was a teacher. He taught others the basics of the shinobi, its philosophy and logic.
[k]

＠
But that wasn't enough.[sr]Not nearly enough.
[k]

＠
As long as one's memory is fresh, passing the teachings through oral instruction is the most accurate method. But as life goes on and one's memory begins to fade, that method becomes less reliable.
[k]

＠
At that point, recording teachings in text is the[sr]best method, but its accuracy is then questioned.
[k]

＠
In order to perfect the ninjutsu that Fuuma created, oral instruction and a clear mental acuity so one neither forgets nor is forgotten are best.

＠Danzo
So you're the fifth leader of the clan.
[k]

＠
I shake my head in denial. As long as the fourth[sr]leader still lives, I am not the fifth leader.
[k]

＠Danzo
Incorrect. You will soon be the fifth leader. And the shinobi techniques that I have been entrusted with must be passed along to you in order for you to become what you are destined to be.
[k]

＠Danzo
Everything...I shall teach you and pass down everything. Now please...give me your hand.

And from then on, until I grew[sr]to adulthood, I called her Mother.
[k]

＠
Every time I called her that, she would tilt her head as if confused. But in my mind, anyone who teaches somebody something is to be considered a parent.
[k]

＠
That's why I thought I should call her Mother.

The age of the shinobi was coming to an end. The Houjou clan perished, and the nation was being unified.

The Fuuma clan was convinced that their end was near. The Fuuma as ninjas, at the least, would end here.

But should that happen...what would happen to you?

＠Danzo
Do not worry yourself over that.[sr]I can no longer move anyway.

For five generations, I have[sr]been watching over the Fuuma.
[k]

＠Danzo
My operational period is long since passed, and I can no longer recall the faces of the previous leaders.
[k]

＠Danzo
The techniques of the shinobi...even throwing[sr]a shuriken...all gone from my memory.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Danzo
The only thing that remains within me is...your face.
[k]

＠Danzo
That's why, I ask that you do the role of my kaishaku, to behead me, in one sweep. I am asking you, personally, to do this for me.
[k]

＠Danzo
And by doing so, I can declare you to be my greatest accomplishment and masterpiece of the Fuuma clan.

The strongest...the last...the best ninja.

If an error occurred in summoning Katou Danzo,[sr]its source likely lies in this dreamed-of Japan.

You will need to settle the matter there.

＠Holmes
That woman you fought is the worst. I'm sure[sr]she has no intention of becoming a Servant here.

＠Holmes
But that one planted some seeds and left them[sr]behind. Think of this as one of them sprouting.

And it has, in turn, caused this error.

Precisely. And that's why you should[sr]head over there in its proper time.

I've already asked Miss Da Vinci to prepare a Rayshift. Now go and settle this once and for all.

＠
The Fuuma flourished for five generations, and those who learned the Fuuma technique numbered well over one hundred. But in my opinion...
[k]

＠
The one who reached the Fuuma's true ideal[sr]was its fifth leader. And only him.
[k]

＠
He, in whose veins runs the blood of an outsider, and the blood of the oni, made manifest through magecraft.
[k]

＠
His blood was mixed, and he himself[sr]had incredible latent ability.
[k]

＠
Naturally talented...is perhaps the best way to describe him. That innate talent was what the first Lord Fuuma strove to have; to be a ninja exactly like him.
[k]

＠
But there was one thing that god did not grant him.
[k]

＠
It was the desire for praise. The drive to get to the top, even if it meant sabotaging others, just did not exist within him.
[k]

＠
Had he possessed such characteristic, no doubt he would have been quietly by the bedside of the general who unified the nation.
[k]

＠
As a result, the Fuuma clan was on[sr]the verge of extinction. Or rather...
[k]

＠
The Fuuma clan's goal had likely been accomplished[sr]the moment the fifth Fuuma Kotarou was born.
[k]

＠
The greatest shinobi, who, though human,[sr]brought the power of the oni with him.
[k]

＠
Perhaps that was the first leader's[line 2]and Kashin Koji's[line 2]aim.
[k]

＠
No... I am only a puppet.[sr]Such things are not my concern.
