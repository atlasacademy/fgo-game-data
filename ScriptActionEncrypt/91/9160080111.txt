You'll take the job? You said you'll take the job, right? Ohoho, you should have said so from the get-go!

Yes. If she needs me that much, I cannot refuse.
[k]

＠Georgios
To be honest, her dazzling form was quite blinding.[sr]In fact, I was nearly blinded several times.

Georgios...does that mean...are[sr]you actually blind now...?

I've arranged it so that King David[sr]will be there as a special guest.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Georgios
He has many moving stories to tell. He has the power to make his listeners go into a trance. So he should be able to carry the meeting for now.

How the other saints will listen and react[sr]to King David's story is intriguing in itself...

＠Mash
But everything has been arranged.[sr]Now let us head to this photography session...

(Gasp!)[charaShake A 0.05 4 2 0.7][sr]No, I forgot one other crucial detail!
[k]

？1：Now what!?

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cleopatra
The background! There is absolutely no way[sr]we are doing a shoot in this dingy cave!
[k]

＠Cleopatra
...Actually, I wonder why the Saints' Club meets in a place like this. But let's leave that aside for now.
[k]

？2：It's about the shooting site, isn't it?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cleopatra
Exactly. Of course my Master could figure that out.[sr]I want a photo shoot to match a Hollywood star!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cleopatra
If my beauty is to be preserved in a photo,[sr]there must also be a suitable background!
[k]

＠Cleopatra
So there you have it. Let's continue our Rayshifting in search of the perfect background for the shoot!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cleopatra
Mash, go ahead with the preparations![sr]If you're shorthanded, use all of Chaldea's staff!
[k]

＠Cleopatra
There's no need to pay them extra for this![sr]The privilege of looking upon me is reward enough!
[k]

＠Cleopatra
Oh, but my bright and dazzling form will cause some of the staff to go blind. I guess I would have to offer them extra pay to compensate them.

Well, basically everything she's[sr]doing just shouts “Cleopatra”...

Anyway, it appears that I need[sr]to make some preparations.

＠Mash
I'm going to grin and bear it and[sr]help out in Cleopatra's photo shoot!
