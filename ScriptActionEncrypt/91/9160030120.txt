Based on what happened with Blackbeard,[sr]we're looking for someone small and cute.
[k]

？1：I'm sure we'll find them soon.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Yes.[sr]Let's keep that positive attitude.

Someone small and cute... Well, there are a lot of people like that in Chaldea.

Overall combat efficiency aside, Gozul is probably the strongest of all of us when it comes to sheer arm power. I do not think he is at a disadvantage.

Those are all just methods we might employ to win the competition.
