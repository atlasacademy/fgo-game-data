My theory that the universe corresponds to the anatomy of the human body...

What intrigues me is that much what you've said seems to contradict the teachings of Theosophy as a field.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Theosophy as a field involves study and exploration. Its pursuit of the truth of the world and gods is similar to what we mages do...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
But it is still just an academic field.[sr]It's not that Theosophy is similar to mages...

It's true that I was the one who spread Theosophy to the modern world, but in broader terms, it was like a new kind of Platonism or Gnosticism...
