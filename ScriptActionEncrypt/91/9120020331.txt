Whoa... Not only that, this guy is dirt poor!

＠Dr. Roman
Dragons are generally known for hoarding treasure, but this one's lair is as empty as its skull!

There's nothing good about this dragon!

Is that true!? I cannot believe my eyes... His treasury is completely empty...

It must have wasted everything on trying to build its labyrinth...

＠Gilgamesh
Couldn't even scrounge up some treasure to leave at the finish line, the worthless fool...

That's right. My King, you said earlier you wanted to test Senpai's worth...

Is that just you being considerate? So that Senpai can be acknowledged as a proper Master?

A proper Master? The day this [&boy:girl] becomes a proper Master, this world shall no doubt be saved already.

＠Gilgamesh
I simply came here to sharpen the edge of my treasured sword, Ea. I was sure Ea would end up in a good mood if it faced a dragon.

＠Gilgamesh
However... Hm... [%1], you have done well for a mongrel.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Our enemy was the worst this time, but I shall find you worthy prey next time.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Accept that as the proof of your own growth. You have become a mage worthy of hunting the most exquisite prey.
[k]

？1：You're right.

？2：Thank you for your gracious words, O King of Heroes.

＠Gilgamesh
Hmph, it was but a trivial matter. No need to thank me. Now then, it's time to go; I have no more use for this miserable place.

I don't think so. He might just be bored of us. Ultimately, that man has no concept of embarrassment or sympathy.

...Either way, there's no doubt he has acknowledged us.

I was a little nervous and unsure of what's going to happen when he formed a contract with us... But his arrogance and self-righteousness is rather reliable now.

Fooou!
