The place where the unbeatable rebel Mordred met an ignoble end at King Arthur's hands, as you know.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mordred
...So you might wanna get psyched, Master.[sr]If this dream is a match for my memories...

You wanna kill me so bad you[sr]even came to my dream, huh?
[k]

＠Mordred
You really hate me that much?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mordred
Well, that sure proves this is a dream.[sr]You're nothing like the real person.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mordred
If Father had actually hated me that much,[sr]my life would've turned out way different.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mordred
Then again...in another sense,[sr]maybe this is my dream being kind to me.
