We made it past the giants! That's the[sr]Heroic Spirit Altera, the one we saw in Rome!

That's what I want to know, white Heroic Spirit.[sr]Mash called you Altera, but[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Saber Alter
Are you really Altera? You don't seem like[sr]the conqueror they called the Scourge of God.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Altera
...You disturb my dream, and then insult me?[sr]You are...Britain's King of Knights, yes?
[k]

＠Altera
I am Altera.[sr]My appearance and this blade are proof of that.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Altera
[line 3]Answer me.[sr]What makes you doubt the truth that I speak?
[k]

＠Altera
If your answer displeases me, I'll show no mercy.[sr]I'll incinerate you and this world.

(Senpai, she seems to understand us more, but she sounds a lot more angry!)

(But I understand that feeling.)

＠Mash
(If this is Altera's dream, it would be embarrassing for others to see it!)
[k]

？1：Sorry, we didn't mean to pry into your dreams...

[charaFace E 4]
＠Altera
...It doesn't matter if you intended to or not.[sr]The fact is, you're humiliating me.
[k]

？2：You've got some crazy dreams.

[charaFace E 4]
＠Altera
...I know.[sr]Even I don't know why I have these dreams.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Altera
But[line 3]that's why I can't forgive you.[sr]You have peeked into my inexplicable dreams.
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 5]
＠Altera
Answer me.[sr]Why do you mock me so?

＠Saber Alter
...Why, you ask?[sr]I finally understand now after coming here.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Saber Alter
Oh great conqueror and Heroic Spirit Altera.[sr]You have become a paradox.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
Some kings conquer to satisfy their people.[sr]Some kings rule to satisfy their own greed.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
Each definition of kingship varies.[sr]Everyone has their own ideology, and justifiable goals.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Saber Alter
But[line 3]you are different.[sr]You are a conqueror and a destroyer.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
Some kings bring destruction in their conquest,[sr]but no king brings destruction after a conquest.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
That is not a king who rules man.[sr]That is a Demon God who denies the world of man.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Saber Alter
I ask again, Heroic Spirit Altera.[sr]Are you really[line 3]a Heroic Spirit like us?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Altera
[line 3]I have no answer for that. As the head of the Huns,[sr]I simply fought and slew our enemy.
[k]

＠Altera
It was you people who called me a king, a hero, a God of War.
[k]

＠Altera
Or would you, a fellow Heroic Spirit, deny me?[sr]Just like me, you can only destroy.

＠Altera
[line 3]I don't like you.[sr]I don't like you at all.
[k]

＠Altera
Begone from my dream. This plain of destruction[sr]is mine alone. I don't want to see any humans!

Wow... All the Mana in the atmosphere is being drawn into her blade!
[k]

＠Mash
So that is the Sword of Mars, the Noble Phantasm that can incinerate the world!
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]
[charaFace D 1]
[charaFadein D 0.1 2]
＠Saber Alter
Excellent. Altera herself was a disappointment,[sr]but that Noble Phantasm is a worthy foe.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
If it's going to swallow all the Mana in the world,[sr]it will be an excellent opponent.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Saber Alter
My heart is that of a dragon.[sr]The Od in my body shall resist the breath of the World.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
Let's go, Master![sr]It's time to see whose Noble Phantasm is the strongest!
