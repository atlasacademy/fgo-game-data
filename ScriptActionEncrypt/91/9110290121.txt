I am Rome, and Rome is I. As all roads lead to Rome,[sr]so do I possess knowledge of all things.

＠Romulus
And so, my child, I know where your destination lies.[sr]Ahh, my dear child.
[k]

＠Romulus
This may not be where your journey will ultimately end, but it is a fine place to stop and gaze up at the stars.
[k]

＠Romulus
You are so focused on what tomorrow brings that you pay the sky no heed, but that is a mistake, my child.
[k]

＠Romulus
As you have paused your journey for now, this is the time to cast your gaze upward and behold the stars.
[k]

＠Romulus
Indeed, it is for that purpose that you have come here.

Now that Beast I has appeared in this world, it is only a matter of time until Beast VI follows suit.

When it does, it will devour everything. People... Cities... Prosperity... Corruption... All of civilization.

But I was wrong. I should have told you what I'm about to say the moment we formed a contract.

Master, please lend me your strength, that I may win this battle. In return I will devote myself to helping you succeed in yours.
