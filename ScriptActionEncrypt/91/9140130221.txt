And after Master came all this way.

This was the perfect moment for me to have had kykeon ready to serve, and I didn't. I blew it.

＠C：[servantName 503300:Caster of Okeanos:Circe]
I only get one chance to meet the sailors that stop by this island. Once that passes, that's it, they're gone... Not even coming back as a Heroic Spirit is enough to let me forget the ones that got away...

Master... Do you think you could say something to the Queen Witch to help her feel better?
[k]

？1：Kykeon is the only food that I always wants seconds of!
？2：I'll come back for kykeon once you have some honey again!

Really? You mean it? You promise? I'm gonna turn you into a pig if you're lying, okay?

Well, okay then. I guess I can wait. I'll make sure everything's ready the next time you come here.

All right, Queenie, you got what you came for, yeah? Good! Now get lost. Besides, you stink of fairies and alcohol, and I'm sick of it.

Hmph, I was just leaving anyway. I still have to get the last component, after all.

＠Medb
Although...this one's going to be the biggest hassle. You have to do a little ritual thing to get it.
