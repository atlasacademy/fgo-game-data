＠Dr. Roman
It feels so bizarre, you know? He was one of the[sr]masterminds behind Project Demonic Fog...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...but now he's one of our allies. A miracle[sr]of the Heroic Spirit summoning system, I suppose.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
But I admit I was startled when he said that[sr]he wanted to go to "the London of that era."

＠Paracelsus
That's understandable. I attempted to commit[sr]vile crimes against the world and its people.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
It's logical for you to doubt me.[sr]However[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Paracelsus
I truly do not wish for the human world to be destroyed.[sr]Thus, I sympathize with your goals and objectives.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
Now I believe that it's possible[sr]to save all of my beloved children.

...My former self running that Project[sr]may have laughed in contempt at such a notion.

＠Paracelsus
But now... Now that I've entered[sr]into a contract with [%1].
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Paracelsus
I have faith once again.[sr]In people. In the world.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
...In the existence of allies of justice capable of fighting evil.

That is none other than all of you. You defeated me[sr]as I reached out to the Project at the edge of despair.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
Allow me to say the following[sr]with the deepest gratitude.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Paracelsus
Thank you.[sr]I beg you to show me your power once more.

It depends on the situation.[sr]Mr. Paracelsus.

＠Mash
You mentioned unusual changes occurring in London[sr]as it corrects itself[line 2]that is what you claim?
[k]

[charaTalk C]
＠Paracelsus
Yes.
[k]

[charaTalk A]
＠Mash
What do you mean by "unusual changes?"[sr]The Demonic Fog is gradually dissipating.
[k]

＠Mash
As the era is corrected, London should return to normal[sr]without having to wait for the Demonic Fog to clear up.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
And yet,[sr]you seem to be agitated.
[k]

＠Mash
Why is that[line 2]
[k]

？1：He senses something?

？2：He knows something?

To Master's query, all I can say is this.[sr]Yes and no.

＠Paracelsus
It's true that I sense some kind of connection.[sr]But I also know that there's something in this place.

[charaFace C 4]

Never mind. Let us speak later.[sr]Something remaining in the Demonic Fog approaches.

He's right![sr]Multiple magical energy readings detected in the fog!
