But I understand your situation.[sr]This time I shall permit you to use my husband.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Eric
However, my husband is unable to fully unleash his[sr]power. That's because of his weapon, the Bloodaxe.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Eric
This is the blood-stained axe formed out of the flesh and blood of demonic beasts.
[k]

＠Eric
When allowed to drink the blood of several demonic beasts, its true power will be unleashed.
