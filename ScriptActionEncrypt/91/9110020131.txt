Enemy Servant annihilation confirmed...[sr]Whew. That was a tough fight...
[k]

＠Saber Alter
...Sympathy for two people who fell to evil, huh?[sr]I can't deny that.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
I chose to rule by violence and instinct, and you chose to rule by fear and reason.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
The more a Heroic Spirit was bound by ideals in their former life, the more they possess a twisted side like us.
[k]

？1：Saber...

？2：You and that Jeanne are different.

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Saber Alter
That's just what you believe.[sr]But[line 3]a Servant obeys their Master.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
As long as you believe that, I won't be a fool and believe otherwise.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Saber Alter
Also, your skills have[sr]improved a bit [%1].
[k]

？1：Of course!

？2：A little, but yeah.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Saber Alter
Glad to hear it.[sr]Let's return to Chaldea.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
Women like Jeanne and I are only useful like this.[sr]If there's a next time, I'll find you another strong foe.

You're back![sr]What happened to you two?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Communications went dead, and for a moment the Humanity Foundation value for Fuyuki and France reverted to negative!

＠Dr. Roman
Okay, I'll call an end to this Rayshift for now...[sr]But something seems strange.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
You guys didn't go to an amusement park or[sr]something without me, right? ...Nah, no way!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's no way you could just Rayshift to the Greater Grail, and fight a bonus stage with powerful opponents you've already encountered!
