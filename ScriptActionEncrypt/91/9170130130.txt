...Ahem![sr]Master, would you mind averting your eyes?

You see, I'm not used to being looked at.[sr]Thank you so much.

＠Kiyohime
Oh, my! Such a large cavern...[sr]It's so mystical.
[k]

＠Mash
...A cavern like this seems like the best place for[sr]a dragon to keep its treasure in...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
But obviously there's no dragon here.[sr]Yet, I do sense something.
[k]

＠Mash
Master, be careful.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Kiyohime
It's exactly as Mash says.[sr]Please stay behind me.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Kiyohime
Do not fret. No matter what sort of[sr]monster it may be, I shall protect you.
[k]

＠???
[line 2]I wouldn't be so sure about that.[sr]Excuse me, my dear self. May I ask you a question?

Do you really think you're qualified to be a Servant?

You who killed the man you loved out of hate, spite, and[sr]fury? Can you really swear to protect your next Master?

You're...me?
[k]

＠Kiyohime (?)
Impossible! Utterly impossible![sr]Because you are just a lowly beast.
[k]

＠Kiyohime (?)
Quit showing your pretty self, and expose your hideous[sr]form. If you think you'll be loved then, you're kidding yourself.
[k]

＠Kiyohime (?)
Does a soldier show the one he loves what he's like[sr]when he cruelly slaughters on the battlefield?
[k]

＠Kiyohime (?)
People express their love by hiding something.[sr]But in your case, it is deception[line 2]
[k]

＠Kiyohime (?)
By deceiving, don't you think you are forcing[sr]a human to love a beast?
[k]

＠Kiyohime (?)
It's true, is it not? You, even after[sr]revealing your true identity, shamelessly[line 2]
[k]

＠Kiyohime (?)
You pursued him!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Kiyohime
No... I never... Did...
[k]

＠Kiyohime (?)
Now then, Master.[sr]You must discard this creature.
[k]

＠Kiyohime (?)
Someday, this woman will reveal her true self[sr]over some petty lie, and sink her fangs into your neck.
[k]

＠Kiyohime (?)
It is much more sensible to reject that woman.
[k]

？1：Never!

？2：I refuse to.

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Kiyohime
Master...
[k]

＠Kiyohime (?)
I see. You are very kind.[sr]Just like that Anchin was.
[k]

＠Kiyohime (?)
But can you look upon Kiyohime's miserable, hideous form and still say that[line 2]Why don't you try?
