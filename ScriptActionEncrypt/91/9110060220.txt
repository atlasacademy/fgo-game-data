＠Nero Bride
This will be an item of great sentimental value between us! It must be absolutely perfect! No compromises! Time to start over from scratch!

＠Nero Bride
Hm. Damn. I cannot believe I of all people would make such a rudimentary mistake!
[k]

＠Nero Bride
I forgot to engrave our names on the sword!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Nero Bride
Good thing I caught the mistake![sr]I truly am a genius, and a lucky one at that!
[k]

＠Nero Bride
That's okay! I'll just start over again![sr]I'm really getting in the zone now, Master!
[k]

？1：Like engraving our initials inside a heart!
？2：Okay, Nero, what the hell?

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Nero Bride
Don't get so excited. This will be the last one![sr]This will be an absolute masterpiece!

The dragon of the overflowing fountain of demonic energy: Avaritia! Hm? Why do I know this...?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Nero Bride
...Hm, I suppose it just kind of slipped out.[sr]That does happen with me sometimes, you know...
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Nero Bride
Regardless, I can assure you that it is a terribly powerful enemy! It is truly an offering worthy for the creation of my Noble Phantasm!

＠Nero Bride
If you have any pride as my Master, show me you can claim that creature's crown!
