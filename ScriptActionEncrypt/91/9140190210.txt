＠Mash
Yes, Martha's on edge, isn't she?[sr]Ever since we came to this era.
[k]

＠Mash
There's something wrong in Ancient Rome, in the Second Singularity.[sr]It was her[line 2]It was Martha who told us that.
[k]

＠Mash
I assume it's not a good news.[sr]Could it be related to the dragons again?

I have no idea[line 2]

＠Martha
...Normally.
[k]

＠Martha
It's normally not possible, because all souls are under God's divine grace.
[k]

＠Martha
Wandering the Earth, not going to either Heaven or Hell.

Such acts are not allowed, I mean, all of the...

Yes, you're right! You're definitely right![sr]Souls wandering the Earth is normally "not possible!"

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Sending them back to God's grace, yes.[sr]But ghost-type monsters, really?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They only exist because of magecraft, they aren't "naturally" generated.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In other words, they aren't part of nature.[sr]But, hold on, if that's the case then Heroic Spirits[line 2]
