Personally, I can't help but think the foresight to not just let everyone in willy-nilly is prooobably pretty important when it comes to security.

That may be, but the situation remains far too precarious for comfort. Other Servants sympathetic to our cause are taking great pains not to speak A's name in front of P...
[k]

＠Holmes
...but then, there are plenty of Servants who delight in mischief or destruction with no such qualms.
[k]

＠Holmes
I can only surmise that the reason such Servants have not already done so is because they are either unaware of A and P's relationship, or of the fact that the situation is as volatile as it is.

Which is to say that we have thus far[sr]avoided disaster only through good fortune.

So, while P is completely unaware of Achi[line 2]

＠Mash
Er, I mean, while P is completely unaware of A being here, we should take this opportunity and come up with a plan.

Relationship, hmm... A good point. We should begin by making certain that we are all working with the same fundamental understanding of these two.

＠Holmes
And the one best suited to confirm that is,[sr]of course, you, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].
[k]

＠Holmes
Would you be so kind as to tell us your impressions of A and P again? No need to worry about maintaining objectivity.
[k]

＠Holmes
The question is, what does she think of him,[sr]and what does he, in turn, think about her?

It's hard to tell if P was always like this, or if her Berserker tendencies have affected her original personality...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...but it's not just that she wants to kill A, though that's certainly a significant motivating factor.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
More than anything, she wants to avenge the humiliation she suffered at his hands in the past.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Which is to say, she wants to face him again,[sr]fair and square, warrior to warrior, and win.

＠Hektor
I like to think I'm pretty good at[sr]giving people the runaround myself...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Hektor
So I can tell you pretty confidently that him doing so is his way of saying he has no intention of fighting her...
[k]

＠Hektor
Why is that? Because he thinks if they fight, he'll end up killing her. He really can't imagine any other outcome.
[k]

＠Hektor
And since if he killed her, she wouldn't be able[sr]to help Master anymore, he doesn't want to do that.
[k]

＠Hektor
But let's say Master wasn't part of this equation,[sr]and so that wasn't a concern for him.

Once again, he would refuse to fight,[sr]and simply offer himself up to be killed.
