That's right.[sr]Nightingale was the first person we met here.

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
I remember Master was injured at the time,[sr]so...I was extremely worried.
[k]

？1：I thought I was a goner.
？2：I thought Nightingale was going to kill me.
？！

＠Scheherazade
Medicine should be what holds death at bay. Normally, I would be very happy to be on good terms with those in the medical profession.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Scheherazade
But her... I just cannot bring myself to approach her... Her methods of treatment may be more deadly than any injury or ailment, I fear...
[k]



＠Scheherazade
I can handle some amount of pain and suppress my own fears when I know the treatment will help prevent my death, but in her case...
