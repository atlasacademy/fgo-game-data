＠Arjuna
I accept you as my Master, [%1]. But that doesn't mean I pledge my loyalty to you.
[k]

＠Arjuna
The most important thing in this world is trust. By fighting together, I was able to know you better.

[charaFace D 5]
＠Arjuna
But, that is not enough. Therefore, I would like to test you, Master.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Arjuna
It's simple. Just join me for three fights. During those fights, I will obey your every order.
[k]

＠Arjuna
On the other hand, I won't do anything aside from obeying your orders. How well you utilize me as a weapon...
[k]

＠Arjuna
That's what I want to see. Is that all right?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Arjuna
...Oh, there's no problem if you want the other Servants to help as well.

＠Arjuna
I'm looking forward to it.

I know this is sudden, but enemies are approaching. As always, enemies this level are easy prey for us.

＠Arjuna
I seek a graceful, quick delivery of instructions from you, Master. That is all.
