She took a lot of damage, but her frustration is making her forget her pain.
[k]

？1：Yeah, that's a good tantrum.
？2：Yeah, that's a good whipping.

Watch your mouth! That's infuriating![sr]I wasn't rejected, I just wasn't strong enough!
[k]

＠Medb
If I was in my proper state, I could seduce anybody, man or woman!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Medb
This only happened because you're not strong enough to properly handle me!
[k]

＠Medb
If you would've made me stronger, I could've kicked your butt!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Medb
All you guys at Chaldea are just a bunch of wimps! Put me in charge, and the restoration of humanity would be done in no time!
[k]

＠Medb
And [%1] wouldn't have to go to the front lines, but fight from somewhere safe!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Medb
Forget it! I'm leaving! Just make sure I'm stronger before the next fight!
[k]

＠Medb
I won't say how to make me stronger, though![sr]Just use a Holy Grail or something! A Holy Grail!
[k]

？1：Hahaha. Yeah, not happening.

[charaFace A 5]
＠Medb
How perfectly infuriating![sr]You dummy! I'll get you for this!
[k]

Yeah, I see her response over here.[sr]She's heading to the cafeteria at incredible speed.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Mmm, I bet she's going there to binge eat.[sr]I hope she doesn't eat all of Chaldea's food.
[k]

？1：Her frustration will help her gain maturity.
？2：The calories will help her gain weight.

？！

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Yeah. I was worried for a minute, but this should hopefully teach her a lesson!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
And now we know what abilities Medb was hiding.[sr]She can be even more helpful from here on out.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm sure it was Medb's way of getting closer to us. Though I doubt she realized it.

Yes. I think in her own way, Medb is starting to trust Master.
[k]

＠Mash
Since she's fighting out of frustration instead of hatred. Which means... you know.
[k]

？1：Yeah. She thinks of us as friends.

[charaFace B 13]
＠Mash
Right! I can't wait to battle her again next time!
