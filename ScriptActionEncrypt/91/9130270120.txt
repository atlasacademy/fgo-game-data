Isn't that like boasting you got paid, even though you skived off work? I believe that's quite unfair.

＠Stheno
It may be nice...but let's put that topic aside. There is just one thing I can't accept as the older sister.
[k]

＠Stheno
I really must say that we simply must do something about you being so small. It's not right to have you be the same size as us.

Oh, I know. I vaguely remember being[sr]with a super big person recently.

Our problem is because the three[sr]of us are lined up together.

If there was another person who is even bigger, Medusa's annoying short stature shouldn't stand out.
