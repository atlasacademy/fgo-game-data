Hmm, maybe you do have a point. As impressive as my swordsmanship is, my body does limit how I can employ it.

So, um, it turns out I've been here all along, but never mind that. I don't think you have any reason to worry. He didn't disappear; he just changed into his spirit form.

Besides, this is the simulator. Nobody disappears in here unless there's a really, really serious accident.

Well, um, I'm guessing that's because he also has the kind of sparkling charm that you do?

Maybe just spending so much time with you was enough for it to rub off on him...? Or something like that.

...Well, there's no point crying about it now. Besides, pharaohs don't get discouraged. Devastatingly depressed at times, maybe, but not discouraged. Besides, that was a long time ago.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
Anyway, Caesar was right about at least one thing.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
Master... My very first secretary.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]


＠Cleopatra
Now that I've promoted you to such an esteemed position, I would be a failure as a pharaoh if I didn't ensure you enjoyed each and every day you spent serving me.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Cleopatra
Wouldn't you agree? Yes, of course you would.[sr]No need to answer that!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Cleopatra
I want you to feel overwhelming joy and pride in being my secretary, and in having summoned me...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cleopatra
...So it's all right if you hold off on completely fulfilling my wish until you do.
