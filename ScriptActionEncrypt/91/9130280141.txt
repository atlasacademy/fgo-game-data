...I get it. That cat's tactic is just to go all-out. The moment we break through, her defenses weaken. Well then, I'll take this opportunity myself...

I'll have you know that these earrings of mine are family heirlooms, passed down by my parents. So that's why I can't take them off.

(Sigh) I guess I'm stuck with her a little longer.

＠Emiya
Sorry, Master.[sr]She doesn't mean any harm. Probably.
[k]

＠Emiya
She's trying to better the world in her own odd way. I'll take care of the rest.
[k]

＠Emiya
You go back to Chaldea and rest up. Me? Just keeping a cup of tea ready for me will be enough.

Yeah. I agree with [%1].[sr]He does seem like he is a little happy.

＠Da Vinci
He's the sort of Heroic Spirit who's always taking care of everyone else, but it always seemed like he kept his distance from Jaguar Warrior before.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Da Vinci
But it looks like he's given up and now he's tagging along with her. I'd say it all turned out okay.
