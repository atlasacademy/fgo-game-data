The time is now. I shall start the grand enterprise[sr]that I've been planning for a long time.

However, to make something perfect,[sr]you need unparalleled talent and resolve.

We're going to rebuild the Domus Aurea! My Noble[sr]Phantasm and the essence of my artist's soul[line 3]

In any event, we've come to the plains in search of the last required piece. Lend me a hand, [%1].

＠Nero
We need to be careful with money.[sr]Rebuilding the Golden Theater will be costly.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Nero
The materials, personnel, and my design fees! This time, let's try to do something about the material costs.

She's trying to improve her Noble Phantasm with[sr]money... Not a lot of Heroic Spirits would do that.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
So that's why you were trying to gather treasure before.[sr]But Your Majesty, can you strengthen your Noble Phantasm like that?

[charaFadein C 0.1 1]
＠Nero
Of course. The Golden Theater I created with my[sr]magical energy is based off the original that existed.
[k]

＠Nero
It's a matter of the image that's in my mind when I activate my Noble Phantasm. If we renovate the theater, I can sear that image in my mind.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Nero
That way, when I use my Noble Phantasm it should[sr]be just as extravagant and even more dazzling. That's the plan, anyway.

The more grand that Theater becomes,[sr]the more real the image becomes for Red Saber.
[k]

？1：I think it's already real enough, but...

＠Nero
Haha, don't compliment me now, [%1].[sr]You're so cute. Compliment me later.
[k]

？2：You're going to wear yourself out.

Dummy! Pushing yourself and pretending is the same thing! What's the point of not trying your best?

？！

In any event, the final material should appear soon.[sr]Everyone get ready for combat. This is going to be tough?

[charaFace A 6]

???[sr]It's going to appear?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

Just what are you going to have us make?

Isn't it obvious?[sr]A colosseum of sorts.

Umu, a new Golden Theater. A mix between a theater and a colosseum, a completely new way to watch someone fight.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Nero
...Well, there won't be any fighting in the Theater.[sr]I'm just going to make the entrance look like the Colosseum.

That's right.[sr]It came from the word "colossus."
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's a giant statue in front of the Colosseum[sr]in Rome that watches over the spectators.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 2]

[line 3]Oh, that's right. It was around the time[sr]of Emperor Nero when that colosseum[line 3]
