...According to legend,[sr]Brynhild and Altera were family.
[k]

＠Mash
It is said that Brynhild was the younger sister of King Atli, who many believe is based on Attila the Hun.

I've heard stories to that effect before,[sr]but I can't speak to it myself.

One of them said I married a princess after her husband was killed. I think his name was Siegfried? Sigurd? Something along those lines.

...Something about this doesn't make sense.

＠Mash
Altera, you're Attila the Hun,[sr]a figure from the fifth century.
[k]

＠Mash
But the Norse legends from the Saga and the Edda, including the one Wagner wrote about Brynhild, all came much later...
[k]

＠Mash
...so the timeline doesn't really seem to make sense.
[k]

？1：What do you mean?
？2：So you're saying the time periods don't match?

？！

＠Mash
Right. There's no way to reconcile[sr]the legends and stories.

First of all, Norse mythology has a legend[sr]regarding the end of the gods: Ragnarök.
[k]

＠Mash
It was said to be the last battle waged between gods and monsters. This battle would bathe the world in fire and smash the ground down into the sea.
[k]

＠Mash
And by the end of the war, gods, monsters,[sr]and giants would all cease to be.
[k]

＠Mash
You could call it another sort of ending to the Age of Gods. In time, the Norse world began a new age of humans, rather than one of gods.
[k]

[wt 1.0]

But it's unclear even now whether Brynhild's[sr]legend takes place before or after Ragnarök.

＠Da Vinci
Yep. If the story of Brynhild and Sigurd and her[sr]death took place after the Christian era began...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Da Vinci
...that is, if it took place after[sr]the end of the Age of Gods...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...it would mean that she and the other Valkyries would have been collecting souls for a war that was long over.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You've heard of the Valkyries before, right? They were a group of female warriors tasked with collecting the souls of fallen heroes to serve in the final battle.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Da Vinci
So you'd think that must mean Brynhild came from[sr]the Age of Gods, before Ragnarök, right? But as it turns out[line 2]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Mash
There is just no way that a story about[sr]a king of the Huns from the fifth century...
[k]

＠Mash
...would appear in a story that takes place[sr]during the Age of Gods and still make sense.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Da Vinci
For that matter, even in the world of magecraft, which is all about finding secret truths, opinions are mixed as to when exactly Ragnarök happened.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The most plausible theory puts it at around 1000 B.C.
[k]


＠Da Vinci
It says that the eruption of Mt. Katla at that time was actually the fires of Muspelheim rampaging across the earth...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Da Vinci
...and that in turn kicked off Ragnarök, the chain of events that led to the extinction of the Norse pantheon of gods as well as the giants.

＠Da Vinci
If we consider the Age of Gods to be a sort of civilization, then yes, you could say that.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
On the other hand, there's nothing in the geological record about a large-scale eruption of Katla taking place prior to A.D. 930.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Da Vinci
But then, how could there be[sr]with an entire texture missing!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Da Vinci
And by texture, I mean an entire layer of reality...the thin membrane covering this planet where our ecosystems exist.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That's why the Saga from the ninth century[sr]is the oldest known document we've got.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Humanity took a long time to collect those stories depicting the Norse Age of Gods in the Saga and [sr]Edda[line 2]

...Hmm. That does seem to be what[sr]they say in the world of magecraft.

＠Holmes
It took quite some time for mages to investigate and turn up anything about the eruption's aftermath and the end of the Norse Age of Gods.
[k]

＠Holmes
And there is yet a great deal of uncertainty about even that. Between all the conjecture and inference necessary to arrive at that conclusion, the extent to which it is factual is still very much in doubt.
