＠Siegfried
What, you were just venting?
[k]

＠Hagen
What else did you think it was?
[k]

＠Hagen
...I was happy when I could drink and joke with you.
[k]

＠Hagen
I'm the only one that could have assaulted you from behind in that situation.
[k]

＠Hagen
I can see you wanted it to be by my blade, as you trusted me.
[k]

＠Hagen
However[line 2]did you not imagine that you would hurt my heart doing so?
[k]

＠Hagen
Did you not think it would infuriate your wife Kriemhild?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Siegfried
...You're right.[sr]Seems I knew little about emotions.
[k]

＠Siegfried
No, more than anything else[line 2]since I was asked to,[sr]I believed nothing else could have been done.
[k]

＠Siegfried
I showed excessive lack of interest in everything.
[k]

＠Hagen
You neglected your life, your hope, and most of all your desires.
[k]

＠Hagen
You may have been fine with that, but you should've[sr]noticed those around you couldn't bear it.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Siegfried
...Yeah.
[k]

＠Hagen
Then, let me ask you.[sr][line 2]Do you have any wish as you are now?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Siegfried
I do. I had decided this from before. In this second[sr]life[line 2] I'll protect justice, and be proud of it.
[k]

＠Siegfried
I care not about the opinions of others.[sr]I merely wish that "I myself want to be as such."
[k]

＠Siegfried
My dream is[line 4]to be a hero of justice.
[k]

＠Hagen
...Hmph, such a childish dream, much like you.[sr]But that is fine.
[k]

＠Hagen
I will entrust the Rheingold to you.[sr]I'm sure you'll be able to deal with it properly[line 4]

Master, this is what I couldn't tell you earlier.[sr]I neglected myself too much, and ended up causing tragedy.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Siegfried
I will not repeat my mistake again.[sr]I want to become a hero of justice and prevent it.
[k]

＠Siegfried
Is it absurd...[sr]to wish for that?
[k]

？1：Not at all.

？2：It is not absurd.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Siegfried
...Thank you Master.[sr]I give you my best regards for the future.
