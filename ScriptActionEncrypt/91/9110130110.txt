[line 2]So nostalgic.

＠Caesar
It's easy to end with just that one phrase,[sr]but I don't do that. Do you know why?

Senpai, you can understand the idea behind his words.[sr]But I...

[charaFace D 1]
＠Caesar
I achieved valor in Gaul and Britannia.[sr]That is a fact, and it was written down as well.
[k]

＠Caesar
I guess you could say that I was young.[sr]But, that was not all.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Caesar
I escaped. It felt slightly better to preoccupy myself[sr]with service by sword than the schemes surging through Rome.
[k]

＠Caesar
Betrayal for betrayal, conspiracy for conspiracy.[sr]It's easy for me to climb the ladder of power as such.
[k]

＠Caesar
After all[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Caesar
I am a descendant of the goddess of love and beauty,[sr]and a man who fathered a child with a female fairy.
[k]

＠Caesar
My beauty makes women fall into my hands at will.[sr]Add in my intelligence and I'm the best at scheming.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Caesar
But...

[k]

？1：Beauty?

？！

＠Fou
Fou.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Caesar
Actually, scheming takes quite a bit of courage.[sr]At first you feel nothing, but gradually. Gradually.
[k]

＠Caesar
While I bite into juicy grapes, while I fool around with women, political enemies die off by my schemes[line 2]
[k]

＠Caesar
But when it's being repeated over and over, you start to feel sick, as if something's been tainted.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Caesar
That is why, at times, I escaped to the battlefield.

[charaFadein A 0.1 2]
＠Mash
...I now finally understand.[sr]Gaius Julius Caesar.
[k]

＠Mash
You seek to settle all the escaping you did right here and right now.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Caesar
That's right. I[line 2]wait, enemies.[sr]They must have noticed us.

Enemy signatures are approaching![sr]Is this like, remnants of the United Empire army?
[k]

Rome should be correcting itself now, so why are there United Empire soldiers still left?

I'll tell you later. Before that[sr][%1], hurry up and drive them off.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Caesar
I will take command for you.[sr]I am a great commander.
[k]

？1：Caesar, you fight too!

？2：You're a Saber and you're hanging back?

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Caesar
Saber, right, Saber. Saber.[sr]By rights I shouldn't even be in the Saber class.
[k]

＠Caesar
...I only unsheathe my sword when I'm next to a beauty.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Why look at me...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Caesar
Not knowing your own beauty is equal to a crime, yes?[sr]Well anyways, I shall unsheathe my sword.[sr]Oh, brother[line 2]
