...I can't see anything.
[k]

＠
Black. Dark. Lightless. There was only a sinking sensation, like I'd fallen into somewhere very, very deep.
[k]

＠
Or is there nothing there to see? I don't know.[sr]I can't even tell whether my eyes are open.
[k]

＠
Where am I? I don't know. Am I standing or sitting?
[k]

＠
I try to speak. My lips don't move. My tongue doesn't move. No sound comes from my throat.
[k]

＠
Ah. Am I in a bad situation?
[k]

＠
My body does feel heavy...
[k]

＠???
Looks like you have fallen deep.
[k]

＠???
But yes. It's probably why it was you of all people.

Welcome, [%1]. Welcome to the deep place where all sorts of carcasses fall, sink, and remain.

＠???
...Hmph. What's with that look?[sr]Those lost puppy eyes are a waste of time with me.
[k]

＠???
Of course, time is meaningless.[sr]At least in a place like this.
[k]

？1：...Are you by chance...?

？！

＠???
Do you know me?[sr]No. It can't be. You know nothing.
[k]

＠???
Don't you get it, Master?[sr][%1].

[charaFace A 5]
＠???
I have come from a place far beyond love and hatred. And so, I am somewhat...different from the version of me you know.

＠???
...All right. They'll be here soon.
[k]

＠???
You must leave this place. I am the one who shall burn away the remnants of darkness festering here.
[k]

＠???
My flames shall scorch your self and soul, and I cannot guarantee your safety.

[charaFace A 4]
＠???
Forgive me. You do not belong in a place like this.
[k]

？1：I don't want to.
？2：I don't know what's going on, but I can't leave you alone.

？！
