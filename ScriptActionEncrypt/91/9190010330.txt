But the other part is, of course,[sr]thanks to my friends and my Master.

＠Jeanne
They console me when I'm powerless to do something,[sr]and pick me up when I slump in defeat.

＠Jeanne
That's all the salvation I need.

＠Jeanne
I may not have been saved in history,[sr]but I know their desire to help me is genuine.
