Lastly, a word about what it means to be a Master.[sr]I'll tell you how to get along with your Servants.

What are you talking about?[sr]I'm here lecturing because the people at Chaldea won't.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Emiya
I heard how you became a Master, [%1].
[k]

＠Emiya
You're no Mage, and you have no experience.[sr]You became a Master by accident, yes?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Emiya
Even if no one else can do your job, that's still absurd.[sr]I should at least teach you how to act like a Master.

＠Emiya
Enough. We're talking about Servants.[sr]They are Heroic Spirits from many different eras.
[k]

＠Emiya
Basically, a Servant will be more powerful[sr]than their Master. You understand that?

＠Mash
Yes.[sr]No one needs a familiar weaker than they are.
[k]

＠Emiya
Correct. But it's wrong for a Master to[sr]unduly respect or fear their Servant.
[k]

＠Emiya
They have achieved great things, but within the confines of the contract, that means nothing.
[k]

＠Emiya
The Master and Servant relationship is defined by the contract, but mentally it's best for them to be equals.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Emiya
Listen. Even a godlike Servant[sr]got their start the same way as you.
[k]

＠Emiya
Anyone who lives in the modern era, uses the wisdom their ancestors left behind[line 3]
[k]

＠Emiya
Servants are no different.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Emiya
Even Heroic Spirits achieved deeds with the help of others when they were alive, and that's why they choose to contract with you.
[k]

＠Emiya
In other words, being summoned and relied on isn't necessarily a bad thing for a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Emiya
For example, how would you feel if something you left behind could aid the people of the next era?
[k]

？1：...That would be kind of nice.

？2：It would feel like the proof that I lived.

？！

[charaFace D 6]
＠Emiya
That's right.[sr]Servants feel the same way.
[k]

＠Emiya
The deeds you did, the things you left behind nurtures[sr]the next generation[line 3]All Servants take pride in that.
[k]

＠Emiya
Doesn't matter if the Servant is good or evil.[sr]Servants and Masters are mentally equal.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Emiya
A Servant aiding a Master, is simply a matter of duty.
[k]

＠Emiya
That is what it means to live on this planet.[sr]What you do will surely help someone in the future.
[k]

＠Mash
...Someone in the future...
