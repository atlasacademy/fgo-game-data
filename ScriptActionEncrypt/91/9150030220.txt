Master... I'm sorry.[sr]You've caught me at an embarrassing moment.

[charaFace C 4]

Actually... No, I'm sure you've already noticed. It's about my body.

？！

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I'm sure even Shieldy's noticed,[sr]but lately, I've been slowing you down.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
What did you do, Senpai?![sr]...Wait, slowing us down? You, Tamamo?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Indeed... You see, for some reason, I cannot fully use my powers.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
It doesn't feel like you're holding back...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
No, I can feel that I am.[sr]It's my body, after all.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
A long time ago, you see, I had nine fluffy tails and would go around...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...causing havoc everywhere.[sr]The follies of youth, you understand[line 2]
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I'll spare you the details, but eventually I became deeply, deeply repentant.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I sealed away eight of my evil tails...[sr]and became a weak, one-tailed fox.

The famous story of the nine-tailed fox. I've never heard that she lost her tails, though.

I'd like to be stronger so that I can be of use to you, Master, but...

Is there a problem?
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Yes, when I get stronger, I get more tails. But you see...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
When I get more tails, I become a very different sort of creature than I am now...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Yes, I kind of... I become a great demon strong enough to destroy the multiverse.

Yes. Understand that this isn't an exaggeration. I become a great demon...

...that is an avatar of the apocalypse itself.
[k]

？1：I see...

？2：But should I care?

？！

[charaFace C 4]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
The thought of you seeing me like that makes me scared to grow more tails...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
But if I can't be useful to you, I'm just a fluffy fox, shrine maiden...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...and the cause of this Holy Grail War is a threat enough to rival my nine-tail self...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I'm not sure what to do.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

A battle with your past, huh?

Aah, I hate myself for having so much hidden power!

？1：Even with more tails, aren't you still Tamamo?

？2：Really, it doesn't bother me.

I know, I know...[sr]You're just about to get sick of m... MIKON!?

M-Master!?[sr]W-What did you say?
[k]

？1：Seriously, I don't care.

？2：You'll always be Tamamo.

？！

[charaFace C 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
What!? So Master, even if I get all nine tails back, and even if I think...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
“Wow, this is ridiculous,” you'll still treat me like you did before?
[k]

？1：Yup.

？2：Yeah.

？！

[charaFace C 3]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I can't believe it! I came to this world by pure chance, and to think the Master I've contracted with out of some sense of fate...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...Would possess such a handsome soul! Oh, but it's not as good as the man I'm destined to be with.

Okay, now I'm really fired up![sr]I'm even more serious about this! Yeah!
