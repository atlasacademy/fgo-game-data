Adventures like looking for pirate treasures[sr]are part of what makes humans "romantic."

Just before Kidd was caught, he told[sr]a fellow pirate the whereabouts of his treasure.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mary
But he was a pirate, you know?[sr]Stories you hear from a drunk aren't all that trustworthy.
[k]

＠Mary
So nobody ever found[sr]where Captain Kidd's treasure lay.

How do you know where it is, Mary?

Oh, I found out later the[sr]treasure I previously gave up on belonged to Captain Kidd.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
You gave up on it?

＠Mary
By chance, I ended up on this island[sr]a little before I became a pirate.

Since I was here, I decided to look around[line 2][sr]and I found the treasure.
