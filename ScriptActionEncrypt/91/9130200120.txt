＠Altria
...Well then, Master.[sr]Why do you come to a place like this?
[k]

＠Altria
This is the world of my memories.[sr]Have you too come to expose my identity?
[k]

？1：That's not my intent.
？2：It's all Merlin's doing.

？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠Altria
...Merlin?[sr]Oh...I see. So that's how it is...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Altria
But you bear some responsibility as well.[sr]You fell prey too easily to Merlin's cajolery.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Altria
If we had not formed a contract, you would already be dead. Exercise more caution in the future.
[k]

＠Altria
I differ from other Servants. It is not necessary for you to understand me.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Altria
You only need to give me orders to fight. Everything else is inconsequential. Especially “mutual understanding.”
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Altria
...Mutual understanding. Surely no such thing could exist between a human and me.
[k]

？1：Why is that?
？2：Even though we're talking right now?

？！


＠Altria
There is no reason.[sr]I am not the King Arthur you know.
[k]

＠Altria
By bearing the sacred lance for too long, I became a Heroic Spirit with a Heaven attribute, rather than one of Humans or Earth.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Altria
...From your perspective, my vantage point is commensurate with a god's.
[k]

＠Altria
So...I myself can no longer understand what is human warmth or laughter.
[k]

＠Altria
What I consider “good” and what you consider “good” are surely different.
[k]

＠Altria
I...am arrogant as I am merciless.[sr]You no doubt noticed during the last battle.
[k]

＠Altria
I punish what I cannot forgive.[sr]I obtain what is valuable through force.
[k]

＠Altria
I have not a shadow of a doubt that my way is just.[sr]I suppose you could say I am a tyrant.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Altria
Thus...
[k]

＠Altria
If I were to enter your circle, I would trample the flowers of your human joy.
[k]

＠Altria
My former self would have been loath to do such a thing.
[k]

＠Altria
Perhaps I no longer understand such feelings, but I do not want to ruin the joy of others.
[k]

？1：Aren't you overthinking things?

[charaFace A 0]

＠Altria
No. This is the truth, pure and unvarnished.
[k]

＠Altria
What lies beyond is the Lion King you all have fought.
[k]

？2：So I guess we fought a Lion Queen, not a Lion King...

[charaFace A 3]

＠Altria
What? Ah, I suppose a female king is in fact a “queen”...
[k]

＠Altria
I just don't like the sound of it. Am I uneasy because that hits a little too close to home...?
[k]

？！

[charaTalk C]


＠???
...The vantage point of a god.[sr]I see. Such is the anguish of someone with power.
[k]

＠???
God neither saves nor forgives people.
[k]

＠???
God is the law, the nation, the world. Such an order collapses in the presence of human warmth.
[k]

＠Romulus
One who became a divine Heroic Spirit at the end of your path for protection. Do not fear, do not fear...
[k]

＠Romulus
My name is Romulus. Like you, I was worshipped as a god while I continued to walk the earth.
[k]

＠Romulus
The shining emperor. The noble lance. The great tree soaring into the heavens. That is me, this is Rome!
[k]

？1：Romulus, the Holy Progenitor!
？2：He's glimmering!?

？！

[charaFace F 4]

＠Romulus
Indeed, good words.[sr]Fit for worshipping a god. Thus...

＠Romulus
You're not aware? A rightful person cannot endure the light of the sacred lance.
[k]

＠Romulus
Perhaps you require an evil Master. One day, that person will go blind, heart gone cold, and become a mindless puppet who worships you.
[k]

＠Romulus
You have no need for voices with a heart.[sr]Nor do you have need for a heart.
[k]

＠Romulus
Deus Ex Machina. Goddess of the Sacred Lance.[sr]Return to your proper form.
[k]

＠Romulus
That is why Rome journeyed forth.[sr]To eliminate [%1], your Master.

＠Altria
Mind your own business, Founder Romulus! I show no mercy to those who try to lay a hand on my Master!
