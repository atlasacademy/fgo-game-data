I'll admit I was a bit worried when you broke out the runic flame, but I'm glad to see you have returned to your former sharpness! Ho ho ho.

That is as it should be.[sr]Your spear is free of uncertainty.

Brynhild. My sister.

Live in beauty, battle maiden.[sr]Please, don't go around looking so forlorn.

＠Altera Santa
Hold your head up high. You and the others may have met tragic ends in myth, but I think THAT is what makes you so beautiful.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I am sure you lived a full life. If I close my eyes, I can see you so clearly, running across grassy plains.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
So please...please don't feel so ashamed.

＠Altera Santa
So when you have a problem, don't be afraid to[sr]ask for help. There is nothing wrong with that.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I promise you, our Master, and the rest of Chaldea, are more than strong enough to accommodate any difficulties that Servants may be having.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
[&He:She] won't crumble beneath the weight if some of us must lean on [&him:her] for support. Right, Master?
[k]

？1：You know it!
？2：I could handle a hundred of you, easy.

Otherwise, when your beloved makes his way to Chaldea one day...you might not be able to make full use of your spear.

And that would be a terrible waste, wouldn't it?
