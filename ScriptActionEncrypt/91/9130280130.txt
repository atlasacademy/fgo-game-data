[charaFace A 2]

＠Jaguar Warrior
The city of night, steeped in desires...it's like a mini-map of someone's life with no possible escape!
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
And it was here that we received intel that there are children who wander around at night...
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
To pursue the truth, we head to the Amazon[line 2]I mean, to the city at night.

And the nail in the coffin: wearing a full-body leotard is definitely a sign of rebellion! He is pawsitively a shameless delinquent!

Ah...but I understand. It's not all your fault. The adults who never disciplined you are partly responsible fur your behavior. Oh, and Scáthach.
