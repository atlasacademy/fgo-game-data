＠Jeanne
Seventeen years living in that village.[sr]Seventeen years with my family.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Peaceful days spent helping out my parents and praying at the church. A precious time in my life.
[k]

＠Jeanne
...But I threw it all away.[sr]I left it all behind for the sake of victory.

It appears we are on a deserted island.[sr]Well, not deserted now that we are here.

Master. I believe I am to blame for this. I'm very sorry for causing you trouble in such a busy time...
[k]

？1：Don't worry about it.
？！


＠Jeanne
...[charaFace A 0]Thank you very much, Master.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Jeanne
As for our present situation... It seems there is nothing on this island.
[k]

＠Jeanne
It is small. I do not sense anything demonic...[sr]But there are no caves, and nothing man-made either.
[k]


？1：Which means...?
？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Jeanne
It appears that we are inside a dream, like last time.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Jeanne
And there is one more thing that I have noticed:[sr]this time around, we are not in a place from my memory.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Jeanne
...I'm embarrassed to say this, but I'm at my wits' end.
[k]

＠Jeanne
What shall we do...?

See!? There's a ship.[sr]It looks like it is coming towards us...

...[charaFace A 5]I sense very strong magical energy coming from that ship. Something is definitely up.
[k]

？1：What do you mean?

＠Jeanne
Based on the situation, it's likely some torment from my past, like last time.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Jeanne
...But the theme this time around is strange.
[k]

＠Jeanne
I may have seen the sea,[sr]but I've never been aboard a ship...
[k]

[branch select04_end]

？2：Should we ignore it?

[branch select04_02]

？！

[label select04_02]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Jeanne
Well, as we are alone on an island in the middle of the ocean, getting passage on that ship would seem to be our only choice.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Jeanne
Um...unless you are saying that you want to enjoy a leisurely vacation on a deserted island, Master...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Jeanne
In which case, I will do my best to make that happen!
[k]

？1：No, please! That's not it!
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Jeanne
Hehe. I know.
[k]

？！

[label select04_end]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Jeanne
Our only problem is that it's unclear what kind of people are aboard the ship. If only they were pirates, it would be easy...
[k]


？1：Easy?
？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Jeanne
Yes, if I take it on myself to discipline...I mean, persuade them, I'm sure they will listen to us.
[k]

＠Jeanne
...Master. Something's coming.

There doesn't seem to be anyone on that larger ship, though... Things just keep getting stranger...

Oh, Master![sr]Please be careful as you board!
