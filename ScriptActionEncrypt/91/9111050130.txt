These woods smell rotten.[sr]But I won't stop now.
[k]

＠
I will kill that Demonic Beast.[sr]I won't rest until I find it.
[k]

＠
...Why do I hate it so much?[sr]Why...?
[k]

＠
Because it reminds me of myself.
[k]

＠
I'm sure it never asked to be born.[sr]I'm sure it never wanted to kill.
[k]

＠
But at some point, that Demonic[sr]Beast lost sight of who it was.
[k]

＠
At some point, it stopped being a Demonic[sr]Beast and instead became a monster.
[k]

＠
No beast should ever cross that line.
[k]

＠
...I remember the fight to the death[sr]that took place here in Shinjuku.
[k]

＠
I went from beast to Demonic Beast,[sr]and from Demonic Beast to monster.
[k]

＠
I tried to stay a beast at heart, but I ended up consumed by the fires of vengeance burning within me.
[k]

＠
...That's right.
[k]

＠
I was already a monster when[sr]I answered Moriarty's summons.
[k]

＠
And ever since the Age of Myth, there has only[sr]been one possible ending to a monster's story.
[k]

＠
It wreaks havoc on its surroundings,[sr]and dies afraid and regretful.
[k]

＠
Well, not today. Today, I'm going to finish that Demonic Beast before it can complete its transformation into a monster.
[k]

＠
...There it is.
