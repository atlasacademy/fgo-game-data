Now we all share a connection, whether we like it or not. And we didn't just fight once in Tokyo. We fought there twice.

Pharaoh Ozymandias never speaks of the battles[sr]he's fought, even those from when he lived...

Not about his parting with the holy man,[sr]nor his glorious battle against the Hittites...

I get it, really. I don't like to talk about my own battles unless it's absolutely necessary either.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arash
...But I guess if we're talking about who he meant by “hero” then I guess this is one of those times.
[k]

＠Arash
Someone who accomplished something amazing while he still lived? A great man who was around at the same time the pharaoh guy was?
[k]

＠Arash
That might be the case for the first hero,[sr]but I'm pretty sure it's not for the second.
[k]

？1：...What about someone he fought?
？2：So, someone strong enough for Ozymandias to respect?

I figured we'd have a good chance of finding him here,[sr]but I guess he's not as sentimental as I thought.
