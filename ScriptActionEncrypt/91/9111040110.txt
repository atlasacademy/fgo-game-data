？1：(Something's touching my cheek...)
？！

I felt something that was both cold and warm...[sr]Something between hard and soft...
[k]

＠
It felt...rough...
[k]

？1：(Something is grasping my finger...)
？！

＠
It felt like a bottomless chasm...just waiting to swallow me whole...
[k]

＠
It felt damp...
[k]

＠???
How boring...
[k]

＠???
Ah, now it's crying out saying it can wait no longer. My hair...my evil...is shamelessly driveling...
[k]

＠???
If you do not wake up soon,[sr]I may really eat you...

...Hmph. So you have awoken.[sr]That was a close call for you.
[k]

？1：There are scale marks on my cheek!?
？2：There's a snake chewing on my finger!?
？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Gorgon
If you're disappointed that I spared[sr]your life rather than relieved...
[k]

＠Gorgon
...then tell me that you lament having missed the opportunity to merge with me and melt into sweet oblivion.
[k]

＠Gorgon
It's not too late to speak up.[sr]Don't you fret. I am always hungry.
[k]

？1：Oh, no, no, no...no. Don't worry about me.
？2：Oh, uh, thanks, but I'm...fine...
？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Gorgon
Mmm. What...is this place?
[k]

＠Gorgon
I just found myself here with you sleeping beside me. You're my Master. Do you know what is happening?
[k]

？1：This has happened to me a few times...
？2：Probably a dream, or your unconscious or something...
？！

＠Gorgon
...? What do you mean? Explain more in detail.

＠Gorgon
Hehe...hahahaha![sr]A dream. A dream? Of mine!? Oh you ARE funny...
[k]

？1：That's...funny?
？！

＠Gorgon
Of course it is. Look around you.[sr]See this cold, empty world.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Gorgon
It's so dark... Not a mote of light to be seen,[sr]nor a sign of life anywhere.
[k]

＠Gorgon
Your lungs are filled with dark and ominous air.[sr]What dread sights you can see are most sinister.
[k]

＠Gorgon
The cold floor is damp, like a demon's entrails,[sr]and eagerly awaits you to collapse and die...
[k]

＠Gorgon
Its hideous walls stifle you,[sr]waiting to close around you like a coffin.
[k]

＠Gorgon
There is nothing at all good here. A true nightmare for any human. A being of pure despair and evil...that is what I am.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Gorgon
Ah... This place is a true reflection of my nature...utterly monstrous!
[k]

＠Gorgon
I certainly could not argue if you said this was a reflection of who I am within. All I can do is laugh at this! Hahahaha!
[k]

？1：You're talking nonsense again...
？2：Maybe there's a field of flowers over there...
？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠Gorgon
... I've always wondered.[sr]What do you think of me, truly?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Gorgon
Now more than ever, you fail to understand my nature, which makes this a good opportunity to teach you.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Gorgon
I am...evil. That is all.
[k]

＠Gorgon
The third sister of a certain family, destined to become a monster. That is all I am.
[k]

＠Gorgon
As my power goes beyond any mere common evil,[sr]some may even call me the mother of Demonic Beasts.
[k]

＠Gorgon
Yet you do not fear me... Why?
[k]

？1：We don't have any trouble communicating...
？2：You seem to understand what I say...
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Gorgon
...If communication is all you require, your bar is quite...low.
[k]

＠Gorgon
And even that is only possible because, at this moment, I exist in a state between my forms as a goddess and monster.
[k]

＠Gorgon
I honestly do not understand why I was summoned in this state...
[k]

＠Gorgon
Let me make myself clear. I am not a goddess.[sr]I am a monster. I am a divinity who turned evil.
[k]

＠Gorgon
That's why you[line 2]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_3 0.1]

＠Gorgon
Hah... I am the mother of Demonic Beasts. I devour even other evils. It would not surprise me to know there are a few lurking within me.
[k]

＠Gorgon
At least it may be amusing to watch whatever hungry beasts lurk here devour you.
[k]

？1：I'd appreciate it if you'd help me out...
？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Gorgon
Shut up. I don't care what you want.
[k]

＠Gorgon
But... I have no intention of feeding the other evils that work within me in this dream of mine.
[k]

＠Gorgon
Letting them feast on your flesh would be a waste.[sr]Besides, I happen to feel like exercising just now.
[k]


＠Gorgon
Consider yourself lucky.[sr]You can cower before me once we finish here.
[k]

＠Gorgon
Now, look upon my form and learn...
[k]

＠Gorgon
Learn that the being you thought you could merely talk with is a monster who will turn your stomach!
[k]
