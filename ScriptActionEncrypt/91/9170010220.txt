You know Berserker... I told you about it[sr]before, right? Heracles's madness is...

It's not a true "Madness Enhancement."[sr]He can be even more powerful...

a way out of this predicament...

＠Dr. Roman
Like I told you before, in order to power up a Heroic Spirit like Heracles using Madness Enhancement,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
we need an incredible amount of magical energy...[sr]So much is needed, that it would kill an ordinary mage.

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Besides, there're many tales of Heracles in his madness. What's more, every time he's enraged, some tragedy occurs as well.

It's easy to accomplish. You simply need to pray for it. You just need to change the original summon chant a little.
