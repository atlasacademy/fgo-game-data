＠Mata Hari
So, the King is the last, huh?[sr]Well, let's give him a good spanking first.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
Then, I'll extract the information for you.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
But...he's the king of a country.[sr]Can you do anything?

＠Mata Hari
What're you talking about, cute little Mash?[sr]From my experience, kings are the easiest to handle.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Mata Hari
I mean, kings are at the top of their nations, right?[sr]So, they need comfort more than anyone in their nations.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Mata Hari
If anyone doesn't want that, then it must be a king[sr]who sacrifices everything for his people...or for God.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
Otherwise, he's a tyrant who understands[sr]that it's the people who make all the sacrifices.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Mata Hari
If he's an ordinary king, then no problem.[sr]Well, let's fight.

W-Who are you people!?[sr]Stand back!

No, pardon us but we'd like your assistance in an[sr]investigation. We also can't deny this is rather forceful.

You bastards...![sr]K-Kill, I'm going to kill you[line 2]!
