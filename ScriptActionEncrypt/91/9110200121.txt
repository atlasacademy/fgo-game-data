Just as dawn will always break the dark of night,[sr]so too must a storm end.
[k]

＠Altria
I am merely a remnant. Were this not the end of the world, I might simply have made a mark on history and disappeared.

Stop right there, Knight of the Round Table.[sr]I am not the king you know.
[k]

＠Altria
This shining sacred spear is all that allows me to exist as a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Altria
Even so, I am no more than a remnant of that person. There is no need for you to bow to me.

Well, I didn't come to my senses.[sr]It is only that I have remembered something.
[k]

＠Altria
The plains that I remembered are long gone,[sr]as are the people we vowed to protect.
[k]

＠Altria
But I still sense something. There are some human activity that has rooted itself in this city.

Traces of the dream of a utopia... A dream that existed here long ago, and still exists today...

If it wasn't for the guidance of the playwright, I might not have known what to feel in the face of this fate of mine.

Hahahahaha, of course not!

＠Shakespeare
I could never have summoned such a perfect likeness of the King of Knights!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Shakespeare
Well, to think that she would manifest as a remnant, destroy London, and then simply disappear...
[k]

＠Shakespeare
...would be a nightmare.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
And so I felt compelled to bring the most capable of all knights to this place.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Shakespeare
Ah, 'tis passing strange... These dreams of mine are no sooner formed than forgotten.
[k]

？1：Good eye!

Thank you, Master.

Ah, to be referred to as such embarrasses me.

[charaFace A 0]

＠Lancelot
In any case, I will accept your praise with pride!

Thank you. I shall cherish those words forever.

No matter the dire situation I face,[sr]those words will give me strength.

＠Shakespeare
I must be honest. To think that the most capable knight is FRENCH is more than a little troubling.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Fortunately, modern man that I am, I consider myself to be quite open-minded when considering a nation's troubles.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Shakespeare
So even though the critics of your country first called me “vulgar” and “cruel”...
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Shakespeare
I offer my forgiveness now!

＠Shakespeare
Well, at least in modern France, people know my true worth, so all is well...

But know this: an author carries his grudges forever!

＠Lancelot
It's nothing. I just remembered somebody...a dependable mage who has a deplorable tendency toward the ridiculous as well.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Lancelot
If his hand is at work here, there's nothing for it. Annoying as it is, I can only accept it.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Lancelot
After all, he is sneaky as a snake in the grass.
[k]

＠Lancelot
Only our king could ever command that man.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Lancelot
...I see.[sr]He WOULD do something like this...

Hopefully all that annoying stuff is done.

And so, thanks to the Knight of the Lake, the remnant of the King of Storms in London vanished...
[k]

＠???
And now his debt to the Round Table is paid in full.

＠???
Yep. All's right in the world.[sr]Happily ever after for everyone.
