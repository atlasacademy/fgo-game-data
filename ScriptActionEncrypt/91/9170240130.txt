(Huff...huff...) This is nothing...[sr]It's just a flesh wound...

It'll take more than just a little battle[sr]to the death against the Savage Queen...

Deep in the heart of enemy territory as we are, I guess it's no surprise. Plus, we got separated from our team.

Your injuries are very serious too. We need to hurry and find you somewhere safe to recover.
