Hmm, well this won't do.[sr]Maybe I have had a little too much to drink.

＠Iskandar
Not sure if it was the oni wine or the sweet Celtic mead, but whatever it was, it must have been powerful stuff indeed to make me back down from a fight...

＠Medb
No way! You always make guys you like literally spill their guts for you? That's awesome!
[k]

＠Medb
I could never do that myself, and I wouldn't want to anyway since it'd make them worthless as soldiers, but that's definitely one way to make a guy literally fall for you!

You've got a little bit of an oni in you, don't you, sweetie? Fairy blood, you say? Iiinteresting...

I'm not sure what happened during the battle, but they seem to be having a lively conversation now...

？1：This is the scariest girl talk I've ever heard.
？2：I guess...it just goes to show the power of having things in common?
？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Mash
Yes. It may look like they've[sr]reached an understanding...
[k]

＠Mash
...but I also get the feeling they could go right back into a fight to the death at the drop of a hat.
[k]

＠Mash
I suppose it reflects well on[sr]how open-minded they both are...

...Hmm, Is that so? That sounds kind of intriguing. Can't remember the last time someone entertained me instead of the other way around.

In that case...

Hehe, don't underestimate the power of royalty.

＠Medb
Of course the people I choose to requisition from are going to cry tears of joy and celebrate this day for the rest of their lives, like a second birthday.

[charaFace A 14]
＠Medb
Anyway, that takes care of the first item: wine with high magical energy affinity. Excellent wine at that since it's basically her purified magical energy!

[charaFace A 6]
＠Medb
Now, let's go requisition the next item!
