＠Jack
...Hey, Mommy.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Jack
If another Jack is[line 2]stronger than us,[sr]what are you going to do?
[k]

＠Jack
Are you going to dump us?
[k]

？1：No, I would never do that to you.

？2：Strength doesn't matter.

？！

＠Jack
...Are you sure?[sr]But isn't that exactly how the Holy Grail War works?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Jack
It isn't?[sr]...Hm, okay. I'm wrong then.
[k]

＠Jack
You're a weird person, Mommy.[sr]Of course it's better to be stronger.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Jack
You think so, too, don't you?

＠Mash
No, Jack.[sr]Neither Master nor I think that way.
[k]

＠Mash
If we are to discuss being strong or weak, perhaps all[sr]of us are weak against our opponents.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Of course, it'd be better if we were stronger.[sr]But strength alone will not help us fight it out from here.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
I believe what we need is mutual trust.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
We fight with faith in our Master,[sr]and Master fights having faith in us.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Jack
...What a strange person you are. I have never[sr]met someone who would say things like that.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Oh...really?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Jack
But, sure, I like the way you think.[sr]Look, the last Jack is right there.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Jack
I'm sure he's much stronger than us.[sr]Much wiser, much more vicious, and much more terrible.
[k]

＠Jack
I'm sure that one is the real Jack the Ripper.
[k]

＠Jack
The manifestation of everyone's fantasies[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Jack
We might be nothing more than a monster[sr]who took advantage of that.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Jack
...If you can still accept us,[sr]we'll do what we can do. For your sake, Mommy.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Jack
...Yeah, let's do it!
