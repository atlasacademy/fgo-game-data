Forgive me, everyone.[sr]I should have been more considerate.

I thought calculations were unnecessary for battles between brutes, and thus neglected to predict this future...

＠Xiang Yu
Of course, my beloved is not a brute, but a delicate lady. Given her mild temperament, I should have known this would happen, even without foresight...

As you know, the circumstances of her[sr]summoning were somewhat...unusual.

I am sure she will continue to behave poorly as a result, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive her...

Oh, that reminds me, Master. While we are here,[sr]let me pay you back for this past week.

＠Xiang Yu
Four yakisoba bread, three magazines, other miscellaneous expenses... That's two point seven million QP altogether. Here you go.

You may be a Master dealing with[sr]one of your Servants, but even so...
[k]

＠Prince of Lan Ling
...if you're going to engage in trade with someone unfamiliar with fair market prices, isn't it only right that you not take advantage of them?
[k]

？1：Well, uh, he said he wanted to reward me for my help, so...
？2：He said it was the least he could do, and it sort of spiraled from there...

It looks like you still have all the receipts, so we can go over them and return the extra QP to Xiang Yu.

Have Yu Mei-ren give it back to him instead. Maybe seeing how much her man's been spending on her will embarrass the bitchiness out of her.

I strongly. Discourage that. Course of action. Even if. She did. Cause this situation. Herself. Such a gesture. Would be too. Provocative. She might. Change. Her class to Avenger. As a response. To that.

We'll have to be patient and let her gradually get used to life as a Chaldean Servant on her own terms.
