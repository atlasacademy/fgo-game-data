＠Vlad III
It's done.[sr]My friend, are you safe?
[k]

？1：Of course.

[charaFace A 3]

＠Vlad III
Ah, you are so dependable! I am impressed that you are untroubled after witnessing one of my battles!
[k]

？2：Lord Vlad, are you okay?

[charaFace A 3]

＠Vlad III
Of course. I cannot allow my friend to see me bleed.[sr]I must confess that last enemy did a number on me, though.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Vlad III
But honestly, this city is quite vexing.
[k]

＠Vlad III
I hear it was once the site of a Holy Grail War, but does the Holy Grail War really bring about so much destruction to one place?
[k]

＠Vlad III
This sight is not of this world. Some other catastrophe must've led to this horrific calamity.

I noticed that too. It's hard to imagine even a Holy Grail going out of control could cause all this.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]

＠Dr. Roman
Well, the Greater Grail in Fuyuki was a ginormous Magical Reactor Core, so it's at least possible it could blow the whole city up.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But for it to keep burning like this...[sr]It doesn't make sense.

Are there other things we don't know? Did you come with us because there's something you sensed,[sr]Lord Vlad?

It wasn't for the expedition, as I've no experience or knowledge in such things. It's just that I do not care for the particular contamination in this Singularity.
[k]

＠Vlad III
There's something here. Something I loathe above all else. I'd hoped to find its source and destroy it...

Sorry. You're out of time. The Holy Grail has already been recovered from that Singularity.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You can't stay there long, I'm afraid. The surplus magical energy sent to Sheba is about to run out.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm sure this expedition leaves you unsatisfied,[sr]Lord Vlad, but can we have you all return right now?

Your spineless personality is deplorable, but your daily hard work and attention to detail are to be commended at least.
[k]

＠Vlad III
Ah, would that all humans were so diligent as you.[sr]Such could never be, sadly.

Welcome back, [%1].[sr]Where's Lord Vlad? Ah...he's back in standby mode.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Dr. Roman
But I never imagined a Servant like him would point out the problem of Fuyuki.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Dr. Roman
Looking back into Fuyuki is on our to-do list,[sr]but the next Singularity takes priority.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Dr. Roman
After all, we are approaching the Seventh Singularity in Uruk, during the Age of Gods. Everyone will have to work their butts off, or we won't make it...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Dr. Roman
Oh? Is something on your mind, [%1]? If I can be of help, I'm more than happy to lend an ear.
[k]

？1：...I just don't understand why Lord Vlad fights...
？2：I heard this story, once...

？！

＠Dr. Roman
...Hm. A Servant's dream...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You may be talking about the battle records that get engraved into their soul after they become Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But I don't think that's a sad story.[sr]He said “I would gladly burn in the fires of hell”...
[k]

[charaFace C 8]

＠Dr. Roman
He doesn't mean he wants to suffer again.[sr]I think he means he's just looking for some hope.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even if she had to do it for her survival, the woman in his story never chose to take the life of another.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Dr. Roman
It wasn't for her dignity or for her humanity...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Dr. Roman
Basically... One doesn't sacrifice the lives of others for their own protection or gain.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Obvious human kindness...the way a soul should be...was something he believed in. That goes for both past and present.
