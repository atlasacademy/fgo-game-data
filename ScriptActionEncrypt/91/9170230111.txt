＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Ah... Good morning, [%1].
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
It's a fine morning. I don't know what it's like outside, but it's a wonderful day for Rayshift.

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
What's wrong?[sr]Why are you staring at me like that...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Heh heh, your sleepy eyes are adorable, too.[sr]Breakfast is ready.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Mash helped out, too. She's a good girl.[sr]Nothing like those terrible insects.

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Oh, but listen to this. I couldn't believe it but... Kintoki helped out this morning, too!
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
My, my, look at him go... It's enough to make a mother shed tears of joy!
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Actually, I did shed a few...!
[k]

？1：If I am still alive, that means...
？2：I guess I was accepted?

？！

[charaFace G 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Yes?
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
What are you saying?[sr]I accepted you as my Master long ago.
[k]


？1：That was quite...
？2：...A fierce battle.

？！

[charaFace G 5]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I don't know what you mean...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
If I hadn't, I wouldn't be taking such good care of you. Didn't you realize that?
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Now then, go wash your face.[sr]I don't mind bringing you a basin and a towel.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...If you don't mind overprotectiveness, I won't hold back.
[k]


？1：In moderation, please!

？！

[charaFace G 1]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...Hee hee hee.
