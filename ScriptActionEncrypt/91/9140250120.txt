Good, good.[sr]I knew we were right to send you an invite.

[charaFace D 9]

＠D：[servantName 503400:Fluffy-Eared Caster:Queen of Sheba]
In that case, welcome to the[sr]Chaldea Merchants Association♪
[k]

＠Caesar
The economics club, if you will.
[k]

＠Caesar
This is where Chaldea's big earners[sr]come together to pool their resources.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Caesar
To control the flow of information is to control the economy itself. Now come, tip your wine glass, and let us exchange trade secrets.
[k]

＠Caesar
Here at Chaldea, small talk and business talk are lumped together into the same concept, losing their respective essence.
[k]


＠Caesar
What we choose to take, and choose to leave behind,[sr]is where our unique skillsets shine.
[k]



＠Caesar
We were, of course, certain that you would not be troubled by the gears of Chaldea's economy beginning to truly pick up speed...
[k]

＠Caesar
In fact, it is because we believe you are trustworthy enough to help us turn them yourself that you were invited to join us.
[k]

＠Caesar
That should be a source of great pride for you!

[k]

＠D：[servantName 503400:Fluffy-Eared Caster:Queen of Sheba]
In fact, I make new luxurious rooms[sr]every day just to keep things fresh!

＠D：[servantName 503400:Fluffy-Eared Caster:Queen of Sheba]
We're trying to be a real, respectable, legitimate merchant society, with no backstabbing or cheating whatsoever.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 503400:Fluffy-Eared Caster:Queen of Sheba]
In time, we're planning to make this a safe and secure place where merchants of all stripes can make a buck or ten without any money laundering, you know...?

Hm? Hahaha, is that all you're concerned about?[sr]Come now, no need to worry about titles here.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Caesar
I'm an autocrat myself, not a merchant, though I do have a talent for the latter. That holds just as true for Her Majesty here as well.
[k]

＠Caesar
This association is about a way of life! It's all about the thrill of financial endeavors pursued by the finer members of society.

[charaTalk B]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]

＠Columbus
Exactly. It's about a way of life.
[k]

＠Columbus
I've known plenty of merchants in my time, too. Bigshots who wield their guild's authority like a club, modest peddlers just trying to make a living, con artists who never met a mark they didn't like, patsies with the best of intentions and not a lick of common sense...
[k]

＠Columbus
So, believe me, I know what merchants[sr]value better than just about anyone.
[k]

＠Columbus
They want to minimize risk, and maximize reward.[sr]That's the case for you lot as well, right?

[charaFadein B 0.1 1]

＠Columbus
Heh. Well that's not me.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Columbus
Maximizing the reward is all that matters to me. Think I'd have made the journey out west if I'd spent a bunch of time weighing the risks?
[k]

＠Columbus
The only thing I was thinking about was the riches awaiting me if I could get there.
[k]

＠Columbus
It didn't matter how long it was gonna take or what I'd have to sacrifice along the way. I knew the reward would be enough to make up for all of that. Or rather, I believed it would.
[k]

＠Columbus
I really never bothered to weigh the expense of the voyage against the gold I'd gain.
[k]

＠Columbus
A merchant would never have set one foot on board a ship before drawing up an estimate. I never made one.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Columbus
That's why I have to refuse your offer.
[k]

＠Columbus
The whole idea of stopping your journey to take stock of the risks just doesn't sit right with me.

It's not that you won't calibrate your expectations, it's that you can't. You're a hedonistic gambling addict who's only got his eyes on the prize and ignores the risks entirely!
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Caesar
Indeed! That won't do. That won't do at all. One should never participate in a game you aren't certain you can win, whether by skill or other means.
[k]

＠Caesar
When the die is cast, whether literally or figuratively, one should always take steps to ensure that it lands the way they want.
[k]

＠Caesar
Of course, those measures can change depending on the scenario. Fair prices, an eloquent speech, a small army at your beck and call...
[k]

[charaFace D 7]

＠D：[servantName 503400:Fluffy-Eared Caster:Queen of Sheba]
I agree. This won't do at all.[sr]There are few things I despise more than gamblers.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 503400:Fluffy-Eared Caster:Queen of Sheba]
It's incredibly dangerous to have an actor in the marketplace who isn't concerned about what he might have to lose.
[k]

[charaFace D 19]

＠D：[servantName 503400:Fluffy-Eared Caster:Queen of Sheba]
His mere presence could disrupt my finely tuned calculations! And from there, it's only a hop, skip, and a jump to h-heavy losses! Oh God!

[charaFace D 15]

Why do you think I didn't think twice about sending him an invite? Can't you smell the scent of money practically radiating from him?

For better or worse, I can't help but think that where he goes, money follows.

If we let him run around doing whatever he wants, the consequences for Chaldea's economy could be disastrous.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 503400:Fluffy-Eared Caster:Queen of Sheba]
And that means we can't just ignore him.

[k]

＠D：[servantName 503400:Fluffy-Eared Caster:Queen of Sheba]

Please, allow me to offer you my assistance as the figurative king of cutting one's losses.
[k]

＠Caesar
Of course, if you like, I would also be happy to serve as his instructor myself.

＠Caesar
I could teach him all my proven methods for making money, from the Roman art of haggling to the Roman see-food diet.
