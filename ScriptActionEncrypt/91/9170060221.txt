[bgm BGM_EVENT_11 0.1]
＠Ibaraki-Douji
I didn't do anything wrong... I didn't even eat any of the humans who fled here from Uruk or whatever it was...
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
They didn't think they'd survive there...[sr]All I did was make them my minions for a while...
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
I was just...living my life... That's all...
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
With the weaklings... With those unknown deformed beasts... Together... That's all...
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
...Oh, but... Yeah, that's right.
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
For the longest time, it wasn't enough for me... It didn't matter that there were humans around or that those conniving beasts would slink over.
[k]


[charaFace B 5]
＠Ibaraki-Douji
There's nobody here. Do you understand?[sr]No one who knows me, or who talks to me...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Ibaraki-Douji
It wasn't long before the humans left. Said they were gonna check on Uruk[line 2]excuses like that[line 2]and just up and left.
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
None of them ever came back. I'm sure they died.
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
The deformed beasts are getting weaker by the day.[sr]Had they not been killed, they would've died out soon...
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
...They were all trembling with fear. They just treated me like a bonfire to huddle around for warmth.
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
But really, I was trembling just like them.
