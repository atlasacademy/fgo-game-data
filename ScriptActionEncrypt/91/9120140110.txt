＠Dr. Roman
While you can't attack outright, you've gotten much better at analyzing and adapting to the situation as it unfolds.

After all, your objective in battle is to sustain[sr]as little damage as possible. Never forget that.

Yes. I'm getting more confident[sr]on the defensive front.

＠Mash
When we were in Camelot, and I finally learned that the True Name of the Servant I fused with was Galahad...well, that has helped me so much...
[k]

＠Mash
The way I bear down...and instead of repelling the enemy's attack, it's like I ward them off, or even return the move...
[k]

？1：I get it. “Oaks may fall when reeds stand the storm.”

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
That's so eloquent, and it embodies the spirit of martial arts. That should be the motto for all Heroic Spirits.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Dr. Roman
No, it's not all about skill.[sr]Sometimes a defense must be unyielding as steel.
[k]

？2：The long-awaited counterattack...!

[charaFace A 3]

＠Mash
C-counter? Well, I hear Galahad[sr]was skilled at such things...
[k]

＠Mash
But I... It's still hard for me[sr]to read the enemy's movements...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Dr. Roman
If you're talking about a reversal technique, maybe aikido. Swordsmanship, karate...those types of martial arts all focus on responding to the enemy's moves.

I'll let the others make varied and exquisite dishes. Nobody can beat me when it comes to sheer quantity!

Actually, the rice that you cook is delicious,[sr]Touta. The grains come out so fluffy.

Legend says that you once defeated a giant centipede, Touta. I'd be very interested to see what it looked like!

Heh, cut it out. You're making me blush.[sr]I'm not used to so much praise, or talking about myself.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
But conveniently, there's this contraption that could help us out. I'd be happy to show you what you want to know.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mash
Are you going to show us how you[sr]defeated the giant centipede?
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
I'm always in favor of eating good rice. And no meal tastes better than the one you have after facing a life-or-death experience!

Now then, Lord Peach Hair. Give us the biggest centipede you have. I'll show you a proper bug hunt!

No, no. My own immaturity's got me[sr]riled up and now I can't calm down.

＠Tawara Touta
But you know what, Mash, [%1]. Even if we don't exactly have what we want, it's just a matter of improvisation.

＠Tawara Touta
I may have been blessed with many things during my lifetime, but that doesn't mean I had everything.

Rather, working around a situation like that is my forte. And, Lord Peachtree, if you don't mind a small request...
