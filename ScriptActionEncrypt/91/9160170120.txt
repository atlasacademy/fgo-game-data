...I'll admit, I do regret my actions a little bit.[sr]Not knowing anything can be quite a scary thing.

But, I will say this. Master, if you ever make a[sr]mockery of my foolishness, it's the Iron Maiden for you.

Mere phantom of this castle... You weakest of the weak,[sr]lowest of the low! How dare you stand before me!
[k]

＠Young Girl
What did you say? ...Just because you are a noble...[sr]you killed me...How dare you...How dare you!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Carmilla
That's right. Being a noble is my way of life. I am[sr]afraid to say that I am not the type to be tormented by guilt.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Carmilla
I am evil. Utter and thorough evil. Void of salvation,[sr]I am a ludicrous beast that died in sheer despair.
[k]

＠Carmilla
However, I am not so foolish to have regretted my evil[sr]and lost sight of what lies before me.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Carmilla
It was perfectly logical to curse me, but to invite these ones in as well was foolish.
[k]

＠Carmilla
You will receive pity if you were to only curse me, to curse all of those living, then you're no better than me.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Carmilla
In that case[line 3]I shall crush you, without a shred of mercy.
[k]

＠Carmilla
Even if you are a phantom, I will wring every last drop of blood from you!
