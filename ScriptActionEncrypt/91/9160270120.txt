＠Katsushika Hokusai
Here, lemme see that letter again.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Hmm... Well, I can't read Tang-era Chinese either,[sr]but I can tell you it's beautifully written.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
But the characters that are Chinese-only, not Japanese, look like they've been copied rather than written.
[k]

？1：Meaning...?
？2：And that means...?
？！

[charaFace D 14]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Whoever wrote this letter was born in Japan, same as me, and knows their way around a calligraphy brush.

Don't worry, it looks like Master here's already got an idea of who fits that description. It won't be long before we find 'em.

＠Katsushika Hokusai
But watch yourself.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Lookin' at it from a painter's perspective, I'd say this letter was written by someone who's super strict and serious.
[k]

[charaFace D 14]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
...Pretty sure whoever it is ain't[sr]gonna talk without puttin' up a fight.

So, it isn't that you don't know anything...it's that you won't say anything? Do I have that right?

Master, I am fully aware that you are my current lord.

However, I am bound by another contract.

Oho, you don't say.

What if it wasn't a request from Master Pá Tù...but[sr]a direct order from a noble empress such as myself?
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Tell us why you wrote this letter. If you were compelled by another to do so, then tell us why they requested it, and who is responsible!
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Wu Zetian
If you come clean and tell me everything right now,[sr]I am willing to be lenient with your punishment!

On my honor as Tajima-no-Kami, once I have sworn an oath, there is nothing that can make me break it...not even the ruler of a vast country.

Ah! Wait, Wu Zetian!

＠Mash
From everything I know about Yagyu, he's not the kind of Servant to come clean, even if you defeat him!
[k]

＠Mash
Can you please reconsider before... Never mind.[sr]It looks like I'm too late...!
