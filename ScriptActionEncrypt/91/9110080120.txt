But Doctor, I thought Fafnir was summoned by that Jeanne.

＠Dr. Roman
Siegfried's correct.

＠Dr. Roman
She needed the Grail to exist as a Servant, there's no sign of it in France.

＠Siegfried
By defeating Fafnir, I left behind a legend and became a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Siegfried
But, my very existence itself is also the proof that "Fafnir exists."
[k]

＠Siegfried
Not to mention it's already been summoned once here in France.
[k]

＠Siegfried
So long as Fafnir isn't killed completely, it will keep reviving.
[k]

＠Mash
But I thought its Master, Jeanne no longer exists...

＠Siegfried
Dragons generates magical energy simply by breathing.

Living. Just by doing that,[sr]it's possible to generate magical energy!
