I was sad when I was here, but I never gave in to despair.

Even if I died, even if my husband the King died, even if my beloved children died...

＠Marie Antoinette
Even if the people forget the royal family's[sr]white lilies, France will be eternal.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
That's what I believed.[sr]I believed that this was necessary for France.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
That's why "giving up" is the one thing I didn't do.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
It may change form, but France is eternal.[sr]The white lilies of glory shall never fade.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Marie Antoinette
Vive La France![sr]Glory to our nation, France!

＠Marie Antoinette?
...What a joke.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette?
That's nothing but self-deception. The foolish lies[sr]of a foolish queen, killed by her foolish people.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette?
The man you loved was killed. Your children were killed.[sr]And yet, Vive La France? Really?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Marie Antoinette?
You're a liar.[sr]Tell them what you really think, why don't you?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette?
You want France, and its foolish people who trampled on your royal white lilies, to die.

Yes, Mash is right.

＠Marie Antoinette
Both of us are real.[sr]Both of us are me.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
I am the "Marie" who never gave up.[sr]She is the "Marie" that did.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
I am the "Marie" who decided to regret nothing.[sr]She is the "Marie" who sorrows, rages, and curses.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Both of us...are me.[sr]Neither is a fake.

＠Marie Antoinette?
I'm the real Marie Antoinette. A foolish queen who[sr]broke her heart trying to save her people, and was betrayed!
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette?
My curse upon France![sr]May it suffer a millennia of starvation and war!
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette?
May it be crushed[line 2][sr]Under the wheels of endless revolution!

＠Mash
It's a burning torrent of emotion, as sharp as a knife.

She carried this inside of her...[sr]And she still always smiled at us[line 2]

Pathetic, aren't "I?"[sr]How could I forget smiles and love?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
No matter how much I am hurt, or hated, I can never stop smiling.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
Shouldn't that be the duty of a Queen?[sr]No matter what my end was[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
Say, why don't we stay dazzling?[sr]Let's smile at everyone, every nation, and the world.

＠Marie Antoinette
That is the "Marie" who decided to leave her mother and become the White Lily of France.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
That's why...[sr]I will not accept you.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Marie Antoinette?
How dare you, Marie Antoinette! In that case,[sr]I will make you succumb to me, and I shall rise!
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette?
They want to incinerate the world?[sr]Fine! Let them!
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette?
The people, the country, the world that stole my life and the lives of the people I loved!
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette?
Let it all be destroyed, with no records or memories left![sr]The guillotine is too good for it!
