The act of saving someone is arrogant by nature.
[k]

＠
But unless one accepts that arrogance, one cannot hope to help others.
[k]

＠
Saving someone is a simple act.[sr]One simply needs to sincerely care about others.
[k]

＠
But then, what about saving the world?
[k]

＠
I thought I understood what that involved, but perhaps I do not have the answer at all.
[k]

＠
What's necessary is uncompromisable power.
[k]

＠
The power of salvation that would equally save, with ruthless efficiency, everything in this world.
[k]

＠
Of course, I answered this summon for the purpose of saving humanity.
[k]

＠
But somewhere in my heart I'm searching for that power.
[k]

＠
...That's right. The ruthless salvation that is the Holy Grail.

I've been meaning to ask.[sr]Amakusa, why do you use Black Keys?

They didn't exist in the place and time you were alive in, right?

？！

＠Dr. Roman
They're the Holy Church's Craft Essence. I don't know the details, but it's some kind of ranged weapon that uses Bible fragments.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's no record of you belonging to the Holy Church, and that technology hadn't been imported into Japan at that time...

＠Amakusa Shirou
But what I just described contradicts the records in this world. Perhaps what I went through was some occurrence brought forth by an impossible process.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
Even so, this form is without a doubt my most useful form as a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Amakusa Shirou
Normally, I am a third-rate Servant who can't even become a Ruler.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
The best I could possibly hope for is to be a Caster.
[k]

？1：Maybe you could get Medea to teach you?

＠Amakusa Shirou
Hahahaha.[sr]No way. I'd die.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
Mages from the Age of Gods are like... Well, if they are a motorcycle, modern mages like us would be regular bicycles.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Amakusa Shirou
Besides, I'm probably more of a simple spellcaster.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
I don't treat magecraft as something mystical.[sr]To me, it's just useful.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
...Well, it seems like there are other Servants who feel the same way.
[k]

？2：Maybe you could get Edison to teach you?

[charaFace C 0]
＠Amakusa Shirou
Edison, huh...

＠Amakusa Shirou
...[sr][charaFace C 4]...

[charaFace C 1]
＠Amakusa Shirou
Oh, it's simple.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
Because, in the Holy Grail War where I was incarnated, my Master broke the rules.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Amakusa Shirou
Normally Rulers are an eighth class. Their role is to mediate the Holy Grail War; their Master is the Grail itself.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
It is a Ruler's duty to remain neutral.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
...But my Master ignored all that and tried to summon one directly. Master wanted to win the war, see.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
A normal Ruler, summoned during a regular Holy Grail War, possesses Command Spells that affect all participating Servants.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Amakusa Shirou
...Spells so powerful they can even be used to order Servants to commit suicide.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
As such, making a Ruler into a familiar would, in my Master's eyes, guarantee victory in the war.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
...And so that's what my Master did[line 2]with me. My summoning as a Ruler was a violation of the rules. [charaFace C 4]It shouldn't have happened.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
...But because it did, I was able to be summoned as a Ruler from there on out. I suppose I gained that right.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Amakusa Shirou
Of course, unless it's an urgent matter such as restoring humanity, it's almost impossible to summon me...
[k]

[charaFadeout C 0.1]

[communicationChara 98003003 1 5 0 0]

＠Dr. Roman
I see.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...So you weren't summoned as a Ruler because you naturally had the right.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You were summoned as one because there was a precedence from some other time.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So then if that is the story, regardless to the particulars, it established a pathway to call you in this form again.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The second summoning was probably much easier.
