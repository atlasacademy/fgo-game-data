Of course, I'm confident that my “Edison-type Bolg Breaker” will win!

A blade that could cut through all forms of Magecraft would surely pierce that shield-type Noble Phantasm!

I mean, my Noble Phantasm works against Servants,[sr]but not against other Noble Phantasms.

It would be especially tough when the target's a shield created precisely to ward off attacks.

＠Emiya
Mr. Edison, don't you think you're giving up a little too fast?
[k]

＠Emiya
The idea itself isn't a bad one. Rule Breaker is a broken item that could sever any contract.
[k]

＠Emiya
If you could land a direct hit, any Servant would be liberated from the bonds of its contract.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Emiya
...So. For example, why not try matching it with Hrunting?
[k]

＠Emiya
That Noble Phantasm pursues the enemy it sniffs out. A different type of Noble Phantasm from reversing cause and effect.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Edison
Oh, Emiya, you understand me!

[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Emiya
You are a genius! But wouldn't forcing the joints like that make the connecting parts more fragile?
[k]

＠Edison
Silly, that's our chance to make it look even cooler![sr]Add in bolts and armor plates to give it more volume...
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Edison
...and it will be twice as large after combining![sr]I have a feeling this thing will sell as a toy!

[charaFace G 5]

Always looking at the positive side of things![sr]I'd expect no less from the King of Inventions!
