The wolf's dark claws and the lion's glistening fangs clash fiercely in midair...again and again.
[k]

＠
On one side, the wolf who remained true to himself even as he became a Demonic Beast...
[k]

＠
...and on the other, a chimera, a grotesque Demonic Beast decried as an abomination from the day it was born.

The mountain goat's horns keep the wolf's fangs from finding their mark. The lion's fangs keep the rider at bay.
[k]

＠
The snake tail harries the wolf[sr]with bites all over its body.
[k]

＠
The fountains of blood only make the wolf more ferocious. His roiling hatred is on the brink of awakening a wholly new form.
[k]

＠
...What do you think? Can you do this?
[k]

＠
The wolf is unsure if he just heard Hessian's voice,[sr]or Master's, but it doesn't matter.
[k]

＠
His only answer is an affirmative howl.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

I can.

He signals to Master, who nods back and[sr]activates one of [&his:her] Command Spells.[se bas16][seVolume bas16 0 0.2]

...What do you think? Can you do this?
[k]

＠
His answer is the same as before.
[k]

＠
But now, he realizes that it is[sr]he who is asking the question.
[k]

＠
I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this.[sr]I can do this. I can do this. I can do this...

I WILL do this.

The rider drops his scythe-shaped sword, and the wolf immediately catches it between his teeth.

At the same time, the rider's mantle[sr]itself transforms into a fan of blades.

The wolf explodes forward like a bullet,[sr]swinging his blade like the Grim Reaper himself.

As the rider deflects every one of the goat and snake's strikes, the wolf's blade bites through the lion's neck before its fangs can pierce their prey.
[k]

＠
In a flash, the battle is over. All that remains[sr]is an eerie silence, and the stench of blood.
[k]

＠
The wolf makes not a sound as he glares[sr]at the Demonic Beast's carcass.
[k]

＠
He feels neither happy nor sad.[sr]Only the slightest pang of sentimentality.

...He then lazily turns his attention skyward.
[k]

＠
Neither the moonlight nor the[sr]stars' twinkling suit him anymore.
[k]

＠
The only thing that suits him now is the vivid neon lights of man-made cities from the forest's shadows.
[k]

＠
The wolf smiles, content in that notion.
[k]

＠
Even if he can never return to those plains,[sr]he cannot let their memory die.

This he can never permit.

...For his descendants, apparently.

Lobo and Blanca had cubs, you see.
[k]

＠Enkidu
If they were lucky, they may have[sr]survived and grown into adults.
[k]

＠Enkidu
It's possible they went on to grow their numbers,[sr]leave America, and head for another country.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Though of course, it is only a possibility.[sr]Whether it is even probable, well...
[k]

Truth be told, it's more likely that[sr]his bloodline died out a long time ago.

＠
The wolf dreams of something that can never be.
[k]

＠
He dreams of himself, Blanca, and his beloved cubs,[sr]all joyously running across the plains together.
[k]

＠
It's a foolish dream.[sr]It may only serve to make him miserable.
[k]

＠
But, even if that dream can never be...there is no reason he cannot wish for it anyway.
[k]

＠
So he will believe in his dream,[sr]and die for it if he must.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠
That is why he answered the summons.[sr]He needed no other reason.
[k]

＠
That is why he protects the weak,[sr]fragile human leaning against him.
[k]

＠
The wolf howls at the moon,[sr]thinking back to his time in the plains.
[k]

＠
The path ahead of him is long and winding, but the Wolf King continues to walk it without hesitation.

Then, a thought occurs to him.
[k]

＠
The weight of his Master leaning against him now...reminds him of how his cubs used to snuggle so innocently against him.
[k]

＠
So he will continue on. He will howl, he will live,[sr]he will crush, he will destroy...
[k]

＠
...and he will protect.
