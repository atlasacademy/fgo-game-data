＠Siegfried
I am sorry.[sr]I am so very sorry...
[k]

＠Siegfried
I tried to stop her, but she insisted she really needed them, and then my Golden Rule got too powerful...
[k]

＠Brynhild
I'm sorry...Caesar asked me if my love was getting cold, and he suggested I cook something that would invigorate a husband.
[k]

＠Brynhild
And he said that making a stew with ten hearts would be just the thing...
[k]

＠Siegfried
Exactly... [wt 0.5][charaShake B 0.05 3 3 0.3]Ungh...[wt 0.5] It did bring my Golden Rule[sr]back to its peak when I was in my prime...[wt 1.0][charaShake B 0.05 3 3 0.3] (Burp)...

？1：So that's why you look so pale...
？2：That sounds...not good...

If the material was used in a dish made by a loving wife for her husband, then I have no cause for anger.
[k]

＠Gawain
It's a shame I lost the Hearts, but it's a small price to pay to reinforce a couple's love. The materials are yours to keep.

Oh...thank you very much...[sr]And I apologize. I misunderstood you...

＠Gawain
No, I'm quite used to being seen as stuffy.[sr]Please, think nothing of it.
[k]

＠Gawain
After all, I'm always with Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristan. Compared to those two, I must certainly seem rather boring.
[k]

＠Gawain
Anyway, a loving couple is a good thing.[sr]I wish you two eternal happiness.

Yes. Thank you, Sir Gawain.[sr]Ah, that carefree smile of yours... I am quite troubled...
[k]

？1：Yeah, even if you're a pretend couple!
？2：(And then, Siegfried was never seen again...)
