But...he also said that if I'm truly going to see Lavinia Whateley again, it would probably happen at a time when I'm no longer me anymore...

？1：She's just as capable as any other Chaldean now.


[charaFace A 8]
＠Abigail
Really...?
[k]

＠Abigail
Then she was able to become a proper Servant?[sr]She must have worked so hard.
[k]


[charaFace A 3]
＠Abigail
Then, um...could you maybe praise her...even just once every month or so...?
[k]

＠Abigail
I-if you praised her every day,[sr]she'd get so overcome she'd just pass out.
[k]

？2：She was a little unsure of herself, but she adjusted in no time.


[charaFace A 8]

Is that so...

[charaFace A 1]

That makes me so happy.[sr]I'm sure she has you and Mash to thank for it.

[k]

＠Abigail
I can feel the trust that all of your companions place in her radiating through this Spirit Origin I, uh, borrowed.
[k]

＠Abigail
It wouldn't even be possible for me to be here talking to you like this without permission from the version of me here in Chaldea.
[k]


[charaFace A 4]
＠Abigail
I'm so sorry...
[k]

＠Abigail
I've definitely overstayed any welcome I[sr]might have had. I'd better be on my way.
