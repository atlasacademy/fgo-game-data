Hm...Master, can I have a minute?[sr]This town lacks something. What do you think it is?
[k]

？1：Smiles.

？2：Happiness.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Shakespeare
Exactly! The world is a stage, and the men and[sr]women coming and going on it are performers.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Shakespeare
Regardless, there is no smile in this town.[sr]No happiness. Why is that[line 2]?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Shakespeare
It's because there is no drama![sr]If so, shall we put up an improv for people to see?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
An improv? ...And you said "we."...[sr]By "we", you mean...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Shakespeare
Why, of course I mean myself, Mash Kyrielight, and Master [%1].
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
I-Impossible![sr]I've never seen or performed a play!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Shakespeare
Oh, you haven't?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Y-Yes. I'm sorry for my inexperience...[sr]But there was never any need for me to...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Shakespeare
Hahaha, what are you talking about?[sr]That need is more apparent than ever for you!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Shakespeare
What you need right now is love, words and poetry![sr]A kindled passion is exactly what you need!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Ohhhh, but...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Shakespeare
Oh, and a shield and weapon, too.[sr]It's kind of sudden, I know[line 2]

Monsters![sr]Monsters are coming[line 2]!

＠Shakespeare
But monsters are coming all of a sudden, you see!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
W-Why is that[line 2]?
[k]

？1：W-We should deal with them.

？2：Let's protect everyone!

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Shakespeare
Oh, what a courageous line![sr]But I wish you'd made your delivery a bit more complex.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Shakespeare
"Hear your death bell ringing! Are you going[sr]to heaven, or to hell!" ...How about that?
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Uh, excuse me.[sr]Please join the battle!
