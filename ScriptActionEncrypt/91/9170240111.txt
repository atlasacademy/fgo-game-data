We didn't learn this until much later...
[k]

＠X Alter
...but the incident on Totooine was just[sr]the opening act of a huge conspiracy.

I still find it hard to believe that the legendary bounty hunter, Edgy Fett, was masterminding the whole thing...

So we ended up letting him get away, failing the assignment, and having to stay behind for special training, AGAIN!

That's right. They say he'll only work for enormous cash bounties, and that even the League of Villains fears him.
[k]

＠X Alter
There are also rumors that say he's the Alter of a certain hero, and that Edgy Fett is just a codename.
