...Hm.[sr]This area should serve our needs well.
[k]

＠Altria
No one in sight, no buildings either. I don't think there will be casualties no matter what happens here.

...Um, Senpai ...Altria is sounding very ominous.[sr]What do you think she plans to do this time?
[k]

？1：I don't know.

？2：She brought us here without explanation...

？！

[charaFace D 1]

Now then, first I must thank you Master.[sr]You listened to another unreasonable request from me.

Well, you did ask to go to a deserted wasteland out of the blue. What did you need [%1] for?

＠Altria
Yes. I thought I might carry out a plan that I[sr]have been considering for a while.
[k]

＠Altria
As more Heroic Spirits are assisting Chaldea, our battles are also growing proportionally fiercer.
[k]

＠Altria
To be honest, don't you feel we are currently ill-equipped? Since we don't know what we'll run into in the future.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Well...yes. As a defense specialist, it's not my place to say, but I'm not sure we'll last with our current firepower.
[k]

＠Altria
I thought so.[sr]Which is why I think it's time for me to be serious.

＠Altria
I have been fighting seriously, but with limitation.
[k]

＠Altria
My sword is, shall we say, complicated in its workings.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Altria
For example, it must not strike one pure of heart.[sr]I also must not strike a fairy.
[k]

＠Altria
Such are the multiple oaths of this sword. If any are violated, the power of my Mana Burst is reduced.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Something like a dress code, perhaps.
[k]

＠Mash
So what you're saying is, your sword has never been fully unleashed?
[k]

＠Altria
Yes. A strike with all of its oaths released[sr]will probably be an once in a lifetime event.
[k]

＠Altria
I'm not even sure if we'll even get such a chance, but for[sr]now, I would like to release some of the oathes to raise its output.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Altria
That's the reason I brought you[sr]to this place [%1].

"Anyone who fights at my side must be courageous"[line 3]In order to fulfil this oath.

In this case, it means strength of spirit, not body.[sr]Does this person possess the courage to face someone stronger.
[k]

＠Altria
The sacred sword scales to the strength of a Master's heart. With that being said[line 3]
