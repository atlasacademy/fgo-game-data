So this is the fate of the Greater Grail?[sr][line 3]Hmph. A terrible end.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Based on what I know, if everything had gone the way they should, the ceremony could have accomplished something.

S-Sorry...[sr]It was impudent of me to even speak, wasn't it...

＠Gilgamesh
Fear not. You must be the Demi-Servant. Then I shall allow it. However, refer me as your King from now on.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
S-Sure![sr]T-T-Then from now on, I'll call you by King of Heroes!

Oh my. The scary King of the Uruks[sr]has taken a liking to our Mash.

Think he's got his reasons?

Mage. No, I see that you refer to yourself as a Doctor,[sr]then Physician is what I shall call you.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Physician from the future.[sr]What are you people, this Chaldea?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I speak not only of the Demi-Servant.[sr]The young one there is far too inexperienced.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Gilgamesh
An incomplete warrior[sr]and a barely competent Master.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Do you truly believe a pairing like that[sr]can secure the future of humanity?

＠Dr. Roman
That's harsh. It was a tough decision for me, too.[sr]Right, [%1]?
[k]

？1：There are no other Masters.

？2：I must fight even if I'm not competent.

Senp... no, Master is right.[sr]I understand that you disapprove of us.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
But there's no one else left at Chaldea who can fight.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
We have no choice but to mature[sr]through this battle, O King of Heroes.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Gilgamesh
So you fight because you must... If you put it that way,[sr]then I can't question such determination any further.

＠Gilgamesh
Humans are creatures that only develop their talents[sr]for the sake of the benefits they gain.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
[%1]. Mash. Ascertain to the utmost[sr]what your benefits are in this battle.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Gilgamesh
But first, you must guarantee my benefits.[sr]Otherwise, we will be enemies.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
E-Enemy!? S-S-Senpai, what do you think[sr]benefits the King of Heroes?
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Treasure? It's treasure, isn't it?[sr]But we don't have any treasure that could satisfy him!
[k]

？1：Yeah, more like we want treasure!

？2：Help us, Doctor!

？！

＠Gilgamesh
Don't lose your composure. I expect no treasure from[sr]you. What I seek from you is, THAT.

＠Dr. Roman
[%1], Mash! Show that King what you can do!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Of course, don't forget to also give the King of Heroes[sr]your orders. You are his Master right now, after all.
[k]

？1：S-Sure!

？2：Of course, lots of orders!

But, he speaks the truth. No matter how inexperienced,[sr]you are the [&man:woman] I contracted with.

Fear me, respect me,[sr]and fulfill your duty as the one who contracted with me!
