No surprise there. This town was destroyed a long time ago. Even if the world has repaired itself, even if its citizens are revived...
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
The only thing Humanity repairs is history. The hatred and despair engraved on this timeline will never fade away.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
It's simple. Hatred and despair die hard.[sr]Anything could cause those remnants to resurface.

[charaFace C 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
That's why we must crush them first.[sr]Do you follow?

She's not asking if you're ready to put your life on the line for this upcoming battle.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Geronimo
She's asking if you're capable of exterminating those spirits. They might become evil in the future, but right now, they're still innocent.

[charaFace B 2]

？2：Of course I am.

[charaFace C 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
...Hmph, I wonder if you really are.

＠Jeanne Alter
What if I told you those spirits are still innocent?[sr]Would you still say you're ready to put them down?
