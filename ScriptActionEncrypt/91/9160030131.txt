That's right. Gozul, Makul, Zayed...everyone's looking for you. You should at least put in an appearance so everyone can stop worrying.

＠Hundred Personas
And after that...if you want to come back to your new friends and play, you may do as you like.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
They're also Master's Servants. Spending time interacting with others is a good thing.

[charaFace B 3]

Hm. Perhaps that is your new role here.

If she isn't going to get harmed, and if the people at home are worried, then obviously she should go home once in a while.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Nursery Rhyme
You just need to come here whenever you want to have a tea party!
[k]

＠Nursery Rhyme
When you've left all your worries behind, or forgotten them, or just foisted them onto the adults, that's when we have a great, grand tea party!

？1：?
？！

＠Hundred Personas
While we are a conglomerate, we are individuals. We do not, however, have any sort of connection that would allow us to communicate mentally.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
That's why it took all of us,[sr]and so much effort, to find her.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
And that is why she also didn't know who you are or what your purpose is.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
And that's probably why she didn't[sr]want to leave the children's room.

Hehe... As a Servant who has spent a lot of time contracted with Master, I can tell you this much:
[k]

＠Mash
As long as we are here,[sr]we won't ever let you get hurt. Absolutely not.
[k]

＠Mash
And like the other Hundred Personas, you won't have to do the sort of dirty jobs you did in the past.

[k]

＠Hundred Personas
Even though we are a Servant best suited for that kind of dirty work, Master has never once ordered us to do anything of the sort.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
And the fact that we know with certainty that Master would never issue such orders...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

It's like we just found a new friend here in Chaldea.
[k]

＠Mash
We should introduce her to the other Hundred Personas, as well as to the other Servants. Oh, and we should give her a tour of Chaldea, too.
[k]

＠Mash
Um, Little Hassan.[sr]Is there anywhere you would like to go?
