This is TOTALLY why people always say oni suck, or that they're clueless, or that they just like to attack when you're minding your own business...

Your lazy asses are why I got sent to Japan in the first place. You just couldn't be bothered to do your damn jobs. You caused me no end of trouble.

＠Suzuka Gozen
Japan is just a group of tiny islands. You could have turned it into a demon kingdom in a week if you actually cared! But no! You just wanted to hang around in your little lairs, having your fun!
[k]

Easy to believe all you did was get drunk even then! I suspect you only bothered attacking humans when you were bored and felt like it!
