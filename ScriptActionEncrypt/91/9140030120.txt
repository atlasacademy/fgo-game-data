Get out of my way if you want to survive!

If you win, we're your dinner![sr]If we win, you're finished!

＠Drake
If you're okay with that, then come at me![sr]I'll strip you to the bone, and sell your meat and pelts!

...It was very nice of you[sr]to let the monsters run away like that, Captain.
[k]

＠Drake
Huh? I didn't save them. I just didn't want to kill too many and hurt this island's ecosystem.

＠Drake
We'll be rich if these pelts go for a high price back on[sr]land. Then, it'll be our loss if none of them are left, right?

＠Mash
I-I see... Ahaha...[sr]That's right, this is the kind of person Captain Drake is...

＠Dr. Roman
Everybody, I think there's a cave over there. But I'm[sr]picking up a weird reading. Be careful if you go in.

＠Drake
It's nice to have a scout.[sr]Okay, let's be careful on our way in then.

Man, we hit the jackpot.[sr]A typical little treasure room.

＠Drake
It probably belonged to pirates who lived in this area.[sr]The treasure's still here, so of course[line 3]

There's a guard.[sr]Captain Drake, can we defeat it?

Go ahead. I don't see traps that'll blow up the treasure.[sr]Have fun!

Roger.[sr]Master, let's rip this thing apart!
