＠Mash
So, you want us to defeat the Doll King?
[k]

＠Medea
Well, to put it simply, yes.[sr]I am requesting your involvement.
[k]

？1："The Doll King?"

？2：I don't quite follow you...

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Medea
...Must I explain it again?[sr]I brought a 50-centimeter diorama.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Medea
It's a miniature garden I've made. To put it in[sr]terms you'd understand, it's a kind of Reality Marble.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Um, well... I mean it's just a small model of a house with figures lined up in it...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Medea
What a rude human you are. This diorama is something[sr]that, little by little, day by day, with layer upon layer of precise spell...
[k]

＠Medea
I finally succeeded in creating. The ultimate Bounded[sr]Field. Well, I guess the likes of you wouldn't be able to comprehend it.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
You're right, I don't get it at all. My studies[sr]have been insufficient. I must reflect on this.
[k]

？1：Caster, you like things like this, don't you?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Medea
Oh, is it that obvious? I enjoy bottle ship models the[sr]best, but isn't it nice to try your hand at something grander?
[k]

＠Medea
This time I got excited and made it without[sr]considering the profitability. Hehehe.
[k]

？2：I don't think anyone could understand, Mash.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Yes, I was beginning to feel that way.[sr]This appears to be Medea's special hobby...
[k]

＠Mash
Holed up in her room, concentrated yet gloomy.[sr]I guess you can call that a nerdy hobby in a sense.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Medea
Please refrain from calling it a nerdy hobby.[sr]Some people might get hurt by that comment, like me.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
True. I take back my words.[sr]This isn't just any model, it's an exquisite diorama.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
...Well then.[sr]Is the "Doll King" perhaps[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Medea
Yes.[sr]I'm referring to inside this small world.
[k]

＠Medea
Inside this diorama is what one might call another[sr]dimension. To put it into terms amateurs like yourselves could understand...
[k]

＠Medea
...you could even call it the world of dolls.[sr]The dolls inside this house are literally alive.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Medea
Of course, this is because these are dolls I personally take the time to create.
[k]

？1：How capable is this Witch from the Age of Gods...

？2：She's got a lot of free time.

？！

[charaFace D 5]
＠Medea
You there, what did you say?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Medea
I already said this, so I'm sure you got it.[sr]I want you to perform some maintenance for me.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Medea
The doll I gave administrative rights to over this world is ignoring my orders and has begun to act without permission.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Medea
Seriously! He has forgotten the debt owed to me[sr]as his creator and bitten the hand that feeds him!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...Ah well. I don't fully understand, but[sr]couldn't we just remove that doll from the outside?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Medea
If I could have done that, I already would have.[sr]If we intervene from the outside, everything will break.
[k]

＠Medea
It may be easy to add or alter, but removing takes several times more skill and sense.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Medea
There are many people who can revise a completed novel, but very few would erase the characters, no?
[k]

＠Medea
That is what it means to draw elements from things that have been completed.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Medea
Even by removing a single doll, the damage would be far greater.
[k]

＠Medea
This is why the beings that humans think of as gods have not laid a hand on the world since it was created.
[k]

＠Medea
No matter how much damage spreads, the creators can only look on from the outside.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Medea
In order to minimalize damage, it is best to go in and involve oneself.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Quite right, but...[sr]how would one enter...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Medea
Rest assured, I will show you the way.[sr]Now, calm your minds...hehehehehehe.
[k]

？1：That's not reassuring at all...

？2：I-I feel kind of light-headed...

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Senpai!?[sr]...Senpai!

＠Mash
Medea! What just...[sr]I mean, where exactly is this?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Medea
I TOLD you. Inside the box.[sr]How is it, the world I so carefully constructed?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Medea
"Imaginary Earth: Social Plan World"[sr]For short, "Jason World: Japan!"
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Medea
I have prepared a variety of attractions here!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Medea
Basically, any man with a pretty face is set to meet with a terrible fate♡
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...Um, Senpai?
[k]

？1：Talk about a hostile theme park.

？2：How did things get so complicated?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Medea, putting aside the explanation of these "attractions," could you tell us exactly how we got here?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Medea
Oh, you still don't understand?[sr]I prepared some dolls here to be used by guests.
[k]

＠Medea
I shifted your consciousness here.[sr]Just think of it as a consciousness-only Rayshift.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Just our consciousness...[sr]Isn't that a big deal?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Medea
It's all right, I've set it so you can return once you've defeated this world's administrator.
[k]

＠Medea
Oh, don't worry about the entry fee.[sr]It was my idea, so this time it's free!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Uh. It looks like there's no choice but to give in to Medea's request.

＠Mash
[line 3][sr]Senpai, someone carrying a sword is approaching!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Medea
That's a Level 10 general soldier, a Jason Hunter.[sr]It's programmed to attack normies on sight.
[k]

＠Medea
There are also Jason Killers who rampage when they see couples, those who bring friends, or more than two people.
[k]

＠Medea
And Jason Aces who challenge any girl under twenty on sight.
[k]

＠Medea
Not to mention, Naked Jason who won't rest until he destroys anything and everything around him.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
Medea, that's overkill!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Medea
Oh, and if you die here, you'll be able to return to your[sr]body... But some of the pain will carry over, so be careful.
[k]

＠Medea
If you receive enough damage and die, you'll feel pain worse than death when you wake up.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Simply outrageous...[sr]Anyway, Master, prepare for combat!
