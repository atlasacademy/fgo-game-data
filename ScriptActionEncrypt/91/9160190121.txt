No grave marker, no posthumous name.[sr]Just numerous unnamed shinobi.

But at the same time, that is something to be proud of. That's what it means to be one of us.

We do not strive to be celebrated.[sr]We take pride in our anonymity.

I'm sure my grave is somewhere here too. Marked[sr]not as Fuuma Kotarou, but as an unnamed shinobi.

And now, Katou Danzo has finally joined us.[sr]One of the few who knew the first leader's techniques.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
She completed educating and raising the fifth leader, and she understood that her duties were fulfilled.

I'm satisfied.[sr]Yes, what a wonderful ending.

I was able to include her to be one[sr]of us...as “just” another ninja.
