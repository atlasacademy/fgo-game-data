＠Wu Zetian
By the way, Mash, it occurs to me that you have been Mash for far too long, so I shall give you a new name.

＠Wu Zetian
Indeed. I grow bored of always doing the same things, or always saying the same things.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
A ruler's view does not change much from day to day, whether she sits on a throne or remains in the shadows.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Of course, one could argue that such stability is the sign of a healthy country...but as the ruler, it can grow quite tedious and stifling.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
As a result, I would often change the names of some of the most boring parts of my domain: eras, ranks, cities, regions...
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Of course, nowadays, the only names I go around changing are yours. Hmm, what to do for you, Mash...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Wu Zetian
Hmm. Got it! I shall call you Zǐcài! “Zǐ” is the character for “purple,” so it suits your color scheme perfectly.

I see. So it's like a nickname.
[k]

＠Mash
I haven't had much experience with things like that,[sr]so this is kind of new for me. Thank you.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Can I ask what it means?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Wu Zetian
Oh, yes. In your language, the word for it is...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Wu Zetian
...seaweed.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]

＠Mash
...!?
[k]

？1：C-come on, Mash, seaweed is yummy!
？2：Hey, seaweed is super nutritious!
？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠Mash
Y-yes, I guess that's true.[sr]And it does have a very unique ring to it.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Wu Zetian
There, that feels much newer and nicer.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
By the way, where are we headed now?[sr]Didn't you say you had to get ready?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Wu Zetian
Didn't I tell you? I am doing a bit of[sr]headhunting for the proper personnel.

＠Wu Zetian
The insolent author of that letter was not merely content to wait for me at the appointed time and place.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
The letter also said they had placed obstacles along the way. Pure harassment, that's what it is!
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
It said the obstacles would suit a coward frightened of ghosts. That should tell us what to expect.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Wu Zetian
What nonsense! They misunderstand completely![sr]I am not the least bit afraid of ghosts!
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Yes, the mere thought sends shivers down my spine, and the idea that none of my torture instruments would hurt them makes me reluctant to go to the lavatory in the middle of the night! But nothing more than that!

＠Wu Zetian
Indeed. Any good ruler must be able to convince others to do her bidding, and there can be no empress around who is better than my royal self.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
In fact, I have already found[sr]the perfect person to help.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Wu Zetian
If I am being completely honest, I have been trying to keep my distance from her for various reasons, but now that I have no alternative, well...here we are.

[charaFace D 1]

＠Sanzang
Really? Then I guess we actually are acquaintances. Hold on, give me a minute. It's riiight on the tip of my tongue!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Sanzang
...Gah! I guess the fact that I can't quite seem to remember shows I still need to train a lot more!
[k]


[charaFace B 0]

＠Wu Zetian
Now, now, I do not blame you for being unable to remember. I have no memory of ever conversing with you before, either.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
I most likely just happened to see you[sr]in my palace at one point or another.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Sanzang
Did you say palace?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Wu Zetian
Yes, in the city of Chang'an.[sr]I trust you are familiar with Emperor Taizong?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Sanzang
Of course.[sr]He was an emperor of the Tang dynasty, right?
[k]

＠Sanzang
The whole reason I headed to Tianzhu was because he ordered me to. At least, I'm pretty sure it was him.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I definitely remember him being thrilled when I told him I'd brought back the sutras. He was a nice guy!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Wu Zetian
Taizong was the emperor when[sr]I first became a concubine.

I am, and I did.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Wu Zetian
...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Sanzang
After I got back, I was so busy with copying the sutras that I had no idea what was going on politically...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Sanzang
...but I do think I at least heard your name before.
[k]

＠Sanzang
And now, here we both are in Chaldea. That's amazing! The Buddha must've had a hand in this, too!
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Wu Zetian
N-nn, so you only think you have heard my name before? Normally, I would be furious at such an insult...but I suppose that sort of ignorance is to be expected from a monk so removed from worldly affairs.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
And I do remember all the monks I used to know who were clued into politics being rather corrupt.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Sanzang
So, what can I do for you now? Anything I can do for a fellow Tang-erine, I'd be happy to!
[k]

＠Sanzang
If you want to hear all about my journey, or listen to some sutra chanting, I'd be glad to oblige!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Wu Zetian
Hmm, you certainly have a lot of energy and volume to spare... Zǐcài, you tell her the rest.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

Zǐcài...? As in, seaweed?

I suppose that is all right. We certainly would not want you to be unable to perform your job after encountering a ghost.

Go on then, let me see the vaunted[sr]power of the monks for myself!
