...Wait a minute! Senpai and Quetzalcoatl[sr]are entangled in a very questionable position!

Quetzalcoatl's legs are wrapped around[sr]Senpai's head... Wh-what is going on!?

＠Quetzalcoatl
This is called an Huracarrana! It is a move where a wrestler cradles the opponent's head with their thighs and flips around using their momentum...
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
The goal is to slam the opponent to the mat to get a fall. It's a very popular lucha libre move, yes!

[&He:She] is likely to bounce off the ring after hitting the mat, but it should be okay as long as [&he:she] grabs the rope at the right moment!

She has some nice moves, but the moment it turns into close combat, is not so flashy, no...

＠Quetzalcoatl
It's basically judo. Once you get caught[sr]in a grapple, you can't get away...
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
...But she's not so strong, so I can just toss her around after I slip her hold without even trying...
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
And that's no fun...

＠Quetzalcoatl
I want an aerial throw that sends someone flying, yes! I want lucha that excites an audience! ¡Muy emocionante!

Yes, yes! She puts so much effort into things she does for other people, rather than her own desires. That is the mark of a great person!

Sometimes it may be in vain, and it may even be a weakness occasionally, but that is exactly the sort of thing we have been hoping for all this time.
