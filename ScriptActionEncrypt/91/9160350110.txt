＠Yu Mei-ren
I... Well... You know...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Prince of Lan Ling
You have become far too accustomed to killing[sr]anyone who saw through your false identity.
[k]

＠Prince of Lan Ling
You may know how to live apart from human society,[sr]but if you wish to coexist peacefully with a human for any period of time...
[k]

＠Prince of Lan Ling
...you must learn a measure of self-control.
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren

Our Master may be young, but [&he:she] is both[sr]highly virtuous and incredibly understanding.

＠Prince of Lan Ling
[&He:She] will always accept you as you are.[sr]Of that, I have no doubt.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Prince of Lan Ling
But that accommodating nature also means [&he:she] is just[sr]as likely to treat you like a lunatic if you simply keep doing whatever you please.
[k]

＠Prince of Lan Ling
If you wish to have a positive relationship with [&him:her]...
[k]

＠Prince of Lan Ling
...you must show that you are willing to[sr]at least try to behave somewhat normally.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Yu Mei-ren
...You don't get it. I know [&he's:she's] a good person.[sr]I'm not about to question that after everything that's happened.
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
The problem is that our history[sr]is kind of...complicated?
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
Ugh, this is such a pain. I can't believe I have[sr]to explain all this to you, of all people.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Prince of Lan Ling
What's so complicated about it? Is [&he:she] the descendant[sr]of a clan you have history with or something?
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
I wish. No, I knew [&him:her] personally,[sr]before all this happened.
[k]

＠Prince of Lan Ling
Huh? ...Ah, now I see.
[k]

＠Prince of Lan Ling
Given how long you've lived, I suppose this sort of thing was bound to happen at some point. This IS a tricky problem.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Yu Mei-ren
Say you were summoned as a Servant by an enemy and ordered to fight against the emperor you served when you were alive. How would you feel?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Prince of Lan Ling
Oh! That's... Well, I would certainly[sr]do my best to carry out my orders, but...
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
That's basically what it's like for me now.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Prince of Lan Ling
Hmm. This problem is more than any human could hope to solve. I am afraid that my own very limited perspective on this may not be of much help...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Prince of Lan Ling
Wait, I know. Chaldea is home to a number of Divine Spirits as well as human Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Prince of Lan Ling
They should offer perspectives that transcend human notions of fate. Why not ask them for advice?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Yu Mei-ren
Hmm, maybe... I guess they'd be easier[sr]to talk to than a human Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Prince of Lan Ling
Then come with me.[sr]I'll introduce you to them right now.

Apparently, you're one of the few other Heroic Spirits in all of Chaldea who lived in modern times.

...(Sigh) All right, fine. We're talking PURELY hypothetical here, right? Just a thought experiment?

All right, if you insist...

Truth be told...there was someone I had[sr]serious issues with back when I was alive.

But now that I'm part of the Counter Force, I don't[sr]see any point in holding on to things like that.

I can't see them changing at all, just like I'm not about to change who I am now.

Now that I'm part of the Foundation of Humanity,[sr]I can't do anything about them, for good or bad.
