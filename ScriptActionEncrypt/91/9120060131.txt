There's something missing to call this a reenactment of the myth, but I guess I completed my duties.

Now the restoration of this age will continue without incident. Ahh, I'm beat.

I think I'll warm my feet while I listen to Magi☆Mari's relaxing playlist and have myself a nice peaceful sleep...

Good idea.[sr]Now, Rayshift us back, Doctor.

＠David
I'll put my plans to build a temple off till next time.[sr]My goal was to show off my cool side here today.

The giant killer David fighting as a Heroic Spirit rather than as a king. If it makes a good memory for you, that's enough for me.

...And since we went through that with you before,[sr]I was compelled to ask this question:
[k]

＠Mash
“David, did you know from the beginning?”

Hmmm, I don't know.[sr]That Rayshift trip was so long ago.
[k]

＠David
I don't really remember.[sr]But [charaFace A 1]I'll answer your question, Abishag.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠David
No, I didn't know.[sr]Honestly, I had no way of seeing it.
[k]

＠David
I may have figured out the identity of the King of Mages, but nothing beyond that.
[k]

＠David
When I saw him from afar in Chaldea,[sr]I thought to myself:
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠David
“That man has absolutely no freedom.” I couldn't put my finger on what exactly it was, but I could tell from his expression.
[k]

＠David
But he was different from my recollection of the man without freedom. The way he lacked it... He had chosen of his own free will to give it up.
[k]

＠David
So I chose not to think about it.[sr]I didn't intervene. [charaFace A 0]That was all.

＠Mash
As David spoke, I could see the sadness in his smile, but also...pride.
[k]

＠Mash
The way David acted toward Roman...the straightforward approach, so much so that some might call it cold...that was the best and only way he could honestly, sincerely communicate as the man he was.
[k]

＠Mash
...Yes, and that's why I think...
[k]

＠Mash
I am so glad that I did not notice anything behind their petty banter.
[k]

＠Mash
The great, ancient kings... They may not have ever demonstrated any connection, but that they had one was beyond question.
