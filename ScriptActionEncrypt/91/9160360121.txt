The bandits' lifeless bodies were strewn across the ground, just as the man's own body was now bruised and battered.

Blood stained the blade a vivid red. The man continued on his spree, mercilessly felling bandits left and right.

Taking the dagger out from his shirt pocket,[sr]he found it had already half-crumbled to dust.

Whoever you are, I bet you would[sr]have liked to do it yourself.

Hmm. Still, it sounds like there was nothing you could have done about that. Sometimes, people just die for no reason.

What I lacked back then was[sr]the composure to realize that.

I am neither a hero, nor a villain.

＠Li Shuwen
So I thought, at the very least, I should leave what I've learned behind for others to study.

Even I have something I want to protect. These fists can be quite useful at getting to the crux of certain matters.

“What were you doing with your[sr]life up till now, old man?”

But the old man would just laugh it off.
