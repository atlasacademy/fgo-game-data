WHY DON'T YOU INVITE ME OVER MORE OFTEN?

[charaFace A 0]

Yes, it seems Master is afraid of me, or is keeping [&his:her][sr]distance from me out of reverence.

It's true that I am a beautiful pharaoh. There is obviously a great disparity between our ranks, so being somewhat intimidated is understandable.

You can see the beautiful Cleopatra and...and the[sr]less beautiful, but still very beautiful Master.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
So, you should have more confidence! At the very least, know that I have absolute confidence in myself.

＠Cleopatra
Which means...no matter how plain they look or how boring they act, a human who is able to summon someone as beautiful as me must surely be beautiful!
