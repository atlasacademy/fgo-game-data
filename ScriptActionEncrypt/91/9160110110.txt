＠Jing Ke
Ah, Master and Mash. Good timing.[sr]There is a thing I want to ask you.
[k]

＠Mash
Sure, what's going on?
[k]

＠Jing Ke
I want you to train with me. I want a simulated[sr]battle, but its setting is a little complicated.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jing Ke
Roman taught me how, and I memorized it...[sr]But, I have a bad feeling.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
My intuition never fails in this kind of situation.[sr]I'm sure I will kill, no, I will break that device.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I-I see. That's one fantastic intuition.[sr]And, it's good you talked to us about it.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Let me take care of fine-tuning the settings.[sr]You can always count on me.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jing Ke
Oh, I appreciate it.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
So, how do you want it?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jing Ke
Defeat the king, this is what I want to train.
[k]

＠Mash
Understood. I suppose a situation similar to[sr]the one you were once in is all right?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jing Ke
Of course![sr]That's the way it should be.

＠Jing Ke
As you already know, I failed to assassinate the first emperor.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jing Ke
Nevertheless, I'm really thankful[sr]of Master for summoning me and letting me serve.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jing Ke
But, I can't just relax like this.[sr]I must succeed, even if only virtually.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jing Ke
To slay with this dagger, I'm still a little far.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jing Ke
So, I will go one step closer.

...Of course.[sr]Soldiers rushed to his rescue.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
Only unarmed civil servants were around the first emperor, but I can't expect such a good situation every time.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Jing Ke
Then, let's start slaying them.[sr]As fast as possible. From now on speed is everything.
