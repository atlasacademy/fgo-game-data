I'm not getting anywhere with my analysis, but I have[sr]news. There's something very similar to Nursery Rhyme nearby.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That army of books was similar to her,[sr]but this is more like an exact copy.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This might be what pulled you into that space.[sr]Can you try talking to it?

I got a detailed analysis now that you're closer[line 2][sr]Yup, Mash is right. Their magical energy response is identical.

[communicationCharaFace 3]

It's too identical.[sr]Like another copy of the same being?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I want to say that's impossible,[sr]but where you are, in a way, is inside Nursery Rhyme.

[communicationCharaFace 5]

It's possible that her core is split[sr]into two beings!

[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But the Ascension gave her the form of a little girl.[sr]That self-contradiction grew within her.

So she called [%1], her Master,[sr]deep inside her.

The book Nursery Rhyme is uncertain.[sr]The girl Nursery Rhyme wants to reject it.
