＠Nero
Umu![sr]My Rome is alive and full with people as ever today!
[k]

＠Nero
We no longer face the threat of the United Empire, smiles have been back on Rome's, my dear Romans' faces.
[k]

＠Nero
How wonderful. I'm in a great mood today.[sr]Indeed[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Nero
It's sad I won't see [%1] and Mash[sr]ever again, but I'm the emperor of Rome!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Nero
As long as my people have smiles on their faces, all I need is to reign over and govern Rome with unlimited love!
[k]

＠Nero
My talent has no limit, and neither does my love.[sr]The applause of roses will always resound in Rome!
[k]

＠Nero
I'm so excited![sr]Which song should I sing today?
[k]

＠Romans
Oh, I see her Imperial Majesty over there![sr]She's as bright as Apollo, and as beautiful as Venus!
[k]

＠Romans
Long live her Majesty![sr]Hurray for Emperor Nero Claudius!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Nero
Umu.[sr]Keep on, I'll allow for the applause.
[k]

＠Nero
If there's one thing to be added, I'm also as talented in art as a Muse.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Nero
Now let me sing![sr]Young girls, come here and hold flowers!
[k]

＠Nero
Honor of Imperium is here! I'll sing with my sweet[sr]voice to people throughout the capital, no, the whole land of Rome.
[k]

＠Romans
Oh, wow![sr]Look, her Imperial Majesty is about to sing!
[k]

＠Romans
We're blessed, but you have to put up with it![sr]Don't lose your concentration, otherwise you won't last!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Nero
Hehe, even the people passing by are excited![sr]I'm so happy. This is the Rome I love!

[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Nero
But those orchestra folks that rushed to join.[sr]Isn't their performance a bit too loud?
[k]

＠Nero
Didn't it drown out my sweet voice and block my singing from reaching my people?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Nero
I understand that they get excited, but I need them to remember to be patient.

Oh, my Knight Burrus.[sr]What's the matter?
[k]

＠Burrus
From the provinces ruled by the United Empire, we've received letters from the viceroys and director-generals who went missing.
[k]

＠Burrus
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'd appreciate it if you can read it.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Nero
Umu, Burrus.[sr]What you just brought in is nothing less than good news!

Hand over their letter to me.[sr]I've been concerned about them.

It's already late at night.[sr]You should rest soon.

＠Nero
Oh, Seneca.[sr]Hehe, thank you for caring for me.

[charaFace E 4]

I got a stack of official work to deal with. I wish there[sr]were a few more of me so it wouldn't take this much time.

But that wouldn't work either.[sr]For I am the one and only in Rome!

Hehe. It's okay.[sr]I'm glad to hear you say that to me.

I've noticed my migraines are coming back.[sr]Indeed this prevents me from finishing my work.

Certainly, I think I'm a little tired.[sr]I'm going to bed now.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

...Can I ask you to sleep by my side, private tutor?
[k]

＠Seneca
Please stop kidding.[sr]But I'm glad you changed your mind.
[k]

＠Seneca
Please rest well.[sr]You are our only Roman Emperor.
[k]

＠Seneca
You should never push yourself too hard.[sr]Your recklessness will lead to Rome's recklessness.

With such a tiny body, the fragile girl tries to support everything in the far-off land, Rome.

I, Rome, witnessed love in her.[sr]It's not gods' love, and yet not human's love, either.
[k]

It is exactly... One of many forms[sr]of love a Roman emperor ought to possess.

Right. In several years from now Emperor Nero's[sr]political power becomes weak, and she loses the support of everyone under her.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]

I cannot tell her the truth,[sr]but sadly, it's just how the history is.
