＠Jeanne Alter
I was born in a dark abyss, devoid of any light.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I know why I was made.[sr]Ugh, what awful taste in women.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I don't remember who said it...but a voice echoed in my mind... “Vengeance is sweet.”
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
...But I lost. And from that moment,[sr]nothing held any meaning for me anymore.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Not my existence.[sr]Not my life.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Not my mind.[sr]Not even the concept that is me.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
And that's why I need to start over from the very beginning.

...The Avenger is the most unusual of them all.
[k]

＠???
The Ruler class has the unusual responsibility of regulating a Holy Grail War. However, you might say the very existence of the Avenger Class is unusual.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠???
What's more, her existence in particular is something of a peculiar one, born as she was of the omnipotent wish granter, the Holy Grail...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠???
By basing her existence on a hero named Jeanne d'Arc, Jeanne Alter was accepted by the world.
[k]

＠???
What was her second birth like?[sr]Well, that's a story for another day. In any case...
[k]

＠???
She probably cannot stand the fact that her existence is based and depends on Jeanne d'Arc.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠???
To Jeanne Alter, even if her existence is like an ephemeral dream, a mere bubble... No, perhaps it is BECAUSE she knows how fragile her existence is...
[k]

＠???
She attempts to use her own strength alone to keep afloat, so to speak.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

I am at a loss for words. She might be an Alter, but she's every bit as serious and stubborn as her other self.
