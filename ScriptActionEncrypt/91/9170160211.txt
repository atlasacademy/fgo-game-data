＠Tamamo Cat
You're pretty good with that lobster, Mash.[sr]I'm sure you'd make a pretty handy wife in the kitchen.
[k]

＠Mash
W-Wife![sr]No...well...uh...I have no experience in cooking...

＠Tamamo Cat
Cooking and fighting are very similar![sr]They both smell of blood, and are both just as exciting.
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
The greater the battle with the ingredients, the better it[sr]tastes. It's the same in relationships too. The one who wins gets to eat!

＠Mash
Oohh... That's an interesting take.[sr]Very informative. Please tell me more, Professor Cat.

＠Tamamo Cat
When our spirits become filled with gloom, we lose sight[sr]of ourselves. This is a slumberer's paradise, between dawn and dusk[line 3]

＠Tamamo Cat
It's the physical manifestation of a pretty frightening[sr]tale, but I guarantee that it's easy to use. So go ahead and use it.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Tamamo Cat
Master, from now on I'd like you to handle me with caution. Be strict, but sweet and sometimes gentle, all right?
