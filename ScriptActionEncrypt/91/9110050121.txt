I have unfortunate news, Your Majesty.[sr]Please look inside.

＠Nero
Hey[line 3]There's nothing in here? Is this a...pelican?
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
...I'm not sure.[sr]It looks like a penguin to me.
[k]

？1：Looks like someone beat us here.

？2：Guess it was too good to be true.

？！

＠Nero
This sucks![sr]But it wasn't such a waste of time after all!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Nero
If you look closely, there's some stuff left in here.[sr]Whoever came before us must be a careless fool!

Okay, we're going to take this and have a triumphant[sr]return! Good work [%1], Mash.

Um... Well, that's fine, but why?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I don't see why an emperor would really need any treasure.
[k]

＠Nero
...Umu, with my Golden Rule I wouldn't have to[sr]worry about money, but I need more capital right now.
[k]

？1：More capital?

？2：For what reason?

？！

[charaFace C 1]
＠Nero
That's a secret, of course![sr]You'll find out eventually, so look forward to it!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...You heard her, Senpai.[sr]It seems that Her Majesty has some sort of grand plan.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Anyway, let's collect some resources that we might be[sr]able to use. There's some Saint Quartz!
