＠Da Vinci
(Sigh) Dammit, Salaì...[sr]I heard you died five years after I did.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Why'd you have to go and do that while you[sr]were still so young? What a damned waste.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Even if it was just bad luck that led you to[sr]the Holy Grail and turned you into a ghost...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...you have no business dying while you're so young.

？1：Da Vinci...
？2：You probably wanted to have a real talk with him, huh?
？！

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
Hmm, I don't know about that. Sure, he ended up an evil, rampaging ghost...but I think that suited him, in an odd sort of way.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
What better way for a hellion like him to cause as much trouble as he wants, after all.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
In that sense, we were lucky to meet him like this.

Hey, now! No getting all gloomy on me![sr]If Da Vinci says it's okay, then it's okay!

＠Da Vinci
I do like that sensitive side of yours, though.[sr]I hope that's something you can hold on to. Always.

...Hey, Maestro?

...You held a proper funeral for your mother, right?[sr]So why aren't you doing anything this time around?

Yup. I get the feeling that's[sr]what Salaì was telling me.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I know he wasn't ACTUALLY saying anything,[sr]of course. But that's still the impression I got.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This wasn't a prediction or anything like that.[sr]Just a feeling.

...I swear.

＠Da Vinci
That little imp never did have any problem saying the sort of things no one else would dare to.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But you know, Salaì...even if I couldn't give you a proper funeral, I still feel like I gave you a proper send-off.
[k]

Even if I'm the only one who feels that way.

Well, getting my spare ready, really.

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
No telling when my number could be up,[sr]so I've got to be sure I'm ready for anything.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That's probably part of the reason why Salaì showed up now. Demons have long been harbingers of death.

Holmes probably already has an idea of what I'm up to...but I don't see him having an issue.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He may always play it pretty close to the chest, but he had my back again with this, and he kept his mouth shut when he should have.

You'd probably have a big problem with it, wouldn't you? Well, sorry. I've just got to go through with it.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Lady Luck has been awfully kind[sr]to me in this life and in the last.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So to make up for that...even if my next death does turn out to suck pretty badly...
