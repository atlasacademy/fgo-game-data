A life-or-death situation suits you, Cú Chulainn. Both your eyes are burning brightly, aren't they?

＠Cú Chulainn
That battle was intense, how can I not get excited? My love for a good fight has always been a bad habit of mine since childhood.

＠Scáthach
Didn't I teach you not to swing your spear with strength alone? Your habit of skipping out on lessons was one thing I couldn't fix...
