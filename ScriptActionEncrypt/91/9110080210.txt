Is it Fafnir again[line 2]?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Siegfried
No, that dragon was completely destroyed.[sr]Please rest assured.
[k]

＠Siegfried
But when the dragon revived, so did my lost Noble Phantasm. We must return to France and secure it[line 2]

I can confirm that, as well.[sr]Hang on while I find the shortest route.

Have you never heard of the Rheingold?

＠Dr. Roman
The Rheingold[sr]...The treasure you obtained.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I've heard it's a mountain of treasures that couldn't be exhausted even by all the people of the era.

＠Siegfried
That's an exaggeration.[sr]But it's enough to allow me, my children[line 2]
[k]

＠Siegfried
and even my grandchildren to grow old in luxury and still have some left over.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Siegfried
It's likely an aftereffect of Fafnir's resurrection.[sr]The Rheingold has been summoned, as well.
[k]

＠Siegfried
There's evil surrounding the gold.[sr]If we don't secure it, there will be trouble.

＠Mash
Trouble how?
[k]

＠Siegfried
For example... Suppose a man finds it. With one[sr]glance, the treasure would captivate him completely.
[k]

＠Siegfried
The captivated man would naturally spend the treasure.[sr]Once he did, he would become known as its owner.
[k]

＠Siegfried
Eventually, everything around him[line 2]will be drawn into a bloody struggle.[sr]The battle will drag on and spread like fire, without end.
[k]

＠Siegfried
In the end, the nation will be consumed by atrocities and executions, treachery and perfidy.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Siegfried
That's what Rheingold is.[sr]I regret having ever summoned it...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Understood. We need to prevent that[sr]from happening. Let's hurry to the location!
