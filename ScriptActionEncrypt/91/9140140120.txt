Whew! That was good exercise![sr]By the way, can we eat them?

Probably not a good idea to eat the Lamia...

[charaFace D 4]
＠Ushiwakamaru
A shame. If you carefully drain them of[sr]blood, snakes can be quite delicious.

I used to eat them all the time during war.

Is it strange to want to know about one's Master?

Is my reason that strange?

[charaFace D 4]
＠Ushiwakamaru
I fought for my brother's sake, but he[sr]never believed me, even until the end.

It's true that there were misunderstandings, but I[sr]never thought of hurting him even once[line 2]

I'm not angry. It's just strange to me.[sr]Why can't people understand how I feel?

I'm sorry. This isn't something[sr]I should be talking about with you.

...You're a lot like Ise Yoshimori, you know?

Oh, I don't mean that you look like him.[sr]He had a face like a wicked fox.

[charaFace D 1]

But he was easy to talk to.[sr]About serious things, or just joking around.

You have many Servants. But you take time[sr]to talk to them one-on-one[line 2]

Until you can stabilize that area, even if you[sr]try to return, you'll just end up somewhere else.

The cause of the instability circles around the island. Any ideas?
