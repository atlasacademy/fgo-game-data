It is not that I dislike them or get nervous around them.[sr]I simply do not care for them. Who does this writer think they are, ridiculing me in such a fashion!?

Grrr, I knew it. Just thinking about[sr]what it says makes me see red...!

[charaFace B 5]

＠Wu Zetian
And here is the real problem. It is clear that whoever sent this letter does not like me.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Evidently, it is not enough for the writer to insult me. They claim a desire to settle things with me, and include coordinates telling me where to meet them.

？1：Me? Why!?
？！

[charaFace B 4]

＠Wu Zetian
Oh, right. You could not read it, so you could not see that it explicitly says to come with you.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Perhaps they wish for you to[sr]attend as a witness to our duel.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
While I am loathe to comply with the directions of this foul criminal, I cannot hope to exact justice upon them if I do not do as they say.

Oh, do not worry. Once the culprit is revealed,[sr]that will be the end of it.

＠Wu Zetian
By the time I am through punishing them for their unforgivable first-degree crime of “dissing” me...
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
...they will wish they had never so much as thought to write that letter! Keh heh heh...!

As usual, I'm afraid I don't have a good answer for you about whether Fou is a cat or not...

So...whoever wrote the letter told you to meet them somewhere inside Chaldea?
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
No, they did not.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mash
Then...what are we doing here?

＠Mash
Given how upset you were, I thought we would be storming the meeting place immediately...

Then you thought wrong.[sr]I am neither impetuous nor impulsive.

＠Wu Zetian
I may be noble, but I am not like those other foolish emperors who have their nobility and nothing else.

I only mean that I am both calm and collected,[sr]as any good ruler must be.

＠Wu Zetian
The first order of business in any endeavor is to solidify your position...in other words, to gather information.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
I'm not sure I would describe how you were acting earlier as “calm and collected”...

Indeed. It would be the height of foolishness to enter the enemy's domain without a plan when we have plenty of time to prepare.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
First, we shall discover the identity of this the letter's impudent author, or at least obtain a hint that may end up saving us some time.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
If we should end up coming face-to-face with this villain while investigating their identity, well, that is quite all right with me.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
After all, it is not a fight with this person that I desire. Instead, I want the quickest possible route to giving them the punishment they so richly deserve!
[k]

？1：So, where are we headed now then?
？！

[charaFace B 0]

＠Wu Zetian
Keh heh heh. Between this style of Chinese from my original time period, and this handwriting I am unfamiliar with, this accursed letter is itself a veritable treasure trove of information.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
As you know from how you could not make heads nor tails of it, there are precious few people here who could have written such a letter.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
That, in turn, makes it very easy[sr]to narrow down our list of suspects!
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
In fact, we are heading towards the first of them as we speak. This letter was written with a brush, after all!
