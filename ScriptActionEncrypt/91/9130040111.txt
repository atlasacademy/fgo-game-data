The Hero of Benefaction... I heard he even offered his armor when someone begged for it, even though it was his flesh and blood.
[k]

？1：Flesh and blood?
？2：Armor?

？！

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Yes, as long as he's wearing that gold armor no one can harm him.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He's a hero who relinquished even that precious armor when asked for it.

He is noble and aloof, yet engages with others as his peers[line 3] He is truly a model hero.
