I synchronized with the chain and incorporated it back to my Spirit Origin. At the same time, a part of Kingu's Spirit Origin came flowing into me.

Maybe one day,[sr]Kingu may manifest in my Spirit Origin.

＠Enkidu
My Presence Detection doesn't sharpen one's mind.[sr]It's a subsystem that allows me to become one with the world and identify anything out of place.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Now that I have inherited the legacy and story of Kingu,[sr]I am now able to further integrate myself into anything connected to Chaldea's world.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Now I can melt my very existence into the world. Even if only for an instant, I may be able to evade an enemy's attacks.
[k]


？1：The power that was inherited from Kingu...
？2：What an amazing power!

？！

＠Enkidu
Whether it can actually be used would probably depend on how much my Spirit Origin has bonded with Chaldea and Master.

Either way, the issue here has been corrected.[sr]Let's return to Chaldea, Master.

I'm sure the people will be fearful. They might be afraid that I may take Gil's soul to the underworld on some adventure.

？1：The people of Uruk aren't that fragile.


[charaFace A 1]
＠Enkidu
Really? I see... Then there really[sr]isn't any reason for me to see him.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Gil became a king who made his citizens strong...
[k]

＠Enkidu
And that knowledge alone is as good[sr]as meeting Gil and speaking with him.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Yeah. But then again, if the people of Uruk are that resilient, maybe I really would take Gil off on an adventure without having to worry.

This entire planet is his garden. But Gil isn't the sort of person who would be satisfied with just a stroll through something already his.
[k]

＠Enkidu
The moment he finishes walking every inch of this[sr]planet, he'll probably head out into space.
[k]

？1：I don't think he would have a spaceship...

[charaFace A 1]
＠Enkidu
Haha, who knows? That treasury of his is a miniaturized version of human history. Whether such a vehicle is within it is up to how curious he is.

I'm not so sure if it was all right for me to have incorporated Kingu into my humble Spirit Origin...

Or perhaps it would be better to allow Kingu[sr]to take over as the Heroic Spirit for this body.

Gods create. Humans form connections. And they all go back to the ground. That is the duty and inevitable end of all who walk upon this world.

If you say that Kingu was human, why wouldn't YOU be able to say you are human too, since you were all born from the same source, hmm?

Kingu's soul came from Tiamat, and he was able to forge many connections with humans in the Singularity.

The software that was used was the only thing that was different, but there's hardly any distinction between the way the two of you lived your lives.

＠Enkidu
What matters is not why I was created, but how I interact with others, how I live, and how all of that connects...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Enkidu
A long time ago, before I met Gil or Shamhat, or even before I was among the animals in the forest...I had an encounter with someone else.
[k]

＠Enkidu
But I couldn't make any connections. I simply returned the gods' creation back to the land and soil.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Once more...if I can meet this soul one more time,[sr]I may be able to create a connection for her story.

[charaFace A 3]

I'm glad I was able to hear from people like[sr]you...who were created to act a certain way.
