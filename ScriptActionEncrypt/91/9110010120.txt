＠Altria
Just as I thought, she has potential. Mash will become a fine warrior, [%1].

...Then again.[sr]We still need to work on her fear on the battlefield.

＠Mash
...I'm sorry.[sr]Battles are scary, after all.

Aren't you scared, Saber? I mean, you're around[sr]the same age as me, and you're a girl too[line 3]

＠Dr. Roman
Yes, I'm curious about that myself.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It was a surprise to learn that the legendary King Arthur was a girl[line 3]but what really surprised me was your strength.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
I think the quality of Saber's... Altria's Spirit Origin is top-class even among Heroic Spirits.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Altria, King Arthur rather,[sr]why are you so free of doubt?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You went so far as to disguise yourself as a man to take[sr]the throne, unite a ravaged Britain, and drive off invaders.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
What were your reasons to go to such lengths, and what series of events forced you into that position.

...What reasons and events you say? Let me see.[sr]I can explain the series of events, if not the reasons.

＠Altria
I was born to eliminate the previous king, a foolish ruler...[sr]Rather, I was created for it.
[k]

＠Altria
I believe it's a type of magecraft called "conceptual fertilization."
[k]

＠Altria
Mother was pregnant with the concept of the Red Dragon, guardian of Britain, and gave birth to me.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Altria
The high quality of my Spirit Origin is likely a result of[sr]that. Afterwards, I drew the sword that selects kings.
[k]

＠Altria
Having been chosen by the sword, I was saved by Merlin, my guardian as well as a weird mage.
[k]

＠Altria
I was then entrusted with the sacred sword by the Lady of the Lake, and came to rule Britain.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Altria
That is the long and short of my past.[sr]Just like the legends.
[k]

＠Altria
What may differ slightly from your preconceptions is my gender, I suppose.
[k]

＠Altria
I mean. When it comes to ruling a country,[sr]being a man made certain things easier.
[k]

？1：Wasn't that hard on you?

？2：Do you regret it?

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Altria
Of course. It was difficult, and I had many failures.[sr]Like anyone, my life had its ups and downs.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Altria
Nevertheless, I am satisfied with my life.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Altria
I lost my way many times, but in the end, I finally understood.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Altria
Although I have hurt many, and failed to recognize many, I protected that which I held most dear to until the very end.

Master, your commands. Let us lift some small[sr]part of the curse that infects this land!
