＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
For example...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Yes, once upon a time... there was a girl.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
A heaven-sent girl born to the gods Kitano-Tenjin and Gozu-Tenno.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
After staying in her mother's womb for 3 years and 3 months, she was born in the year, day, and hour of the Ox.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
The girl, named Ushi Gozen, was born with fangs, long hair, and eyes that shone like the morning sun.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
In other words, an oni's child had been born in the capital.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...
[k]


？2：Oni's child?

[charaFace G 5]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
That was what they called children born with odd appearances in ancient Japan.
[k]

？！


＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Since she's an oni's child and not regarded as a human, her father, a samurai, ordered people to have her killed...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
But her mother took pity, and left her at a temple in the distant land of Yamato.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Raised in secrecy, the girl grew stronger than any human, having strength of a god.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Naturally, for she was a demigod, as shown by Kitano-Tenjin in a dream when the mother conceived the child.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
The girl grew up not knowing this. Only that her father was a renowned samurai in the capital.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
And so, at age 15, a messenger from the capital came to the temple.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
The messenger spoke. The father wished the girl to return.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Overjoyed, she returned to the capital.[sr]...And there, she was given a new name.

And then, eventually, amidst the battles...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
She realized she had trusted friends and a loving family, a younger brother, next to her.
[k]


？1：Raikou's Four Heavenly Kings!
？2：Is Kintoki the younger brother?

？！

[charaFace G 3]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Comrades. Family. There really was...[sr]Nothing else that could equal them.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
However... One day, the girl had a thought.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Was there meaning in her distinguished service?[sr]Wasn't it all for naught?
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Her comrades praised her. Her students showed her dazzling smiles, too.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Still. Once born an oni's child...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Could she ever truly lead the Genji?[sr]Would she be truly accepted?
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
By her father, by those of her house, by the people of the city. By the humans...
[k]


？1：That's...

[charaFace G 4]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...She was afraid. Though she was stronger than anyone.
[k]


？2：Her father accepted her, didn't he?

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Did he? Not only was she born a woman, she was also an oni's child.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
If only she'd been a man, a genuine human... How much better it would have been... That was her thought.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
She understood that she was oblivious in that quiet country temple.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
By staying in the human crucible of the capital for even a short while, she realized how they feared anything strange.
[k]

？！

[charaFace G 5]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...The girl decided. She would now live up to her father's expectations.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
To escape her days of fighting traitors and move onto the center stage of history.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
And to do that... She would have to kill herself.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
She tried to cut loose her demonic nature and deformity, along with her former name.
[k]


？1：...Ushi Gozen.

？！

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...Yes.

＠Sakata Kintoki
The area around the Asakusa River is empty wilderness. Why would a Genji general leave the capital to go there?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Even onis and spiders don't go out there.[sr]And then there's you.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
You've been acting weird lately.[sr]How to put it... Almost absent-minded...
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
You just look at me in a daze, frozen, at least twice or thrice a day. It's weird.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Weird...?
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Nothing's changed about me. Your mother's still the next leader of the Genji clan, who still loves you.

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
And so...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
In Azuma-no-Kuni, far from the capital, the girl fought against herself. At first, through deep meditation.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
After an intense battle, the demonic nature within her... Ushi Gozen was finally awakened.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
She separated from the girl's body, manifesting as an incarnation of Gozu-Tenno.
[k]


？1：She really split into two people?

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Yes. And so began their battle to the death.
[k]


？2：The clone technique...


[charaFace G 1]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Oh, I know of that. It's, you know, what ninjas use in stories from the generations born after me, right?
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
No, this was different. A single girl, completely divided in two...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
And then fighting to the death.
[k]

？！

[charaFace G 5]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Ushi Gozen manifested truly as a ravaging demigod.[sr]The skies blew, lightning crashed, the earth split.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
In order to kill it, she and her comrades attacked “herself.”
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...It truly was a foolish act.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
And the foolish girl finds out. The foolish conclusion of one who could only see herself.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Behaving without consideration for others, injuring her beloved child...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Making the child she least wanted to sadden feel so much sadness...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...(Sniff)
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Mother has never regretted anything as much as that. Such a sad, sad...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Nothing is worse than that. Honestly...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
That's why... I never want you to feel that...
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...Oh? [%1]?
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Well, you've fallen asleep. In the middle of my lesson. Bad child.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Still... Perhaps this is for the best.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
You ended up not seeing my embarrassing tears.[sr]That would have made the lecture pointless.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Heh, how adorable you look asleep.[sr]So defenseless. I want to poke your cheeks.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I almost want to hug you tight and use you as a pillow.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
But... You're tired from your late training.[sr]I'll refrain from my selfishness.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

With that, for tonight, have a good night, [%1].

Yeah, you definitely fell asleep![sr]You're asleep now!

[charaFace F 1]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Yup, exactly like I hoped.
[k]

？！

[charaFace F 7]
＠Sakata Kintoki
It's where a Master and Servant are linked in a dream. This is a dream. A really dangerous dream.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Although, it's not my dream.[sr]Well, maybe I've dreamed about this...
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Sakata Kintoki
But this is Boss Raikou's dream.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
And we're nearly at the scene where the Ushi-Oni, some of the most formidable enemies in her stories, show up.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
The Ushi-Oni are pretty strong enemies, but this is the biggest of the big ones!
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Ushi Gozen... The manifestation of Raikou's demonic side.
[k]


？1：The one I've heard so much about.
？2：If you're here with me, Kintoki, then...

？！

[charaFace F 7]
＠Sakata Kintoki
When this happened in the past, I stopped it.[sr]Well, kinda stopped it, but it turned out all right.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Boss Raikou, you see... tried to kill her demonic side, which manifested as Ushi Gozen.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Old story, she got her priorities backwards.[sr]You can cut part of yourself away, but it's still you.
[k]

[charaFace F 7]
＠Sakata Kintoki
What happens if you kill yourself? You die, right?
[k]


？1：She... tried to kill herself?

？！

[charaFace F 7]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Yeah. She was worrying and suffering all by herself.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Sakata Kintoki
She chose to die as a human by killing the oni side of herself.
[k]

[charaFace F 7]
＠Sakata Kintoki
I objected. Despite her screaming, despite her cries for me to let her die.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Did I tell you what happens after that?[sr]I beat up Raikou and stopped the fight.
[k]


？1：You told me before.

[charaFace F 0]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Right. Well, that's how it went.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Ushi Gozen vanished.[sr]We never saw her again.
[k]


？2：Maybe I didn't hear it.

[charaFace F 7]
＠Sakata Kintoki
It's not something I like to talk about...[sr]Anyway, I stopped Raikou from killing herself.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Screaming at her, telling her not to be a fool.[sr]Down on my knees begging her, pathetically sobbing.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
In the end, Ushi Gozen surrendered.[sr]She willingly got hit by my lightning and passed out.
[k]

[charaFace F 7]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Literally stunned herself. Ushi Gozen hasn't appeared since.
[k]

？！

[charaFace F 0]
＠Sakata Kintoki
But, this time things are going differently.[sr]You need to fight her. As Raikou's Master.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
To see if you can accept Minamoto-no-Raikou, you must confront Ushi Gozen, the one usually dormant within her!
[k]


？1：I had a feeling about that!

？！

＠Ushi Gozen
You're just a human. Hearing you'll save the world,[sr]I wondered how much of a monster...
[k]

＠Ushi Gozen
...a hero with demon blood you would be, yet you're merely a child with slight knowledge of sorcery.

Raikou is a troublesome one as well. Since we can't choose our parents, we should at least choose our children.

I think nothing. Hee hee hee.

＠Ushi Gozen
No way humans and oni can understand each other.

You're honest. Well, I doubt you would understand.
