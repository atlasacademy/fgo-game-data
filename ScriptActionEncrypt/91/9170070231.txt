...Impressive, dragonkin. As a creature that possesses part of my name, you truly were a worthy opponent.

？1：It's the opposite, my lord.

I suppose we've managed to improve my name's ill repute here.

＠Vlad III
A mysterious hero who saved London from a dragonkin... Not bad. Not bad at all...

Even that Saint George[line 2]Georgios[line 2]has made a hobby of it. That surely means it is not something that would give offense to God.

Do not worry. Even if it were, nobody would know what kind of photo it was anyway.

It is destined to turn to dust someday, much like that dragonkin we just defeated.

＠Vlad III
Let us return to Chaldea, Master. I appreciate you accompanying me on my endless journey to fulfill my desires.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Vlad III
It may be futile. It may all be in vain.[sr]It may be a meaningless and ludicrous journey.
[k]

＠Vlad III
But such a thing is not to be fought. It is not in my nature to be abashed.

And. While I savor all of these endeavors...

I simply cannot take pride in the fact that I am a vampire. Not ever.
