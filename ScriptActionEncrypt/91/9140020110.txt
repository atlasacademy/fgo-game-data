Hrm... What is this wasteland?

＠Iskandar
I came along excited about the prospect of a new battle, but this place is cold and bare.

Really? I thought the great King of Conquerors who trampled the Persian desert would find this place nostalgic.

Fool. The glorious battlefields of my memories were blazing gold at day and like tranquil moonlight at night. A sea of sand so mystical, it roused the heart.

It's nothing like this empty bore of a ruin.[sr]It's vastly different in epicness and scale.

Wouldn't you say an empty plain like this is rather convenient for battle, since you don't need to worry about harming innocent bystanders?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Iskandar
Convenient!? If it's not a fruitful land that gets the heart pumping, how do you know what you're fighting for!

...I see. I expect nothing less from you, Senpai. You have summoned yet another troublesome Heroic Spirit.

Now, now. There's no need to be so pessimistic.

In order to have a harmonious relationship with Servants, a positive outlook on things is most important, Mash.

Are you saying that you have no problem controlling Servants, no matter how extraordinary of a Heroic Spirit they are?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Perhaps that's just your positive thinking talking? ...To be honest, I'm a little concerned about your optimism...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
No. In a situation as desperate as this, confidence and optimism are our ultimate weapons.

King of Conquerors. You seem unimpressed with the world you've been summoned to, but why not think of it this way?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The crisis of destruction we are facing right now has the potential to make every land of this world into barren wastelands.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Which means the enthralling land that you seek to conquer will no longer be if nothing is done.

You are not wrong to think so. To be honest, we do not fully understand the enemy ourselves.

No matter what it may be, as long as it has a physical body that bleeds when I cut it, I'll have no problem fighting.
