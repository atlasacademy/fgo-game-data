Remember, we're up against the Achaean army.

＠Hektor
They're sparing no effort to invade Troy and take back Helen after my little brother, Paris, abducted her, and they're totally in the right to do so.
[k]

＠Hektor
They've even got the gods' blessing...though we do have some gods on our side, too.
[k]

＠Hektor
And then there's all the heroes they've got[sr]who're as strong as gods in their own right.

Agamemnon, Odysseus, Patroclus, the two Ajaxes...
