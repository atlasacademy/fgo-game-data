Hmm. I trust you've heard the[sr]word “breakthrough” before?

[charaFace C 5]

＠Nikola Tesla
While it's commonly used to refer to formerly impossible things becoming possible, or limits being surpassed...
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
...those are merely evolutionary steps. Living creatures naturally take such steps over the course of their lifetime.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
A true breakthrough happens when obstacles hindering technology or a civilization's development cease to be an obstruction.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
“It will take decades for this breakthrough to come to fruition.” “This is simply not possible with our current technology.”
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
Problems like that have appeared throughout all of human history. One could even consider them the will of God attempting to hold back mankind's evolution.

[charaFace C 0]

But now and then, someone special will manage a breakthrough with currently available technology and resources alone.
[k]

From then on, the knowledge they gained from overcoming that obstacle becomes something shared with the rest of humanity.

＠Nikola Tesla
These people are known as pioneers in[sr]recognition of their achievements...

＠Nikola Tesla
...for they are the ones who paved the way for the expansion of humanity's knowledge beyond its limits.

In brief, I suppose you could say they are[sr]people who made the impossible possible.

Of course, that's much easier said than done. A real breakthrough is an incredible feat, and most people who managed one were mocked mercilessly by laymen.

They were dismissed as mere eccentrics with delusions of grandeur for thinking they could succeed at something everyone else knew to be impossible.
