Thanks to its cutting-edge optical instruments and interconnected network, it is possible to observe the stars in ways that were never before possible.

What's more, there are skilled technicians here who are deeply versed in the ways of magecraft.

[charaFace G 0]

...And yet, there is harmony and discord among the stars that even they cannot see.

Even now, there is an almost imperceptibly slight disturbance in the relationship between Saturn and the sun, the two celestial bodies that are supposed to comprise Capricorn.
[k]

Of course, there is not enough wisdom in the world to perfectly predict the movements of the stars...

[charaFace C 4]
Yes... I know she gets my name wrong sometimes.
[k]

＠Queen of Sheba
And that it has to do with her[sr]memories from when she was alive.
[k]

＠Queen of Sheba
Though it does seem like she's been calling[sr]me by the wrong name more often lately.
[k]

？1：What do you make of it?
？2：I can't help but worry a little.
？！

[charaFace C 6]
＠Queen of Sheba
Hmm...
[k]

＠Queen of Sheba
Like I told her earlier,[sr]I don't think it's a cause for concern.
[k]

＠Queen of Sheba
She is surrounded by good friends looking out for her best interests here.
[k]

＠Queen of Sheba
To be perfectly honest, as one of Chaldea's Servants myself, I don't think it's my place to say anything.

[charaFace C 0]
＠Queen of Sheba
Still...if it bothers you,[sr]I suppose there must be a good reason for that.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Queen of Sheba
In which case, as a mage,[sr]and as her contracted Master...
[k]

＠Queen of Sheba
...I believe it falls to you[sr]to step up and help her.
[k]

＠Queen of Sheba
If you're still not sure what to do after giving it your best effort, come talk to me again.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Queen of Sheba
That said, please don't forget about that disturbance with the stars over the last few days, either.
[k]

[charaFace C 8]
＠Queen of Sheba
Good luck, and please be careful, Master...
