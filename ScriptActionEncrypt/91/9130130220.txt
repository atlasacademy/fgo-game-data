Yes. ...But why would Scáthach lure Master to the Land of Shadows?

＠Cú Chulainn
Scáthach is pretty well beyond rational understanding or anything like that.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
From the looks of it, I don't think it's anything serious. She probably got a bit lonely.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
She's been stuck in this land for a few hundred years. There's nobody whom she could fight, let alone hate.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
A long time ago, ambitious fighters like me...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Cú Chulainn
Came over to challenge the famed Scáthach to gain fame and glory, but she beat the crap out of every single one of us.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
...Aaand then we all ended up as her disciples...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
Well, none of us could live forever.[sr]So this situation might be partly our fault.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
What do you mean?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Our mentor trained the crap out of us.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
Every one of us loved women and booze more than anything. We were a bunch of barbarians.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Scáthach would kick us around for being so rowdy, but it must have been fun for her.

“The spirits of the dead would miss no chance to infiltrate the real world, but your ruckus has managed to frighten them away.”

[charaFace B 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
That's what Scáthach would always lament.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
But we all had a place to go home to.[sr]The Land of Shadows was just a stop on our journey.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
And so, Scáthach's disciples all died young.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
...As for me, I turned up as a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
Come to think of it, I guess there was the option where we could have fought Scáthach in the Land of Shadows for eternity.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
But I chose not to. I think she may have resented me for that.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...I don't think that's true.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
Maybe. I was just rambling. Ignore me.
