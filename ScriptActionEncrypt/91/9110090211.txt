...It does seem that way, doesn't it? Do you have any idea what could be bothering her, Master?
[k]

？1：Not for sure, no.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jekyll
I see...[sr]Well, then, there's nothing to be done.
[k]

？2：More or less, but...

＠Jekyll
Oh, right, sorry. It would be rude to ask[sr]you to talk about her when she is not here.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jekyll
Anyway...would you mind talking to her?
[k]

＠Jekyll
Much as she pretends otherwise,[sr]Mordred really does trust you.

＠Mordred
...I wanted to talk about what happened this morning. Did you really have the same dream...?
[k]

？1：Yup, I did.

＠Mordred
Tch, I knew it... I know it's typical for Masters and Servants, but still...
[k]

？2：Nope. By the way, what was the deal with that sword?

＠Mordred
[messageShake 0.01 5 5 1.0]
The hell you tryin' to pull here!?[sr]How else would you know about that!?
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mordred
...That was the Sword of Selection.
[k]

＠Mordred
It confers the right to rule to the one that draws it... Uh, no, more like the one who has the right to rule is the only one actually able to draw it.
[k]

＠Mordred
You know stories about King Arthur drawing a sword from a stone, right? That's the Sword of Selection.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mordred
...I always dreamed about trying that for myself. Think about it: me, drawing the same sword as my old man.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mordred
What better way could there be to[sr]prove I'm worthy of the throne?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mordred
So I dreamed about it. Over and over.[sr]More times than I could count.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mordred
But you know... After all the shit I've been through,[sr]I haven't had that dream in a good while.
[k]


＠Mordred
Don't get me wrong, I haven't given up on being king.[sr]I don't think that wish'll ever really go away.
[k]

＠Mordred
But lately...I haven't really felt overcome with a desire for it or anything. It's almost like a curse had been lifted.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mordred
And that's why I'm wondering why[sr]I'm having that dream again now...
[k]

＠Mordred
Made me sick, honestly. It was like some old regrets were being shoved in my face.
[k]

？1：So, are you scared to go to sleep now?

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mordred
[messageShake 0.01 5 5 0.7]
Huh!? Hell no![sr]Who do you think you're talking to here!?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mordred
Sheesh... Just because you're my Master doesn't mean you can say shit like that!
[k]

＠Mordred
Anyway, that aside...
[k]

？2：I'm here for you.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mordred
...Haha![sr]Right. Course you are.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mordred
They do say Masters and Servants[sr]share the same dreams.
[k]

＠Mordred
...If the shit ever hits the fan, it'll be nice to have your help. Just don't expect me to wait around for you to show up or anything.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_11 0.7]
＠Mordred
...Sorry about this morning.[sr]That's all I wanted to say. I'll get out of your hair now.
