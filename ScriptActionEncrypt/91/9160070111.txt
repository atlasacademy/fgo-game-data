...Whew. Your combat power is as quite good as I expected. Well done.

＠Past Jekyll
Well, I'll be going now.[sr]I'm sure he learned what his limit was after all.

[charaFace E 5]
＠Past Jekyll
Nothing will do you good to be overcome by "Hyde."[sr]Don't forget your original purpose, "myself."
[k]

＠Past Jekyll
Are you going to live a life that would shame Tatsumi?[sr]Think a little, and you'd have figured that out.

Mash, [%1].[sr]Give my regards to Saber and Fran if you see them.

Good-bye[line 3]

＠Dr. Roman
We got the results of the observation.[sr]It shows that his existence itself was unstable.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Demonic Fog remaining in London is not perfect, either, so it wasn't a proper summon or materialization.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
He would have disappeared by himself sometime soon anyway. So, um[line 3]

That killed the mood.[sr]I should probably leave it at that, too.

That part of "me" looked happy when he disappeared.[sr]What the hell was that "learning his limit."

I'll return to Chaldea.[sr]Pardon me for getting you in trouble, Master.

＠Jekyll
It's true I acknowledge that I am also "Hyde." but it wouldn't do any good if my thoughts become too hasty.

[charaFace C 4]
＠Jekyll
...It will, ah, never allow me to achieve anything.

[charaFace C 0]
＠Jekyll
Someday I will resume my battle to control "Hyde" myself. I'm truly sorry, Master, Mash.
[k]

＠Jekyll
I should take no more detour and[sr]start correcting the world now.

[charaFace C 5]
＠Jekyll
...I'll challenge myself to a rematch afterwards.
