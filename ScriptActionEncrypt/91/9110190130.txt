...Well, it seems you pass.[sr]Something is still missing, but that's hardly a surprise.
[k]

＠Arjuna
Of course, any Heroic Spirit would find himself lacking when standing in comparison to me.
[k]

＠Arjuna
Don't you agree?

？1：Well you're not...not entirely...not incorrect...?

[charaFace C 5]

Puzzling...which is it!?[sr]Do you believe it's true, or not?

Ah. That may have been somewhat childish of me.

Rama. You are quite perplexing.[sr]You overcame so many trials in your lifetime.
[k]

＠Arjuna
And, in doing so, you became a full and complete hero.

Had you not been summoned as your youthful self,[sr]these trials now would be unnecessary.

It's possible that I could be summoned as an older king, one who would remember Sita, but had also come to terms with what happened to her.
[k]

＠Rama
Had that version of me been more compatible with Master, it might have been summoned...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

But it appears that this form was best suited to my Master.

And knowing that makes me happy.

It should be all right. Karna and Arjuna were both great and famous heroes.
