＠Altera
...I was waiting.
[k]

＠Altera
I was waiting for you to come [%1].
[k]

？1：Where are we now?

＠Altera
I don't know exactly.
[k]

？2：...Am I, in a dream?

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
Yes.[sr]You have a good intuition, Master.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
I can't be certain, but I can guess to a certain level.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Altera
This is[line 3]"inside of me."
[k]

＠Altera
It's not something physical, but psychological.
[k]

＠Altera
Inside of me. I still can't say that for sure, but it's[sr]my memory. Of me, who fought as the great King of Huns.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
...Inside of the memory of myself "as a hero."
[k]

？1：As a hero?

？2：I don't really get what you mean

？！

＠Altera
It means exactly what I said. The memory of "me,"[sr]who was once called King of Destruction, Attila.
[k]

＠Altera
One who kept on destroying every civilization like a thoughtless, wordless machine.
[k]

＠Altera
It's my memory.[sr]That's why in here...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Altera
...there's nothing.
[k]

[se ad2]
[charaFace C 5]
＠Altera
I didn't think "like a human being."[sr]I didn't feel like one either.
[k]

＠Altera
I couldn't think, and couldn't feel.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
...To you, what do I look like?
[k]

＠Altera
To me, only the sky and the earth stretch endlessly.[sr]It's the end of a star that was leveled with no feeling or purpose.
[k]

＠Altera
To you...I suppose, it looks like a view "closest" to what you've seen.
[k]

＠Altera
How you see it might be different, but this dark wasteland is indeed me.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Altera
Even though I'm supposed to be looking at my memory,[sr]I see nothing. No friends, and no family...
[k]

＠Altera
I can't hear anyone's voice.[sr]Nothing but gusty winds.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Altera
...Heh, talk about empty.
[k]

[seStop ad2 3]
＠Altera
Despite the fact I've led many into battle, how come not even a single person is in my memory.
[k]

？1：I think it's quiet.

？2：This is pretty calming.

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
You're kind.
[k]

＠Altera
Well, I suppose that's how people would call someone like you, kind.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Altera
I never...
[k]

＠Altera
...I never wished to destroy lives. Still, I always kept[sr]destroying civilizations far as the eyes can see.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Altera
You see the contradiction?[sr]I can't help myself from choosing this way.
[k]

＠Altera
I deviate from this planet's absolute principle[line 3][sr]that its purpose of survival is breeding.
[k]

＠Altera
"Destruction" is implanted deep within my heart.[sr]I don't want to willingly kill, but I want to destroy.
[k]

＠Altera
As a result people die. I killed many of them.[sr]The earth was always soaked with blood.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Altera
...However.[sr]What is left for me is this dark wilderness...
[k]

＠Altera
Look[line 2][sr]it's coming.

[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
I said there's nothing, but well, it wasn't true.
[k]

＠Altera
I've got ones like them.[sr]Those who have unclear names, with no faces.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Altera
Those whom I fought against and killed. I simply fought[sr]and killed without recognizing them as individuals.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Altera
Now it's time to use your power, Master. Though[sr]only if that summoning system of your works.
[k]

＠Altera
You have no choice but to fight, if you don't want to die.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
...I'm not sure if death exists in this place, though.
