The town is so peaceful despite the war. There are so many stores open along the main street here. It's a sight for sore eyes.
[k]

？1：You seem to be in a fine mood, Saber.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Saber Lily
Yes. It is true that we are in enemy territory, but it is[sr]still pleasant to observe people going about their daily lives.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Saber Lily
...Admittedly, it does pain me to see France and England at war during this era.
[k]

？2：Want to get something to eat?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Saber Lily
Oh, thank you.
[k]

＠Saber Lily
I appreciate the thought, but for now I am content just to breathe the air here.

[k]

＠Dr. Roman
She's a serious, kind girl,[sr]but we've all seen a different side to her...

[charaFace D 4]
＠Saber Lily
I see...but it's unsettling, isn't it?[sr]That "other self" isn't very nice.
[k]

＠Saber Lily
I mean, if the person in question is my future self, I was hoping to get some advice that might make my life a little easier.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Advice?[sr]Saber, you're still in training, right?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Saber Lily
Yes. Although I chose to walk the path of swordsmanship, I was serving my brother up until this point.
[k]

＠Saber Lily
Now I continue to polish my swordsmanship and broaden my horizons.

...Hey [%1], there's something about[sr]her that's been bothering me for a while now. Can I ask her?

Well then, if I may ...Ahem[sr]Saber, this is a bit of a direct question, but...

What's up with those clothes?[sr]I mean, isn't that skirt kind of short?

＠Saber Lily
Th-These clothes?[sr]I see, indeed...They somewhat concern me as well.
[k]

＠Saber Lily
I am not used to wearing such feminine clothes...[sr]But Merlin suggested it would help mask my identity.

Yes. I weave my own magical energy into armor,[sr]but he told me not to rely on it.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Saber Lily
He said I get to be more reckless now, that I should fight more freely and lightly.
[k]

＠Mash
...I see. One could expect no less from Merlin,[sr]the famed kingmaker.
[k]

＠Mash
True, seeing Saber in her current state, not many could[sr]guess she would one day rule over Britain as the King of Knights.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Saber Lily
R-Really? Someone like me will rule...No, I mustn't show weakness! Of course, I will do everything I can to be worthy of that position.

Hmm, sounds like trouble at the gates. Judging[sr]from the noise, I imagine it's an enemy attack.
