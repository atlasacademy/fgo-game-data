That does it. Hmm.
[k]

＠Altera
I must apologize. It seems my idle chatter has attracted something unnecessary.
[k]

？1：Keep telling us the story.
[charaFace C 1]
＠Altera
...You sure are curious.
[k]

？2：I don't think it's idle chatter.
＠Altera
...Is that so.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
...Okay.
[k]

[wt 0.2]
＠Altera
Then I'll continue. Let me tell you what is inside the vessel shaped as I am.
[k]

＠Altera
I do not feel the emotions[line 2]the sadness, the happiness[line 2]that you people do.
[k]

＠Altera
Instead, there is only destruction.
[k]

＠Altera
All that these hands can do is destroy, shatter, and kill.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Altera
Yet...sometimes I think...
[k]

＠Altera
With these hands that bring nothing but destruction...
[k]

＠Altera
...just like you humans who live honestly on this earth...
[k]

＠Altera
...I want to feel affection.[sr]I want to embrace something, someone.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
I want to acknowledge everything on Earth, not destroy it. I want to gain emotions and become a woman...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Altera
...
[k]

＠Altera
That is what I sometimes think.[sr]That is what I dream.
[k]

＠Altera
Had I chosen a life different than that of a soldier of destruction...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
What would I have become? What would be the makeup of “me”? I could have read books. Sing. Perhaps cooked.
[k]

＠Altera
Or[line 3]

Indeed. That voice is starting to get on my nerves.
[k]

＠Altera
It's time to destroy it.[sr]Master, there's no need to hold back.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
That is me, but it's just me.[sr]Even if that dies, I will not vanish.
[k]

＠Altera
So...
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Altera
So let's destroy it, Master.
