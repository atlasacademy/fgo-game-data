History is a cloth woven from truth and dreams.[sr]At times the truth is too brutal, so we paint over it with our dreams.
[k]

＠Vlad III
...However, there are those who embrace delusions.[sr]They crush the truth, and delight us with deception.
[k]

＠Vlad III
[line 2]That is to say, to be frank, I will not forgive "Dracula."[sr]Not ever.

＠Vlad III
My memories. You see, I was born the second son of[sr]my father, Vlad II, and was ruler of Wallachia.
[k]

＠Vlad III
Although I was driven to misfortune, I have no regrets over my life.

[charaFace D 4]

You're right. The memories of that dreaded vampire.[sr]People I've never seen before glare at me, and try to drive a stake through my heart.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Vlad III
...The hearts of men! They are full of[sr]absurd naivety and incorrigible stubbornness.
[k]

＠Vlad III
They affix imaginary personalities, imaginary[sr]histories, and imaginary stories to reality.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Vlad III
But they have no idea how much trouble those[sr]affected are going through. Therefore, heed my orders.
[k]

＠Vlad III
Travel with me to a different era, and eliminate the[sr]imaginary history. [line 2]It should be easy.
[k]

＠Vlad III
Even imaginings are based on real tales, and those tales have authors.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

We will bring an end to them. It should be easy for us.[sr][line 2]Don't tell me, you're going to say no?

Regardless of the outcome, or how we arrived at it...[sr]Revealing the truth is the right thing to do.

[charaFace A 12]

Yes. At least I think so.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

Once we start tracking Dra...'s footsteps, the place with the highest magical energy response...

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
...will most likely be the origin of Dra...'s legends.

[charaFace A 12]

It's just that... Can the commonly[sr]known legend of Dra... be erased that easily?
