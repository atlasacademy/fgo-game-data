[line 2]We're here, but why are we here?
[k]

＠Atalante
I heard there was a child Servant.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Jack the Ripper.[sr]Yes, she WAS a child... I think.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
To think that's who she really was... What a shock.
[k]

＠Atalante
That's not exactly right. She's simply one aspect of Jack the Ripper.
[k]

＠Atalante
Jack the Ripper is a black box, filled with the beliefs, hypotheses, and ideas of people everywhere.
[k]

＠Atalante
Even without knowing the real killer, as long as you know the name you can summon the appropriate Servant.
[k]

＠Atalante
...In that sense, she's similar to Hassan-i Sabbah.
[k]

＠Atalante
In a normal Holy Grail War, one of almost 20 of them can be summoned via the concept of “Assassin”

＠Mash
You sure know a lot.[sr]I am surprised.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Atalante
I've crossed paths with them.[sr]I hope that child disappears completely...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Huh? She should've disappeared already[line 2]
