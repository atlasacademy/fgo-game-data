Darn it all! The beef got away.[sr]I wanted to become friends.

...I think maybe Asterios only came here[sr]to look for Euryale...

＠Mash
Except, Stheno was the one who lived here.[sr]Well, it's hard to tell them apart...

＠Tamamo Cat
But we've taken the river.[sr]It's time to hunt! I think I'll help myself to a salmon!

You must admit, that salmon was a worthy opponent.[r]With wet scales that sparkle like gems... I can't even!
[k]

？1：Wow! One swipe! You're good at that!

[charaFace D 3]
＠Tamamo Cat
Oh stop it Master! You're making me blush![sr]But that's because salmon hunting is what cats do best!
[k]

？2：You only want one?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Tamamo Cat
Yes. I only take what I need.[sr]That's the nature's code.

＠David
Sorry. But that's your first and final warning. Normally[sr]I'd give you four chances, but this time is special.
[k]

＠David
You're sheep thieves, aren't you?[r]This is the ranch that I've taken great pains to develop.
[k]

＠David
Can you understand? Starting my own ranch has been[sr]my dream, my salvation for all the suffering I went through on the throne.
[k]

＠David
Simply put, I will kill anyone who ruins my dream.[r]Besides, I got a house full of wives to take care of.

It's a mistake. We've only come here to hunt[line 3][sr]Er, I mean... Maybe it's not a mistake?

Hahahahaha! This is the first time we've met.[sr]It's nice to meet you, King of the Sling!

＠David
I don't particularly like that nickname.[r]It makes me sound like I'm some kind of con artist.
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
Anyway, I'm gonna grab a carrot! But before that,[sr]maybe I should turn into a giant, like in the tale?
[k]

＠David
No need. I'm not fighting Goliath again. You there,[sr]beautiful little beast. After I punish you, I'll make you my wife!
