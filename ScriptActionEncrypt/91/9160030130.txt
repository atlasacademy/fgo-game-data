Of course not. The specialty of that persona is not knowing or being able to do anything.
[k]

？1：What does that mean...?
？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Hundred Personas
To know nothing can sometimes[sr]be very useful for an assassin.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
This would be utterly humiliating if it actually happened, but...hypothetically, let's say we failed a mission and the enemy captured us.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
If we had a persona that knows nothing, then no matter how much they were interrogated, they could not reveal anything, because they do not KNOW anything.

We found her wandering the hallway and heard[sr]her story. That's why we brought her here.

＠Nursery Rhyme
That's right. You shouldn't have to do something you don't want to! You shouldn't have to be trapped by a boring and painful fate!
[k]

＠Nursery Rhyme
That's a book you should just leave closed.[sr]That's why we decided to let her stay here.
[k]

＠Nursery Rhyme
Here, her only job is to enjoy drinking tea and chatting.
[k]

＠Nursery Rhyme
...She doesn't talk much, but she is so cute[sr]when she eats snacks! Like a little squirrel!
