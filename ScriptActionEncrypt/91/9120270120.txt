I was hoping the ponytail witch Medea Lily would be the one... But even though she was unconscious, she had really strong magical resistance!

She was the hardest to deal with, despite how she looks. She's probably got a lot more going on than meets the eye.

It's good that you're really into my cause, but quit acting like that, it's gonna end up making things take a bad turn (read: get us shut down).

Okay, next. I went after kiddos last time, so maybe[sr]I should look for a stronger girl this time.

Yoohoo, are there any girl kings swinging their swords around here...?

After I give her a gentle thrashing, I wanna nurse her back to health with the utmost care and tenderness!

It will not be unnecessarily painful... That is, it will be excruciating, even highly traumatic, but that is only because it is necessary.

What cannot be dealt with simply must be amputated. All that is necessary to sustain a patient's life is to keep the vital organs intact.
