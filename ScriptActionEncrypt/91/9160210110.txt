＠Shuten-Douji
Oh my. Perfect timing![sr]Come over here, closer, if you would.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I was just about to look for treats to go along with my drink. Come, sit next to me. Oh don't worry, I won't bite.
[k]

？1：Sure, I guess.

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
Yes, yes. It's good to be honest.[sr]What a good child you are.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Don't be afraid, you can sit closer to me.[sr]...Oh fine, I will sit closer myself, fufufu.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

？2：...This is my room though.

[charaFace C 4]
＠Shuten-Douji
Come on, don't worry about the details.[sr]We have a close relationship, right?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
What was it called?[sr]Master and Servant?
[k]

？！

＠Shuten-Douji
Oh, right. Is the girl with the glasses not with you?[sr]She's always hanging around you...
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I thought she might be your lover,[sr]but I guess I was wrong.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
Well, it doesn't really matter, does it?[sr]Here, have a drink first.
[k]

？1：I'm not old enough to drink.
？2：Water's fine.

？！

[charaFace C 4]
＠Shuten-Douji
Oh my, oh my.[sr]You're no fun.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
The world's full of men who'd love nothing more than for me to pour them a drink.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Are you still afraid of me?[sr]That hurts my maidenly heart.
[k]

？1：Maidenly...heart?

＠Shuten-Douji
...But you know, isn't it a bit dull around here? We can't even go outside to gaze upon the moon, it seems.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
All I'm good for is drinking and appreciating flowers.[sr]You understand why I'd visit you, right?
[k]

？1：You like flowers?

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
Well, my favorite thing is alcohol, followed by flowers, then pretty young men[line 3]
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I don't have a fourth favorite, and fifth is the moon,[sr]I suppose. I like things that please me, and pretty things.
[k]

？2：That's very elegant.

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
Oh, how kind.[sr]But it's not like that.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I don't read poems or write love letters, and being all formal in a palace is just so bothersome.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 4]
＠Shuten-Douji
...Hmm? What's wrong? What's with that look?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
The oni of Mt. Ooe aren't really that special.[sr]I'm just a girl who likes to drink.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I do eat people, I suppose, but I'm not as violent as Ura or Ootakemaru.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
Well, an oni is an oni. I suppose we're not so different in the eyes of humans.
[k]

？1：What exactly did you do before?

[charaFace C 4]
＠Shuten-Douji
Hmm[line 3]
[k]

？2：What kind of oni were you?

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
Fufufufufu. You're going to ask?[sr]Don't blame me if you regret it.

Very well, it's nothing I have to hide.

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_7 2.0]

I suppose, for someone like you, I could tell a couple stories.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_2 0.1]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Shuten-Douji
Where should I begin...
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Can I talk about after I returned to Japan?[sr]My memories before that are fuzzy.
[k]

？1：Before returning?
？2：To Japan?

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
Oh, you didn't know?[sr]Long ago I lived on the continent[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Shuten-Douji
Speaking of which, I don't think I've told anyone about that. No wonder it didn't get passed down.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
Well, it doesn't matter. Anyway, some things happened and I came back to Japan.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I wandered around Kyoto, around the rivers.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
And the next thing I knew I was drinking in a marvelous palace on Mt. Ooe.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
You see, it was Ibaraki... Ibaraki-Douji.[sr]She was considerate and showed me to the oni lair.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Oni were probably the ones who built that palace.[sr]It was quite a sight, up on that mountain.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
After that, I had such a wonderful time.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I drank whenever I desired, and I loved whatever I desired.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I ventured to Kyoto whenever I felt like it, and killed, ate, and plundered, as I pleased.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I took what I liked back to the mountain.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Shuten-Douji
Flowers, the moon, handsome men, pretty women, rare jewels, fabrics, pots... I loved all of them.
[k]

？1：...You killed people?

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
Here and there.
[k]

？2：...It sounds like you had fun.

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
Of course I did.[sr]I'm an oni.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I rampage, love, laugh to my heart's content without a shred of worry or doubt.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
That's what I am, an oni.[sr]Humans like that kind of stuff too, right?
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 4]
＠Shuten-Douji
It was so much fun, but it didn't last long.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
The nobles and onmyouji of Kyoto got very mad.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
They sent the famous Minamoto-no-Raikou, the next head of the Minamoto clan, and Raikou's Four Heavenly Kings after me[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
[line 3]Ah yes, that was a terribly amusing night.
[k]

[wt 0.2]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
I'd been after him for a while. That boy with blonde hair and blue eyes... And then he came for me.
[k]

？1：Sakata Kintoki?

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
Yes, that's right. Him.[sr]The one they called Kintoki.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
It's strange, isn't it? He moved up in the world after he became famous through stories. As if he was a Shogi piece.
[k]

？2：Golden?

＠Shuten-Douji
Right. What's with that? He was a cute kid, and now he's even cuter, you know?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
In life he was reviled for his blonde hair.[sr]Here people just think he's a fan of Western culture.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 3]
＠Shuten-Douji
...Hahh. When I look at his body, I remember.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
If I'd pulled it off that night, I could've put the Red Dragon's ulna in my wine.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
What would it have tasted like, I wonder?[sr]I'd love to drink it.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Shuten-Douji
But that night, they beat me.[sr]They won the fight and killed me.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
They gave me poisoned wine[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
And well, I got drunk, and that was it.
[k]

[wt 0.3]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Shuten-Douji
The divine poisoned wine, Shinpen Kidoku! With an excellent wine like that, of course I'd get drunk!
[k]

？1：...They attacked while you slept, huh?

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
Indeed. I was having a nice nap, and off went my head.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I still remember his face when he did it.[sr]He looked like he couldn't bear with it.
[k]

？2：Does it still bother you?

[charaFace C 3]
＠Shuten-Douji
Huh?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Shuten-Douji
Not really? I'm mostly impressed they managed to do it.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I killed and ate humans.[sr]It's natural that I'd be killed in turn.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
I may be a little ditzy, but I don't forget when I've embarrassed myself.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 4]
＠Shuten-Douji
[line 3]Oh, but... I wish I could've seen those blue eyes once more.
[k]

？1：Looks like you're daydreaming now.
？2：Did you love him?

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
Oh, my. Are you saying that because...
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
You're jealous when I speak of another man?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
Fufufufufu. Instead of fearing the oni of Mt. Ooe, you're getting jealous. You've got guts. I'm impressed.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
...Come, move closer. Why don't I take this chance to teach you a few things?
[k]

？1：Teach me?
？2：What?
