Oh?
[k]

＠
[charaTalk C]According to the child...
[k]

＠
[charaTalk C]
...these bandits had built a hideout nearby,[sr]and struck out from there, raiding nearby villages.
[k]

＠
[charaTalk C]
And since this area was too remote for the authorities to help, there was nothing the villagers could do.
[k]

＠
[charaTalk C]
He also told the man how his brother was killed for daring to fight back...
[k]

＠
[charaTalk C]
...keeping his voice calm and measured all the while.
[k]

＠Man
I see.
[k]

[charaTalk C]
The man had no interest in fighting injustice.

＠
[charaTalk C]
But he knew that if he did nothing, the child would soon end up following in his brother's footsteps.
[k]

＠
[charaTalk C]
He could see the determination in the child's eyes, could see that he was willing to fight the bandits no matter what.

＠
[charaTalk C]
The man had no obligation to help the child,[sr]and no quarrel with the bandits.
[k]

＠
[charaTalk C]...Still...

＠Man
...Do you mean to go kill them yourself?

The truth is that I have no reason to seek vengeance myself. That's why I go around searching for opportunities.

It makes no difference to me if these bandits end up rich, or if a kid ends up throwing his life away.

But, as luck would have it,[sr]our fates have intertwined today.

I will honor that entangling and[sr]serve as a weapon in your stead. I'll be your spear, your fists.
