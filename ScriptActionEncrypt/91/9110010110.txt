This is Fuyuki, birthplace of the Holy Grail War...

Horrible. This flame won't disappear for another 10 or 20 years.
[k]

＠Altria
The curse seeped into the very land itself.[sr]This place is no longer fit for human habitation.

Seems so.[sr]Apparently, there's a similar city in America.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There are fires on the surface, and the ground beneath is full of gas. It is expected to burn another 50 years.

＠Dr. Roman
Well, that was an accident caused by human urban[sr]development. This one is a disaster caused by magecraft.

Disaster by magecraft...[sr]What are your thoughts, Master?
[k]

？1：It's most likely the Holy Grail.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Altria
You believe it's Holy Grail... As much as I don't want to admit it, it's seems undeniable.
[k]

？2：It's because it became a singularity.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Altria
The Holy Grail was not the cause, rather, the very nature of the city was altered by becoming a singularity?

...Excuse me. But it was you who protected[sr]this city's Holy Grail, Saber.
[k]

＠Mash
Or to be more precise, another aspect of you.[sr]Do you have any memories of those events?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Altria
...My apologies.

＠Altria
Heroic Spirits who are summoned to be Servants are separated from their original selves in that moment.
[k]

＠Altria
When released from our contract, we return to the Throne and all our experiences are stored as integrated memories.
[k]

＠Altria
My current self is the "me" from when I conducted myself as the King of Knights, a Saber.
[k]

＠Altria
[%1], Mash, please think of that black armored version of me as an entirely different person.

Yes, that is both a plus and minus of the Heroic Spirit summoning system.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A single Heroic Spirit can employ various facets of itself, but combat between the same Heroic Spirit is also possible.

But rest assured, as long as my dark fallen self belongs to another class I will never change, no matter what happens.
[k]

＠Altria
My sword serves only you and your goal.[sr]It will never attack you even by mistake.
[k]

？1：I'm glad to hear that.

？2：I trust you, of course.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Altria
Right. Thank you Master,[sr]for the time being I shall answer that trust.
