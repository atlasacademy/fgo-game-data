Good question. Here's a hint.

＠Medb
It's something...very sweet.

？1：Sugar?

[charaFace A 13]

Ooh, so close. Yes, sugar is sweet,[sr]but it's not what we're after.

But before we go any further here, let me give you my answer: hell no. I mean, how am I supposed to make kykeon without it?
[k]


＠C：[servantName 503300:Caster of Okeanos:Circe]
Not to mention it's an essential sweetener for the other dishes in my banquet.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠C：[servantName 503300:Caster of Okeanos:Circe]
In fact, you showed up at just the right time, Piglet.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠C：[servantName 503300:Caster of Okeanos:Circe]
Well, it's not like I've been waiting for you to show up or anything. More that I was just thinking how I might entertain you if you did. That's all.
[k]

＠C：[servantName 503300:Caster of Okeanos:Circe]
Now I can test those ideas and see if they work.[sr]That's all I care about. No, really.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠C：[servantName 503300:Caster of Okeanos:Circe]
Anyway, just sit tight and I'll make you some welcome kykeon right now. Know how they say anyone who shows up late needs to chug three drinks to catch up? I'm sure you understand where I'm going with that.

Well, then we'll have to take a walk to burn off some of those calories, won't we!?
[k]

＠C：[servantName 503300:Caster of Okeanos:Circe]
But as I'm sure you know, this island is riddled with rocky paths and uncertain footing. So, much as I'd rather not, I guess it falls to me to ensure my Master's safety and all.
[k]

＠C：[servantName 503300:Caster of Okeanos:Circe]
All right, you've convinced me. Just hold my hand while we walk together and everything will be fine.

[charaFace C 5]

If you want honey so badly, go talk to the young Medea. She always keeps it on hand for pancakes.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Medb
I don't want just any old honey.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]


＠Medb
I need honey so tantalizingly sweet the smell alone would make you quiver all over.
[k]


＠Medb
Something so alluring a man would kill his own family for it... That's the kind of honey I'm looking for.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]


＠Medb
But since there is no such honey, I thought the stuff used by the witch of Aeaea would be a decent substitute.
[k]

＠Medb
You should be honored to give me your honey.[sr]Now hand it over.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠C：[servantName 503300:Caster of Okeanos:Circe]
A substitute! I hardly see why I should be honored, but THAT is why you're interfering with my kykeon making!? What do you take me for!?
[k]


[charaFace A 4]
＠Medb
Actually...now that I think of it,[sr]I have an even more basic question for you.

Most people know it by its jingle, which says that it's delicious, nutritious, improves your complexion, and makes you lucky in love...
