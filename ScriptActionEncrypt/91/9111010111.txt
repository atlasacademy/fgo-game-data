Okay! Murderify this last irritating jerk and...victory![sr]This city...is clean!

Huh? What're you griping about, Master?[sr]Not good enough? Frustrated?
[k]

？1：Actually...what was that black thing...?
？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Oh. That's me.
[k]

？1：...Say what now?

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Oh crap...I mean, it's like a...uh...a metaphor.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Those were all nameless things.[sr]Failures, losers, wastes of flesh...a mob of the fallen.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
They're a bunch of idiots who[sr]only want to drag you down.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
They're not out to do right for the world. They don't want to change the world. All they have is a grudge that is burned into their very being...an instinct that compels them to kill humans.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Don't let it bother you. Think of this as a bonus game, like some freaky whack-a-mole thing.
[k]

？1：...
？2：What kind of hero was Aŋra Mainiiu?

？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Not a hero at all, actually! That's originally[sr]the name of the devil! Didn't you know?
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
But after a bunch of shenanigans, I ended up[sr]with a big fancy name and getup, and here I am!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
The only thing that's crystal[sr]clear is that I'm an Avenger.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
The opposite of a hero...an Anti-Hero who allows the hero to shine. A literal and figurative punching bag who was born from multitudinous blasphemies.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
That powerful resentment never fades...and spirits harboring those feelings even after their deaths are what makes an Avenger.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
But then again, I don't have any specific grudges, though there are plenty of folks who're really harboring grudges against me...
[k]


＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Oh, by the way, just to be clear, it's not about revenge, but avenging. I just want to make that clear so you get the distinction.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
So...that's what makes my position as a Servant a bit odd compared to anyone else.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
I'd probably not normally be able[sr]to be a part of your story.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
If this were a movie,[sr]I'd just be an extra in the background.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
I have neither a role nor a story, and even[sr]if I had, that story is long since over.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Even so, this whole mess was a result of my own carelessness.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
That black thing we just saw was an entity that failed to become a part of me. It looked like it didn't die off completely.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
So I did the admirable thing and offered to clean up this mess myself!
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Honestly, I know it's a part of me, but how powerful of a grudge could the thing have!? There's nobody left in this city to kill!
[k]

？1：You really don't seem like a Heroic Spirit who'd terrorize like that...
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Huh? What are you talking about? I AM terrifying. If I had the opportunity, I would kill you and have my way with you, maybe even in that order.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
No matter how much we get along, any Avenger would slip a knife between your ribs the moment you turn your back on them!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
...Well, okay, some of the others might go about it a little differently...like that newbie wearing the black coat. Well, I'm sure there's some variance.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Didn't anyone teach you what an[sr]Avenger is and how to recognize one?
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Those born from hatred speak of love... [51d4ff]/and they would show compassion after experiencing cruelty...[-]
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Those born from love speak of hatred. [51d4ff]/Those who experienced happiness meet their end through betrayal.[-]
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Avengers are usually one of those two. It's just the difference of whether they scorn love, or if they burn with pure hatred.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
But what both of them have in common is that they have an attachment to humans. Ever hear that the opposite of love is indifference?
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
The moment it clings to humans, it loses all[sr]chance at becoming something more than human.
[k]

？1：So you're saying that they're ultimately the same as people?
？2：So you're saying that it's meaningless hatred?

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Yeah, exactly! It's an endless cycle of[sr]“what goes around comes around!” You're pretty quick!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
So, let's go back. No sense hanging around[sr]this hellhole any longer than we have to.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Once we return to Chaldea, I'll get back to hiding like the worthless Servant I am, so don't bother summoning me, okay?
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
And you take care of reporting back to the Doctor.[sr]I can't stand the guy.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Oh and one more thing...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
This is just a little something to say thank[sr]you for being the oddball you are.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
And maybe we should leave this place as is. Maybe take care of it once the other seven Singularities are done.
[k]

Good work, [%1].[sr]Thanks to you, the strain on Sheba's been sorted out.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But you got back a lot faster than expected.[sr]Which Servant did you take along?
[k]

？1：Well...

＠Dr. Roman
...Avenger.[sr]Aŋra Mainiiu, huh?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I've never talked to him, but I've been interested in him. He's the evil god of Zoroastrianism, you see.
[k]

[charaFace B 10]

＠Dr. Roman
But based on your story, that Servant isn't really[sr]Aŋra Mainiiu itself. No, he sounds like someone who had the role foisted on him.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Dr. Roman
Regardless, he was obviously helpful in[sr]resolving this. I'll go and thank him later.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Dr. Roman
So those Shadow Servants were linked to[sr]Aŋra Mainiiu, huh? No wonder they were similar.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Dr. Roman
So, yeah...I was collecting data on my end, too.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
What I found was that the Shadow Servants you defeated had Spirit Origins very similar to Aŋra Mainiiu's.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm speculating here, but that Aŋra Mainiiu you had with you has a dormant skill that lets him keep going even after he's been killed.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Think of it like a sort of reset button.[sr]I'm certain it only works within Fuyuki, though.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He has a special ability that allows him to fight well beyond his own body's limitations. However, he's so out of control when using it that it ends up killing him.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But, should this “Annihilation Wish” be used not to destroy himself, but for some other purpose...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Well...he may be able to somehow escape that endless loop of dying again and again that he's trapped himself within.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And all this time, he'll be cursed by the endless[sr]mass of his own corpses that he's left behind.

[charaFace B 1]

＠Dr. Roman
However, it's...very unlikely he would ever encounter someone who could give him such an opportunity.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Because you know, he's really just[sr]kind of a worthless, cowardly jerk.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So to make a Heroic Spirit like him turn optimist?[sr]Well, that'd take a saint or something!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Dr. Roman
Or...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Maybe he encountered a plain old human...just an awkward sort of person who couldn't leave a Servant like him alone.
