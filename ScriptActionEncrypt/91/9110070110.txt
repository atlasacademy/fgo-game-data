＠Gawain
We've completed our daily training in the simulator.[sr]Good work, [%1].
[k]

＠Gawain
Tireless effort each day is the key to success.[sr]You seem to know that very well.
[k]

＠Gawain
As your retainer,[sr]I must also strive to[line 2]Hm?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Gawain
This is...what could this be? If I'm not mistaken,[sr]this looks like a tag for a writ of seizure.
[k]

？1：Huh? You're right.
？2：The latch for the item carrier is unlocked.

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Gawain
There appears to be a note.[sr]Let's see...
[k]

＠Gawain
“-Notice of Collections- Repayment for the[sr][f small]  [f -]borrowed Ascension materials is overdue.”
[k]

＠Gawain
“Therefore, under the terms of the loan as agreed upon,[sr][f small]  [f -]we have seized all items from your possession as[sr][f small]  [f -]repayment with the appropriate and agreed upon[sr][f small]  [f -]interest stipulated in the loan document.”
[k]

＠Gawain
“Yours in security, experience, and...love.[sr][f small]  [f -]Like a great neighbor, Caesar Co. is there.”

＠Gawain
I feel faint...[sr]I can only hope I'm not reading this right...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Gawain
[%1].[sr]Is what this flier says true?
[k]

？1：Now you mention it, he did give me a Proof of Hero.
？2：Honestly, it kinda got pushed on me...

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Gawain
Why didn't you refuse...[sr]Surely you know that nothing in life is free?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Gawain
Well, there's no use lamenting what is past.[sr]When did this happen, [%1]?
[k]

？1：About two months ago.
？2：Don't remember...it was so long ago.

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Gawain
This course of action is so obviously corrupt... Simply absconding with the goods without so much as a letter of intent or warning...
[k]

？1：The work of a true pro[line 2]Er, habitual criminal.
？2：But I didn't have much to take in the first place.

？！

＠Gawain
Not much to take?[sr]But there's a receipt here... (Gasp!)
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Gawain
It's! Not! Here! The materials I brought to[sr]commemorate your summoning me...are gone...!
[k]

？1：Y-you brought...what?

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Gawain
What a silly thing to ask... Tribute for my liege lord, of course. Since you are the one taking care of me, it seemed the only sensible and proper thing to do.
[k]

＠Gawain
Eh? Nobody does that? Everyone just comes empty-handed? ...Honestly, it seems no one has a real sense of what it is to be a hero anymore...
[k]

＠Gawain
At any rate, let me list off what I brought you:
[k]

＠Gawain
Four Octuplet Crystals, ten Hearts of the Foreign God, two Great Knight Medals, twenty Evil Bones, ten Forbidden Pages, and ten Seeds of Yggdrasil!
[k]

＠Gawain
The “Triple Sunny Recommended Set” has been taken![sr]This is a catastrophe!
[k]

？1：The Knights of the Round Table are awfully generous, huh?

[charaFace A 0]
＠Gawain
Of course. To be an asset, not a burden,[sr]to one's lord is the hallmark of a great knight.
[k]

？2：What a well-rounded set of materials.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Gawain
Of course. I thought materials like Evil Bones were unnecessary, but Gareth insisted that you would love them...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Gawain
Well, now's not the time to go over the contents of my gift!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Gawain
For a Servant to steal from his Master is a thing unheard of!
[k]

＠Gawain
In the name of the sun,[sr]I shall bring this evil Caesar to justice!
[k]
