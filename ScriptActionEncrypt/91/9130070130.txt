Just as I'm getting into it, it's over.[sr]Hardly worth the effort.

＠Cú Chulainn
How about you?[sr]Still ready for more?
[k]

？1：I'm a little tired.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
Haha![sr]You're honest!
[k]

？2：I can keep going.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
Sure you're not overdoing it?[sr]Well, not that I can help you.

＠Cú Chulainn
Well well, this is a good dream![sr]So saving the best one for last, huh?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
Besides, talk about being unfair. That one over there[sr]is using "the spear of the real me" from the start.

That's unfortunate.[sr]Why are you fighting with a hastily-made spear?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
I got my reasons.[sr]I guess it reminds me of my last summon.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn?
The answer's obvious, but I'll ask anyway.[sr]You want me to go easy on you?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
You've got to be kidding.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Cú Chulainn?
Ah, just as I'd hoped.[sr]Impressive, Cú Chulainn, hero of Ulster.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
What are you talking about?[sr]Well, Mr. "Cú Chulainn" of Ulster?
[k]

？1：Huh?

？2：Two Cú Chulainn?

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
Well, I guess it's possible. Meeting yourself[sr]in a dream. You get that, don't you?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Cú Chulainn?
Nice, that's really a good way to put it.[sr]Well, shall we do this[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Cú Chulainn
Sure![sr]Let's go, Master!
