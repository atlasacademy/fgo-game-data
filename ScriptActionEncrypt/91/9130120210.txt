A tune-up, he says! What a delightfully tactless way to ignore everything we just said about even Heroic Spirits needing rest. Truly, you are a detective without equal.

Brynhild's Spirit Origin is something of a special case even as these things go, since she was created by the Allfather of the Norse gods, Odin.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She may have managed to fit into the Servant container now, but she's still technically half Divine Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

Frankly, that she's materialized[sr]like this at all is a miracle.

＠Mash
That's true... They may not make up a large number of the Servants we see, but...
[k]

？2：Just off the top of my head...Stheno, Euryale, Quetz, Jaguar...

＠Mash
...Ishtar, Ereshkigal, and Gorgon[sr]are all Divine Spirits as well.

It's easy to lose sight of this now, but the fact that there are so many of them is still miraculous. I suppose it's also true that Chaldea's system for summoning Heroic Spirits is pretty special too.

...I would say so.[sr]They ARE Ghost Liners, after all!
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Holmes
That term refers to Heroic Spirits, a type of superior spiritual entity whose existence is comprised of records tied to humanity.
[k]

＠Holmes
Harnessing their awesome power is one of the most difficult spells imaginable, even compared to the Clock Tower's evocations[line 2]ah, summoning spells, in layman's terms.
[k]

[charaFace F 6]
＠Holmes
Not to mention that such power is a far cry from something like low-level Demonic Beast or ghost summons. Heroic Spirits are indeed rare and powerful.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Holmes
And from there, when you delve into how their ether bodies are given form and personality nearly identical to their living selves...

But we digress. Getting back to the topic at hand... The short of it is that Brynhild is special even by our rather odd standards.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_2 0.1]
＠Da Vinci
A good Master would be wise[sr]to pay some attention to her.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And while I'm at it, I think I WILL give her Spirit Origin a tune-up. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary at her last checkup, but you never know.
