＠Leonidas
Ah, what a fine battle!
[k]

＠Mash
All adjustments complete.[sr]The final enemy has been set.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
What do you want to do?

＠Mash
I think it's fair to conclude that training is over for today...
[k]

＠Leonidas
Not yet! We must follow this through to the end.[sr]On to the next enemy!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Understood.[sr]The final opponent is a random enemy.

＠Leonidas
...Um, Miss Mash.[sr]Just what is that, exactly?
[k]

＠Leonidas
Is it that, uh, you know.[sr]I think it starts with a "G."
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes, it's a Ghost-type enemy.
[k]

＠Leonidas
...Ghost...collective consciousness...science!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Leonidas?[sr]You seem to be sweating quite a lot...
[k]

＠Leonidas
What? No, not at all![sr]I'm doing fine here. Just fine.
[k]

＠Leonidas
You might not think so, but I once took on 100,000 men![sr]A mere spirit devoid of muscles is nothing to fear[line 2]

＠Leonidas
I apologize, Master! I confess[sr]I don't know how to deal with ghosts!
[k]

＠Leonidas
You see, my muscles are useless against them[line 2]![sr]They seem smarter than me!
[k]

？1：Let's overcome it.

＠Leonidas
Overcome it[sr]...you say?
[k]

＠Leonidas
U-Uh, I suppose it's not hard to say we won't run into ghost again in the future.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Thus, I must stand my ground![sr]Fear not, Leonidas!
[k]

＠Leonidas
This enemy's nothing compared to a Persian army of 100,000 men!
[k]

？2：Don't worry. Your attacks will work.

＠Leonidas
What![sr]...I see, you may be right.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Indeed, even these ghosts were once human![sr]Thus, my muscles are not useless after all!
[k]

？！

＠Leonidas
Very well, Master![sr]Let us face this ghost!
[k]

＠Leonidas
Raaaaargh![sr]We are ghost hunters!
