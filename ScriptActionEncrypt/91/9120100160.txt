Why you...stupid Servants! I can't believe my ambitions have been halted by mere familiars...

My golden opportunity lay right after humanity was restored. I took over this land's leyline...and I will take my revenge against the Mage's Association...!

Based on what he's saying, I assume he's a mage who was expelled from the Mage's Association for political reasons.

With this vast land and the leyline spread throughout it...my clan will return to its former glory.

But if you say it's not,[sr]I can't really argue that either.
