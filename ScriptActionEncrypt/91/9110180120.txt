Splendid job, Master. You managed to stay[sr]alive because of the summoning system.
[k]

？1：...This is a dream, right?

？2：I feel like I am using a lot of magical energy.

？！

＠Altera
This indeed is a dream, but our minds here are real.
[k]

＠Altera
Magical energy exists as a link between your mind and[sr]body, right? In that case, it's only natural you use it.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Altera
Have you used it all up yet? No, that's good to hear.[sr]You see, it's not over yet.

...This time, it doesn't even look like a human.
[k]

＠Altera
I wonder what that was. I feel like I have[sr]a dim memory of having killed a monster.
[k]

＠Altera
Or, maybe that is formed by some sort of concept?
[k]

＠Altera
Whatever that is[line 2]

＠Altera
...Hmm. For a mere concept, I see it's ready to kill.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Altera
...I'm so ashamed I could pass out.[sr]I can't believe I even envy such a thing.
[k]

＠Altera
Feelings, emotions.[sr]Things that I lacked, but now gained.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Altera
However, I can't control these feelings well.[sr]I've understood joy, but I don't how to express it.
[k]

？1：L-Let's just focus on the monster before us!

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
Of course, you know your priorities, Master.
[k]

？2：I think you're just awkward.

[charaFace C 4]
＠Altera
...That's a problem.[sr]Many of my allies would tell me that back then.
[k]

＠Altera
It makes me happy, but I'm sad.[sr]I really wish it was true.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 5]
＠Altera
At any rate, we need to defeat that thing first.[sr]Come on Master, try to pull it off again.
[k]

＠Altera
You'll actually die if you die here.[sr]If that happens, our contract will end.
[k]

＠Altera
I'll be free from this subordination, and you'll be free from life.
[k]

＠Altera
But that won't be fun.[sr]So, try not to die.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Altera
I'd like to talk to you just a little longer.
