＠Euryale
Don't worry about it.[sr]I just found something I expected to find.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Euryale
A message that "I" left for me.[sr]Or maybe a message that "I" left for her.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Euryale
It's nothing.[sr]Really.
[k]

＠Euryale
If by some chance, or miracle,[sr]she and I were to manifest in the same era...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Euryale
That's impossible of course, but if it was possible...[sr]And then we never saw each other...
[k]

＠Euryale
This was a short message from "me,"[sr]just in case that ever happened.
[k]

＠Euryale
She told "me" to never change.[sr]And for "you" to never change either.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]

...Wait, why are you making me say this?[sr]You're a cheeky human, [%1]!

Some resistance to her charm should be present, but her spell is truly irresistable.[sr]That's what makes that Goddess so amazing.

Of course.[sr]I'm a Goddess, beloved by all.

＠Euryale
All you have to do is love me.[sr]Just adore me from afar.
[k]

＠Euryale
Don't even think about peeking at me or inside of me.[sr]Otherwise[line 2]"a beautiful snake" will bite you!
