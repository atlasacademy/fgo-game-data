Um... I was searching for Sigurd...
[k]

＠Brynhild
Nursery brought this bear thinking he was Sigurd...
[k]

＠Brynhild
Even when I said he wasn't, she wouldn't listen. She said, “He may be a chocolate bear right now, but he'll turn into Sigurd when the curse is lifted.”
[k]

＠Brynhild
And so I was a little flustered.
[k]

？1：Is there a way to lift the chocolate curse?
？！

Yes... According to Nursery...

Hey Master, why do you think darling tries to escape?
[k]

＠Artemis
Weddings, golden anniversary celebrations... They don't really matter to me... Well, I might not go that far.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Artemis
But as long as my darling just stays with me... As long as he and I can live together forever, for eternity...
[k]

＠Artemis
That's all I really need.
[k]

Scared...that he'll hate me?

...That may be correct.
[k]

＠Brynhild
No matter how intimate a man and woman might be, if they are together for long enough, they may end up killing each other.
[k]

＠Brynhild
That is not because of pure hatred, but hatred that stems from love.
[k]

＠Brynhild
The more one loves, the stronger their wish not to detest or be detested becomes.

Human emotion is not something that is constant...[sr]But it shines all the brighter for it.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Nursery Rhyme
That bear flees from you because he wants you to always feel excited!
[k]

＠Nursery Rhyme
Because eternity is too boring!
[k]

＠Nursery Rhyme
When you're super bored, you might start hating the person you're with!

That's why you flee! The chase keeps you interested in the other person!

Fine. If that's what he wants, I'll chase after him for eternity!

＠Artemis
As long as my heart swells from the occasional, whimsical kindness from him, I will go absolutely crazy for my darling!

Yes, yes, my Maiden Circuits are in overdrive! Now, my darling! I shall lift your dreadful chocolate curse!
