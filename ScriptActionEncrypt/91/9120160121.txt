＠Emiya Alter
...[sr]...Guess he wasn't the one.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
But at least I found some new traces of magecraft.[sr]Come on, let's keep moving.

？1：R-right!

Why don't I ever talk to my other self?

＠Emiya Alter
Why would I? There's no point.

＠Emiya Alter
If he's all that's left of the man he used to be,[sr]I barely qualify as whatever's left over from that...
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
No, even that's giving me too much credit. If that were the case, I'd still have some reason to exist.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Emiya Alter
But I'm just a thing, without any purpose.[sr]It wouldn't make any difference if I was gone.

＠Emiya Alter
As far as the other guy's concerned, he could kill[sr]me a thousand times and it still wouldn't be enough.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
...These traces lead into that cave. Let's hurry.

[charaFace A 4]

...[sr]...
[k]

？2：I do, but what other choice do we have?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Emiya Alter
Gotcha.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
At least you're not as dense as I thought.
[k]

？！

＠Emiya Alter
I'm guessing this is a dreamworld.[sr]An artificial hell. The end of nothingness.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
A place that makes you confront your sins and demands you pay for them.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
...I've seen it before.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Emiya Alter
But I don't know why we're here.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I'm not looking for anything from you,[sr]and you're not looking for anything from me.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Emiya Alter
We're just helping each other out. That's all there is to it.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
So then, why am I[line 2]why are we here?
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Anyway, let's keep moving. Whatever's going on here,[sr]we'll have to take care of it before we can go home.

I might not remember them myself,[sr]but I do have records of my past deeds.
[k]

＠
I know exactly how many people I killed,[sr]and how many mages.
[k]

＠
I don't feel any guilt over their deaths,[sr]and I've never been punished for them either.

＠
Every bullet I fire hits its mark,[sr]making the world safer.

When did my path split from his?

＠
I'm not jealous. I don't envy him.[sr]I just find myself wondering from time to time.
[k]

＠
It feels like a monster with its jaws open wide is slowly making its way toward me.
[k]

＠
I'd probably feel a lot better[sr]if I just let it swallow me up.
[k]

＠
But I'm not that far gone.
[k]

＠
...Not yet, anyway.
