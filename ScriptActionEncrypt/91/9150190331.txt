[line 3]Actually, there's no such thing as the True Body of[sr]Gorgon. Even if there was it wouldn't be introduced here.

Haha... You scared me for a moment.[sr]Turns out it was just you three attacking together.

You're really out of ammunition now, right?[sr]Just give up already and release me from this curse!

A curse... What is that?[sr]Surely, my sisters didn't cause you any trouble...

Don't worry about it, I know you're always the victim.[sr]Sorry about the rough treatment. Why don't you rest?

You two, Stheno and Euryale![sr]Get rid of this rejuvenation curse on me!

Hehe. So "I" didn't realize after all.[sr]That's Lord El-Melloi II himself.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Stheno
For some reason, he's returned to his younger self.

No way! That handsome man used to look like that?[sr]How much pain do you have to endure to grow into that?

That's my business. Leave me alone![sr]Wait, hold on. You didn't know?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Euryale
Nope, I didn't know.[sr]If I did, I would've teased you much more.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]

So, so, so, so what's the cause, then?[sr]I can't think of any other external factors!

[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Well, then the answer is clear, isn't it? If there are no[sr]external factors, it just means your growth led to that body.

Fou.

It is a logical conclusion.[sr]Your body got younger because of your Ascension.

That's... That's ridiculous...[sr]Then it's pointless, isn't it?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠El-Melloi(Young)
Ascension is a reform to make one stronger![sr]Why would I revert to a form when I was immature?

＠Stheno
For you, there are things you can only do in that form...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Stheno
Rather, you can say that form is the "origin of all your concepts."
[k]

＠Stheno
See, your ability as a Servant hasn't degraded one bit, right?
[k]

＠Stheno
When you fight as a "main character," that form is the most powerful... Or most fitting.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Stheno
You didn't even realize it...[sr]How adorable can you get?
[k]

＠Stheno
I ended up playing with you for a bit.[sr]I received the best present to relieve my boredom♡
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠El-Melloi(Young)
Ugh...Ughhh...Ughhhhhhhhh...[sr]Again...Again, played by you!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Stheno
But, it doesn't feel right to just keep taking from you...
[k]

＠Stheno
If you play some more, I may be able to give you information about an elixir to turn you back, Lord El-Melloi.

...Those who challenge Stheno will only end up being[sr]played by her and then disposed of...I shall be careful.

？1：Let's go back to Chaldea.
