＠Emiya
For our next topic, I'll explain what makes each class unique. We'll start with the Archer class,
[k]

＠Emiya
Archers, as the name implies, use a bow as their primary weapon.
[k]

＠Emiya
While inferior to Saber and Lancer in close range combat, they excel at providing long range support.
[k]

＠Emiya
They also have a skill called "Independent Action."
[k]

＠Emiya
Even without a link to their Master, they can function for a while on their own.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
But they won't be able to maintain the physical body.
[k]

＠Mash
Lack of energy source aside, wouldn't they be forced back to the Throne without an anchor to this world?
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Emiya
Normally, yeah. But with Independent Action,[sr]they can ease up the "force exerted by the World."
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Emiya
After all, there are many stories of snipers camping out 3 days and 3 nights just to hit their targets.
[k]

＠Emiya
Think of it as a skill that allows them to function for a few days apart from their Master.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Emiya
What's important is that the skill differs from Assassin's[sr]Presence Concealment. It does not conceal your movement.
[k]

＠Emiya
Stealth operations thus require the appropriate skill, or backups from their Master.

Archer, I hate to interrupt [%1]'s lecture, but as I'm sure you're aware...

An enemy attack, right? They always pick the[sr]worst timing. It's so hard to have class outdoors.

(...I probably shouldn't mention that Archer's loud voice is telling the enemy exactly where we are, right?)
