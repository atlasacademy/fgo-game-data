＠Achilles
Impressive. I'm not a big fan of kings,[sr]but you, I think I like.
[k]

＠Achilles
And that horse, too[line 3][sr]It's splendid. Truly excellent.

＠Achilles
Actually, I think there are no bad Riders.[sr]That's my theory, anyway.

＠Alexander
Hah, hah... I agree, but I didn't think...[sr]You'd have this much talent as a general!
[k]

＠Alexander
The pirates' tactics were as messed up as Elisabeth's singing, and you brought them together...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Alexander
Fighting with soldiers, not just one on one...is so much fun!

＠Alexander
Someday I'll learn this feeling for myself, although really I should already know it. But I think...
[k]

＠Alexander
I want to... I want to fight you more. I want to share this excitement, and the honor of the battlefield...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Alexander
With more...people...someday...

...Wow, we just saw something amazing...[sr]I can't believe we're still alive...
[k]

＠Pirate
The world's big... It's too big...
[k]

＠Pirate
There's flying horses that summon lightning and stuff...[sr]I think I'm reevaluating my life!
[k]

＠Pirate
Yup, I can't do this![sr]Being a pirate on seas like this is suicide!
[k]

＠Pirate
We're better off landlocked![sr]Teacher, we're getting out of the pirate business!
[k]

＠Pirate
We'll pay the lesson fees later! Bye!

...Combat has concluded. No wounded on our side, and no casualties among theirs.
[k]

？1：That was a fun fight, huh?
？2：This is a different kind of fight altogether.

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
...Yes. Alexander's charge on horseback and the way Achilles rallied the pirates were both amazing.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
The pirates that seemed so dangerous at first...[sr]They were completely taken aback by it.

＠Achilles
Good work. You're that kid's guardian, right?[sr]I bet he gets you in all kinds of trouble.
[k]

＠Achilles
One day, I'm sure he'll be a great king somewhere.[sr]Until then, just keep an eye on him.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Achilles
Right now he's just a little brat.[sr]Man, look at his sleeping face.

＠Mash
No matter how cheerful he may seem, his actions and beliefs are filled with power. I can feel it.

...Even if that path is filled with turmoil and chaos.

[charaFace A 1]

The men he commands will probably lead happy lives.

？2：It'll be hard for those around him.
