Why am I putting myself through so much strenuous exercise? Why couldn't I be satisfied with Pharaoh Nitocris's workout, or the desert's?
[k]

＠Cleopatra
I'm sure those questions have crossed your[sr]mind at least once or twice, my secretary.

[charaFace A 5]


＠Cleopatra
Why am I working so hard to improve[sr]a body that is already perfect?
[k]

＠Cleopatra
I don't blame you for wondering. You must find it more intriguing than any of the Seven Wonders of the World. I doubt even that famous detective could understand.
