＠Atalante
...Hey, Master, do you have any wishes for the Grail?
[k]

？1：Not really.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Atalante
Hmm.[sr]I see...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Atalante
Well, given the state of the world that makes sense, I guess.
[k]

＠Atalante
But the Grail's power is omnipotent.[sr]Perhaps you should come up with a wish.
[k]

？2：To restore the world.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Atalante
...Hmph. That's exactly the right wish.[sr]But it's also the wrong answer.
[k]

＠Atalante
When you get the Grail, that wish should come true on its own.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Atalante
A greedy answer isn't necessarily the wrong one.[sr]Keep that in mind.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Atalante
...To tell the truth, I have a wish of my own.[sr]It's a simple wish, and I know it will never come[sr]true[line 2]
[k]

＠Atalante
But I still can't give up on it.[sr]That's why I pray to the gods.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Atalante
I protect my vows to the gods.[sr]...Or so I thought...
