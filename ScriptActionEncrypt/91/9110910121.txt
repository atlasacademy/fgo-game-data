I'm sorry for all the trouble[sr]our breast fiend caused you.

It's even hard for us to tell when he's joking, so it must have been bewildering for you. Again, I'm sorry.

Is this a dream I'm having? The one where [&Prince:Princess][sr]Charming comes to save me when I'm in distress...?

I don't see how that could be...[sr]But, if you're here right now, then... (Gasp!)[wt 0.4][charaFace A 2]

I don't know what's going on, but I must be dreaming! And that means I should be able to have things here turn out just the way I want!

Besides, [%1] wouldn't even[sr]be here right now if it wasn't for you.

As if it wasn't bad enough you[sr]slipped and fell on top of [&him:her]...

...you just had to go and send [&him:her] tumbling into your oversized Breast Valley.

＠BB
So watch it, okay? If I hadn't been here, you'd have made a real mess of things...[%1] included.
