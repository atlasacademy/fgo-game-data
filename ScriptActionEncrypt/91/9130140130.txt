Why, you ask? To sharpen my spear. Spears are meant for killing, and so only killing can hone their edges.

Purgatorio, you have been going on and on about making your spear sharper, which leaves me a bit confused.

Which is it? Do you wish for your spear to grow sharper, or do you wish to grow stronger?
