He barks affirmatively.
[k]

＠
He will find this Demonic Beast hiding[sr]somewhere in Shinjuku, and finish it.
[k]

＠
He will follow its scent and ensure[sr]it has nowhere left to run.
[k]

＠
That is his mission.
[k]

＠
Although...doing this for his Master[sr]almost makes him feel like...a dog.

The beast breaks into a run, as if to keep the clay creature running off in front of him under control.
[k]

＠
And then, the beast sees the being tying him down[sr]to this world, almost daring him to escape.

His Master, [%1].[sr]The one they call “human.”
