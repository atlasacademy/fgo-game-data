Well, that's because living makes me long for death... A satisfactory death from the ultimate thrust.

I know it's too much too ask for and an annoyance. But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Scáthach
I have a body which seeks but is denied death, a mere ghost who's burned onto the world.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
However, with this world incinerated, the Land of Shadows is no more. That's why I can be summoned as a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Scáthach
To fight as a warrior, to lose my life if defeated[line 3][sr]A chance to live like a proper person.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

Then it's only natural wanting to try it, no?[sr]Assuming there's a warrior greater than me.

[k]

＠Scáthach
Since I couldn't leave the Land of Shadows, my only way to make sure was through my messengers.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
Yes, a bit. Stand back, [%1].[sr]A spear tip is more suitable for her than words.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
...Dammit. Sending clueless kids as messengers.[sr]What kind of bad joke is that?

[charaFace E 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
You are immortal physically, but your soul is dead. You're wise, but what you are is no different than a hellish fiend.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Now that very soul has materialized in this world, then I guess it's the pupil's job to finish his mentor off.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Yes. Now then, Child of Light.[sr]Try to kill me for good this time.
