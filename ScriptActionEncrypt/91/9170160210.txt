＠Tamamo Cat
Be patient, I have a long story to tell. That Tamamo-no-Mae is one horrible Servant.
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
Now she's turned over a new leaf... I think? But[sr]when she was fully matured she was really terrible.
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
When a demon fox gains a tail, its power will grow[sr]exponentially. When it becomes a nine-tailed demon fox, its power is immeasurable.

[charaFace D 2]
＠Tamamo Cat
When that happened to her, she became afraid of[sr]herself. Thinking that she would never get married like that, she ripped off her tails.

＠Tamamo Cat
One of those tails became me, Tamamo Cat.

It appears that they were attracted by the smell of the[sr]food! Since they're here for that, they're pretty tough! For some reason[line 3]

...Uh-oh. This is bad.[sr]Since I'm the same way, I can tell.

？1：What is it, Cat?

？2：...You mean, we can't win?

？！

＠Tamamo Cat
It's bad.[sr]The way I am now, I can't defeat these brutes.

[charaFace D 5]
＠Tamamo Cat
It's...like I was just telling you, Master.[sr]When we get serious, we turn pretty nasty.

I've put a seal on my Noble Phantasm until now.[sr]Master, will it help if I'm strong?

＠Tamamo Cat
Will you still love me if I'm strong?
