I can't believe we had to fight a powerful Phantasmal in a wasteland like this for no particular reason.

Mash, [%1], well done...[sr]I can imagine how tired you must be...

What are you so depressed for?[sr]Now is the time to raise a victory shout.
[k]

＠Altria
By your own hand, you have proven that you are without limits.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Altria
As the Servant who serves you, nothing could make me more proud.
[k]

？1：Y-You really mean it?

？2：You're proud, Saber?

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Altria
Yes. We Servants are not...[sr]interested in our own strength.

Ahem. Mash, please keep that to yourself.

＠Altria
In a sense, Heroic Spirits are beings who can see their[sr]end, their[line 3]final form. We each know our own strength.
[k]

＠Altria
That is not true of you. Where will the humans[sr]living in your era find themselves in the end?
[k]

＠Altria
How much will they grow? What heights will they reach?[sr]To us Heroic Spirits, it is beyond our imagination.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Altria
That is why I am proud that I met a Master such as you.
[k]

＠Altria
...It is odd, though.[sr]I feel as if something like this has happened before.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Altria
Perhaps I will meet "someone" like you at some point.
[k]

＠Altria
...I can be inspired by a Master I respect and love, even if they are inexperienced.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Altria
However, this is not the time for that.[sr]What I can do is to guide you to your final battle.
[k]

＠Altria
[%1], Master of Chaldea.[sr]My sword has acknowledged your worth.
[k]

＠Altria
I too, shall strive to serve you with more strength.[sr]Let us continue to fight well together.

We got King Arthur's stamp of approval...[sr]Plus, we got an upgrade on her Noble Phantasm...
[k]

？1：Let's keep fighting the good fight, Saber.

Yes, please use the increased strength of my Noble Phantasm as your secret weapon against powerful enemies.

Y-You think so?[sr]I thought that the ends justified the means.

Judging from Mash's exhaustion, I see that perhaps I did go too far. Very well, I shall be more careful from now on!
