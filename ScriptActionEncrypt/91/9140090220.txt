That is to say, I don't mean the Holy Grails we recover.[sr]I mean the true Holy Grail of legend.

That would be an adventure indeed.[sr]Master, do you want the Holy Grail?
[k]

？1：I want a future.

？2：I want peace.

＠Mary
I see. You aren't very greedy.[sr]Or maybe you are.
[k]

＠Mary
The future or peace... Those are really big wishes, so you probably don't have time to be thinking about smaller wishes.
