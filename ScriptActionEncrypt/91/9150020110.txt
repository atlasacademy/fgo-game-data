Oh, what a wasteland! Scorched earth with no sign[sr]of human life, nor blade of grass left behind!

＠Gilles
What manner of disaster could have befallen it?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
We're not sure of the details, either. At any rate,[sr]a strange natural disaster beyond human knowledge...
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Gilles
Natural disaster! Not the ravages of war? Some caprice of God unrelated to Man's sins wiped out those living here?

Hm...I had some concern regarding the man[sr]who was the basis for the legend of Bluebeard, but...

Human life is like a fruit. Squeeze, and the gem-like nectar shall sates my thirst. However!

[charaFace D 5]

Pain and screams! Fear and despair! Crushed before[sr]they could be fully squeezed out is such a waste!

[charaFace A 6]

...Pardon?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Gilles
Outrageous! A natural disaster as a caprice of God, and the waste of new lives is outrageous!

The agonies of all creatures should only be unleashed[sr]by one who appreciates the joy of plucking out a life!

Well, even so. His abilities as a Servant[sr]can't be measured by the scale of good and evil.
[k]

His personality may be kind of out there, but consider him an invaluable assets to be used effectively.

No surprising. Precious few have a genius for aesthetics.[sr]It's not something you develop in a short time.

In place of God and Satan, let us both[sr]savor the light of life, treasured as the stars!

I heard that Gilles de Rais was a great hero[sr]who supported Jeanne d'Arc as a war marshal.

＠Dr. Roman
Yes, but at the same time, he's known as a pleasure killer who murdered hundreds of young children.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
While he's a popular Heroic Spirit, that dual nature means he can be a completely different person depending on the class he's summoned in.

[communicationCharaFace 0]

How well you master a Servant like this[sr]depends on the Master's latent potential.
