＠Romulus
Don't you understand, King of the Sacred Lance?[sr]You are not drawing out the sacred lance's full potential.
[k]

＠Romulus
Or should I say you were not intoxicated by it.[sr]You fought to protect your Master.
[k]

＠Romulus
However, it was not a fight to protect the world. Naturally, your lance would lose its radiance.
[k]


[charaTalk A]


＠Altria
What...! My lance remains! It is as radiant as ever!

＠Romulus
...You leave me no choice.[sr]I did not want to resort to action that's Un-Roman.
[k]

＠Romulus
However, sometimes violence is necessary.[sr]And that is now, [%1].
[k]

？1：...He's coming!
？2：A frontal assault to finish us off...?

？！

＠Romulus
I ask of you, [%1].[sr][charaFace F 5][effect bit_talk_41]Say you love Altria Pendragon!

Precisely. So your own words betray you, King of Knights!

You not only rejoice in your Master's love, you also hold your Master in esteem.

That is fine. That is how it should be.
[k]

＠Romulus
Knight of the Sacred Lance. You are the child of a dragon, yet you are human, and strive to be human.
[k]

＠Romulus
Your soul still burns with passion. You possess a god's vantage point, but fall short of a god's heart.
[k]

＠Romulus
You failed to become a mechanical god.[sr]And that, precisely, is[line 3]
[k]

？1：Rome, right?

？！

＠Romulus
...Indeed. Ro[charaFace F 4]me is adventure[line 3]
[k]

＠Romulus
The symbol for all that is human, graduating from the Age of Gods and gaining the heart to love fellow men as a human.

？2：You're still the King Arthur of legend.

？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠Altria
You think so? It's hard...for me to accept, but...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Altria
...But, if you, my Master, say so, perhaps it is true.
[k]

＠Altria
Hah hah. Being told something like that in such a loud voice would surprise anyone, of course.
[k]

＠Altria
Allow me to apologize. I said that you could not understand me.
[k]

＠Altria
I will not retract that comment. It is an unshakeable fact that we are different.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Altria
But... I may have been stubborn. There are times we may understand each other despite differing positions.
[k]

＠Altria
With that, will you fear me, or rely on me?[sr]I shall see firsthand.
[k]

？1：Yeah. I'm counting on you, Altria.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Altria
Yes. I look forward to our future time together, Master.
[k]

？2：I admit I'm a little scared.

[charaFace A 3]

＠Altria
Y-Yes, that is true. I do not know...and it is not my fault, but...
[k]

＠Altria
I heard the Lion King stormed through the Holy City, so I will try not to turn out like that...

Bwa[charaFace A 0]hahahaha! King of Knights, you've finally warmed up a bit!

I've been waiting. I've been waiting so long for this moment!

This is the perfect chance![sr]A Chance-sseum Tentyris!
[k]

＠???
Prepare yourself! You're not exactly my type, but I've always wanted to make you bow before me!
[k]

？1：This voice...!

[charaTalk A]

＠Altria
...I see. Not being able to take a hint was something this excruciating...
[k]

＠Altria
I shall be careful myself, and not barge in when no one wants to see me.
[k]

？2：Doesn't this dream have too many guests!?

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 4]

Yes, I agree. I shall make sure Merlin gets his just punishment someday.
