Just as I will never again be[sr]seen merely as a priestess...
[k]

＠Circe
...Medea, you too have become[sr]a woman to be feared as a witch.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Circe
So of course you're gonna mess other people's lives up something fierce. You can't help it! You're a witch!
[k]

＠Circe
Go ahead and seduce any man you want,[sr]then toss him aside when you're done!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Circe
That's one of the best parts of being a witch, you know. You should be proud that you're worth that.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Circe
Although, I gotta say...you don't[sr]look all that happy about this to me.
[k]

＠Circe
I can see you're smiling while we stand here, but I can also tell you're crying on the inside, and I have to say I don't like that.

＠Circe
(Sigh)... How many times did I tell you[sr]to learn the medicinal arts too, Medea?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Circe
Hecate's medicinal arts don't just heal the body.[sr]They have a powerful effect on the heart, too.
[k]

＠Circe
But only if you spent time devoting yourself to the study of how the heart works while learning them.
[k]

＠Circe
If you do that, it's a wonderful way to tame the monsters lurking in your heart.
[k]

＠Circe
For a disciple of Hecate, I gotta say...I'm disappointed in myself for releasing such a half-assed witch into the world.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Circe
...This is exactly why I didn't want to[sr]take on an apprentice in the first place.
[k]


[charaFace A 2]
＠Circe
But, now that we're here, I guess this scuffle's as good a time as any to teach you one last lesson!
