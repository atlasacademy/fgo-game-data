＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
The key difference between you and me, Columbus, is that I was made to be evil, where you were labeled evil by others.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
But in both our cases, the question is:[sr]Who decided we were evil?
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
For you, I imagine that's the[sr]means of measuring you spoke of.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
I was hoping to determine whether you still follow your original time period's sense of morality...
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
...or whether you've come to adopt more modern ones...

All right, this'll be your payment then. Though I've gotta say, it's a little embarrassing talking about myself like this.
[k]

＠Columbus
If you want to know what I think I am,[sr]well...I'm afraid all I can say is this:

[charaFace B 1]


＠Columbus
I'm myself. I'm the man most people[sr]know as Christopher Columbus.
[k]

＠Columbus
Back when I was younger, I went by Cristoforo Colombo, and in España, I'm known as Cristóbal Colón...
[k]

？1：No fair!
？2：That's not what I meant, and you know it!
？！

[charaFace B 1]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]


＠Columbus
Haha, well, I had to try. But if you're[sr]not satisfied with that, I'll keep going.
[k]

＠Columbus
Given my current position, it might be easier to think about why I was summoned as a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Columbus
Was it because I'm a sailor?[sr]A merchant? A villain? Of course not.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Columbus
Hell, I just turned down invites for all those clubs 'cause I didn't want to be pigeonholed into any of those particular categories.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Columbus
So then, why was I summoned as a Servant?
[k]

[wt 0.8]
[charaFace B 1]


＠Columbus
I think it's because I made my dream come true.
[k]

＠Columbus
I think it's because I proved to the whole world that, as long as you never give up, you can make your dream a reality, no matter what that dream may be.
[k]


[charaFadeout B 0.1]
[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 12]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Mash
Still...if we're talking about your Servant status, well, you are technically a Rider, right?
[k]

＠Mash
So while you may not be a pirate, I still can't help but think the sailor part must be pretty relevant, since it involves riding a ship...

No matter what sort of hardships I encountered, or how many other people I stepped on, or how long it took...
[k]

＠Columbus
...I believed I'd eventually arrive at my goal as long as I kept moving forward, and never stopped believing till the very end.
[k]

＠Columbus
You know, thinking about it now...
[k]

＠Columbus
...I might just be the best example there is of a Servant that made their dreams come true.
[k]





[charaFadeout B 0.1]

＠Columbus
Oh, and while we're on the subject, let me make one more thing clear about the role I have to play.
[k]

＠Columbus
Like I just said, the only thing I've got going for me is my ability to follow my dreams.
[k]

＠Columbus
But you know, my dream from when I was still alive already came true. I don't need to discover the New World all over again.
[k]

＠Columbus
So then, what dream should I pursue now that I'm a Servant? What do I set my sights on and chase after with all I've got?
[k]

＠Columbus
Well, I think the answer to that question[line 2]the thing that gives dream-chasing Servants something worth chasing[line 2]is probably you, Master.
[k]

？1：...!
？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠Columbus
'Course, I still have a mind and a will of my own.
[k]

＠Columbus
I'll still go after any easy money there is to be made, go wherever I want, and do whatever I want.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Columbus
But all that said...
[k]

＠Columbus
If you point me towards something that can match discovering the New World...
[k]

＠Columbus
...and if I can think of it as my own dream...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Columbus
...then I'll do whatever it takes to get there.[sr]Guaranteed.
[k]

＠Columbus
So as long as you're on board my ship,[sr]I'll make sure you get there too.
[k]

＠Columbus
I don't care if it involves restoring humanity, achieving world peace, or even conquering the world.
[k]

＠Columbus
The only thing I've got going for me is my tenacity.[sr]As for what I use it for, well...that's up to you.
[k]

＠Columbus
It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks about the end result. Good, bad, it's all the same to me.
[k]

＠Columbus
All I care about...is following my dream until it becomes reality.
[k]

？1：...I'll remember that.
？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠Columbus
Good. Anyway, thanks again for helping me out today. Give me a shout the next time you head to the treasury.
[k]

＠Mash
You know...I think I understand Columbus just a little bit better now.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
Even though he changed the world, he only did so because he was chasing his own dream.
[k]

＠Mash
That must be why he doesn't like having his actions, or his ethics, or the good and bad sides of his deeds, labeled one way or the other.
[k]

＠Mash
Because that would just be him[sr]going by someone else's metric.
[k]

＠Mash
The only things he's concerned with are his own dreams and desires, as determined by his own way of thinking.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
So...if we can come up with a good dream for him...one that lines up with our own goals...
[k]

＠Mash
...then I think he might just end up[sr]being a tremendously capable ally.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Mash
On the other hand...if we show him the wrong sort of dream by mistake, he'll probably end up doing things that most would describe as evil.
[k]

？1：True. We'd better be careful...
？！

[charaFace B 11]

＠Columbus
...and I've decided to join your club after all.[sr]Here's my registration form.
[k]

＠Columbus
I figured, if I'm gonna join any club around here,[sr]this one looks like the best fit.
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Columbus
Course, I already went and declined while Master was present, plus the other clubs I turned down.

[k]

[charaFace D 5]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
...You're doing the same thing with the Pirate Club and Merchants Association as well, aren't you?
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
I trust you fed them the same line, and similarly asked them to keep your membership secret?

＠Columbus
If only I'd had a smart guy like you on my crew instead of Pinzón or Bartolome!
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Columbus
Still, I didn't technically lie[sr]to Master and Mash, you know?
[k]

＠Columbus
I am me. It's not accurate to say I'm just a pirate, or just a merchant, or just a villain.
[k]

＠Columbus
But...if you're gonna say I'm all of them, well,[sr]that's fine with me. Accurate, that's for sure!
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Columbus
So...if you're that smart, Professor, do you also know why I went to all the trouble of getting Master involved and making a show of turning you all down?
[k]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
Of course. The answer couldn't be simpler: to gain all you could, personally, from your membership to each club as was possible.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
After all, you only act to satisfy[sr]your own personal desires.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
You brought Master along to spread the belief throughout Chaldea that you would not be joining any of the Servants' clubs.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
Then, when you went to a club and said you would make an exception just for them, you would be assured a special position. A shadow member, if you will.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
In doing so, you will be able to gain insider knowledge while staying out of the spotlight.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
Naturally, there are many merits to such an approach. For one, you can act with greater impunity, knowing you will be safe even if the club should go south.

[charaFace D 5]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
The pleasure's all mine. After all, you achieved tremendous success and changed the world itself merely by following your own selfish dreams and desires.

As far as I'm concerned, that is a world-class criminal accomplishment. I daresay I'm rather envious...
