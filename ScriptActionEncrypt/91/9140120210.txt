All right...[bgm BGM_EVENT_4 0.1][sr]I'm ready. I'll take you to him now.

＠Arash
This second hero is a traveler[line 2]at least he is now.[sr]He likes to wander around even more than me.
[k]

＠Arash
But no matter how accustomed to traveling he might be,[sr]I doubt he'll have Rayshifted without you, Master.
[k]

＠Arash
(He might still be wandering[sr]aimlessly outside Chaldea, though!)
[k]

＠Arash
Anyway, he's usually hanging[sr]out somewhere in the simulator.

Since I am always at my Pharaoh's side,[sr]I have become completely accustomed to the feel of it!

I have no problem fighting battles there, either.[sr]Rest assured, you will have nothing to worry about!

Shinjuku... Tokyo...
[k]

＠Nitocris
That's a major city of the Far East, as I recall.[sr]But the magical energy pervading this place is...

？2：It's a Japanese city as it was about twenty years ago.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Nitocris
I see. But then, why is there so much[sr]magical energy pervading this place?

It feels very...strange...

You know how places like that are supposed to[sr]have gone a different way from normal history?

This one's a good example. It LOOKS like the[sr]same city I remember from 1999, but it's not.
