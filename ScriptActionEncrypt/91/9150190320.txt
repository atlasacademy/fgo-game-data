＠Euryale
But you're mistaken if you think we'll allow some nameless brats like you to talk down to us like that.

I'll show you the technique that has made[sr]brave men cry. Is that ok, "me?"

That cheeky guy over there![sr]He dared to raise his hand against us!

[charaFace E 4]

That's right. Despite our hospitality to welcome him[sr]as a guest, he charged at us without saying a word!
