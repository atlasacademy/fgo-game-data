It is I, Vishnu.[sr]Rama, awaken...

＠Rama
Oh, crap, Vishnu!?
[k]

＠Vishnu
“Crap”?
[k]

＠Rama
M-my sincerest apologies...!
[k]

＠Vishnu
Rama. How has everything been going[sr]since [%1] summoned you?
[k]

＠Vishnu
Is there anything you feel is missing,[sr]or do you have any immediate concerns?
[k]

＠Rama
No, Master is always kind to me.
[k]

＠Rama
Master treats me not as a king,[sr]not as [&his:her] retainer, but as a friend.
[k]

＠Rama
I have not had any complaints since I have been summoned.
[k]

＠Vishnu
...I see. That was a quick response.[sr]How about during battle?
[k]

＠Rama
Hahaha. I'm all good on the fighting front![sr]I would love to show you my power, Vishnu!
[k]

＠Vishnu
Oh, really? Is that so? That's some big talk.[sr]I never took you for the type to talk that way.
[k]

＠Rama
Eh?[sr]V-Vishnu...?
[k]

＠Vishnu
Rama...[sr]Oh, Rama...
[k]

＠Vishnu
Think back, Rama. Back to when you manifested as a Servant, to when you were given your Noble Phantasm...
[k]

＠Rama
Eh? Are you talking about another, different[sr]Noble Phantasm than my Brahmastra...?
[k]

＠Rama
Vishnu Baazoo, the Arm of the Great One...oh!
[k]

＠Vishnu
Rama...[sr]Oh, Rama...
[k]

＠Vishnu
You! Have! Forgotten! The Noble Phantasm![sr]With! My! Name! You! Forgot! You can't use it!!!
[k]

＠Rama
Gyaaa[messageShake 0.01 5 5 0.7]aaahhh!!![sr]I-I-I-I'm terribly sorry, great Vishnu!
[k]

＠Vishnu
Well, that won't do, will it?[sr]What's the deal, Rama?
[k]

＠Vishnu
Did you really not realize until I just reminded you that your Noble Phantasm was sealed!? What have you got between your ears!? Marshmallows!?
[k]

＠Rama
A-absolutely not! I d-didn't forget It's just... W-well, um, I've never encountered any enemies strong enough to require using your power...
[k]

＠Vishnu
Oh-ho. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, knowing your power. But then, I suppose you must not have any use for this Noble Phantasm, either.
[k]

＠Vishnu
Even without your Brahmastra, you'll be fine.
[k]

＠Rama
But...![sr]P-please do not go, great Vishnu!
[k]

＠Rama
I...I was mistaken![sr]Please, at least leave me my Brahmastra!
[k]

＠Vishnu
...Very well. If you're that desperate,[sr]I shall give you a chance.
[k]

＠Vishnu
However, understand that to succeed, you must repeatedly shout my favorite word.
[k]

＠Rama
Y-yes! Certainly and swiftly!
[k]

＠Vishnu
Very well. That is the lifestyle that you must always be mindful of. They say that swiftness and decisiveness are most important to a soldier.
[k]

＠Vishnu
Now, then. I have somewhere for you to travel with your Master. There, you will find the trial I have set for you.
[k]

＠Vishnu
Know this: should you fail in this trial...you will no longer receive my blessing.
[k]

＠Rama
You can count on me!
[k]

＠Vishnu
You must always mind me, and never again forget me... Use your Noble Phantasm properly (...erly...erly...)

Hm. Well, actually... The being I spoke to was both the great Vishnu, and not Vishnu at the same time.
[k]

＠Rama
It's the Vishnu that I envision, since I've never really MET them personally!
[k]

＠Rama
Besides, the great Vishnu who appears in my dreams doesn't seem to have a fully formed personality and is maybe a bit wacky.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Rama
But this much I'm certain of: I receive a message from the great Vishnu whenever I lose my way or forget something.
[k]

＠Rama
It could be my subconscious trying to make me realize that I had unknowingly blinded myself to something...
[k]

＠Rama
Or perhaps the real great Vishnu is truly sending me a message... I'm honestly not sure.

Most conspiracies have their genesis in tiny doubts.[sr]I count myself lucky that I wasn't killed, at least.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Rama
Luckily, my younger brother Lakshmana also came with me. It felt like I was heading out on a long journey rather than getting exiled.

And above all, since I had Sita with me, my exile wasn't so bad.

Everything went downhill after Sita was taken.[sr]Hey, Master...

＠Rama
You fight all your battles to restore humanity. I have no hesitation offering my life for that purpose.

However, had I been summoned for a proper Holy Grail War, I may have wished for the following:

To change the past.[sr]To undo the past where Sita was taken from me.

It's true that a normal Holy Grail War might be able to grant that wish.

＠Dr. Roman
But it could create various distortions. For example, Sita may not have been taken, but the curse may still be there...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Or perhaps, in consequence of your group being saved, your homeland may have met a different fate.
