That was our first big victory[sr]in a long time, Vice Commander!

＠Soldier
I had my doubts when we came to Ezo, but the way things are going now, we might just be able to drive those SatChou bastards back after all.
[k]

＠Hijikata
That's right. SatChou won't be getting through Futamataguchi while we're here defending it. Not a one of them's so much as setting foot in Hakodate.
[k]

＠Hijikata
You've all been doing great,[sr]especially for how few of you there are.
[k]

＠Hijikata
I wish I could give you a more fitting reward,[sr]but today you'll have to make do with booze.
[k]

＠Soldier
Fine with me![sr]I couldn't ask for a better reward right now.
[k]

＠Hijikata
Hey now, don't go getting so drunk you cause a ruckus.[sr]Keep it to one drink for today.
[k]

＠Soldier
Hahaha! Even after a victory like this you're still so strict! No wonder they call you the Demon Vice Commander!

I can't tell where the hell the[sr]memories begin and the illusions end.

Still, as far as I'm concerned,[sr]my Shinsengumi hasn't died yet.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Hijikata
Now, go on...

＠Hijikata
This next part is my own personal hell.[sr]A Shinsengumi of me, and me alone.

？1：...You're still going?
？2：But, isn't that part...

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Hijikata

＠Hijikata
No matter how hellish the battlefield gets,[sr]my loyalties will never die.
