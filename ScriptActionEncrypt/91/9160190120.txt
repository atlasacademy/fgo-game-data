I don't remember... I don't remember[sr]whether I beheaded her as she asked or not.
[k]

＠
I believe I would have been able to do it,[sr]but I regret that I could not.
[k]

＠
Both sentiments are there, giving me pain.

＠Danzo
I could never get used to being called Mother.
[k]

＠Danzo
Whenever I was called that,[sr]something inside me squeaked, so I...oiled it.
[k]

＠Danzo
I thought that, over time, being addressed[sr]that way would become second nature to me.
[k]

＠Danzo
Mother.[sr]Did I ever do anything to deserve that title?
[k]

＠Danzo
The only thing I did was continue to teach the techniques of the shinobi to each generation.
[k]

＠Danzo
Faster than yesterday, higher than yesterday,[sr]smarter than yesterday, stronger than yesterday.
[k]

＠Danzo
I was merely a being, a puppet, meant to make him that way. Ever since my own operational period ended, that was what I decided.
[k]

＠Danzo
I have no right to be called a mother.
[k]

＠B：???
No, you're wrong.
[k]

＠B：???
It was fine.[sr]That was enough.
[k]

＠B：???
We only had one objective.[sr]To complete the Fuuma clan.
[k]

＠B：???
So please do not belittle that fact.[sr]You did everything in your power.
[k]

＠B：???
And especially...whenever I perfected[sr]a technique, you always said to me:
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Danzo
Yes, excellent work, Lord Kotarou.
[k]

＠B：???
Those words alone were the greatest reward for me.[sr]That was all that I needed.
[k]

＠B：???
They held such strong sentiment. Even if it was as minute as a dew drop, that was enough. No, I didn't need anything more.
[k]

＠B：???
Had I been fulfilled, I wouldn't have become complete. Being hungry for the smallest of sentiment was enough.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Danzo
That's right.[sr]So, please...do not try to satisfy my needs.
[k]

＠Danzo
Your very existence is what fulfills me.[sr]Such sentiment is usually unnecessary to a shinobi.
[k]

＠Danzo
Oh, but...perhaps I had already...
[k]

＠Danzo
...served my purpose.[sr]And now that I'm not needed anymore, I am merely junk.
[k]

＠Danzo
Perhaps that's why I find something[sr]so simple so fulfilling.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
We're almost at the village of the Fuuma.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
This era was somewhat peaceful,[sr]but it was quite tumultuous for me personally.
[k]


[charaFace B 4]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Our days were not calm,[sr]and our fates unclear.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
We fought, we killed, we pillaged...[sr]We fought, we were killed, we were pillaged...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Despite our actions,[sr]we were all desperate to find our destiny.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
As we were searching for some shining place without light, we mindlessly practiced our techniques.
[k]


？1：Did you ever regret it?

[charaFace B 0]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
No. Absolutely not.[sr]I never had a single ounce of regret.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Just like you, Master.[sr]I have never felt regret.
[k]

？2：Nothing came of that?

[charaFace B 0]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
...Yes. You're absolutely right.[sr]Nothing at all came about from our efforts.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
In extreme terms, the name[sr]Fuuma left a mark in history.
[k]

？！

＠Fuuma Kotarou
...We've taken a bit of a detour it seems.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Were she here, she would be somewhere[sr]dark, where no light could reach.
[k]


＠Fuuma Kotarou
She did not like the sun, because she always[sr]believed that it mocked and ridiculed her.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
...But I never thought so. She was a beautiful combat doll, and she was the one person I opened up to.

Master, Kotarou...I'm getting an intense response.

I've scanned the topography.[sr]There seems to be a cave five hundred meters ahead.
[k]

＠Mash
She's likely there.

I did not like bright places.[sr]I hid that by saying it was because I was a shinobi.
[k]

＠
A lie that even children can see through.[sr]But I didn't want to be seen.
[k]

＠
I hated myself, more than anyone else.[sr]But without that hatred, I would not be a shinobi.
[k]

＠
A shinobi first and foremost works from the heart.[sr]Without it, I would just be an inanimate object.
[k]

＠
Voices...[sr]I hear voices.
[k]

＠
Oh, human voices.[sr]Don't come in here...
[k]

＠
Something dear to me is hidden here.[sr]Something special is sealed away.
[k]

＠
I must protect this place,[sr]or else I would no longer be Katou Danzo...

A shinobi is destined to disappear like dust.[sr]But...
[k]

Her lingering thoughts must have been used[sr]and manipulated by an abominable entity...

Of course.[sr]This is why I came along.
