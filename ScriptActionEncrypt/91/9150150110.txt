Get out if you can't pay![sr]I'm keeping this until you've got the money you owe!

Oww...What a violent man... The drink was cheap...[sr]And there were no pork cutlets either...

＠Amadeus
Oh, but losing my travel bag was a bad blow.[sr]I don't want him selling it to the pawn shop.

...Master, that's Amadeus lying on the ground in front of us.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
He appears to have been bounced out of the tavern[sr]like a pinball.
[k]

？1：What happened?

？2：You okay, scum?

？！

＠Amadeus
Oh dear. You've caught me at an embarrassing moment.[sr][%1], Mash, are you two getting lunch as well?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Amadeus
I would advice against that tavern.[sr]The meat and fish are excellent, but the drink is awful.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Amadeus
And the customer service is abysmal! What kind of[sr]establishment throws you out just because you can't pay?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Amadeus, did you go in there without any money?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Amadeus
Of course I did.[sr]I'm a genius composer.
[k]

＠Amadeus
God loves me and says I get[sr]an unlimited tab for everything.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Amadeus
But the owner here knows nothing about music![sr]He doesn't even have a single piano in his tavern!

Taverns in this era don't have pianos, obviously.[sr]From his perspective, you're the crazy one.

How am I crazy? I played him a song on my flute.[sr]It wasn't a full concert, but it should more than suffice.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
T-That sounds wonderful. I think a song from Amadeus[sr]would be worth a full day's meals, not just one.

Well, it's untitled, but if I gave it a name, perhaps,[sr]"A fugue to inspire sudden bowel movements."

＠Amadeus
As you can tell from my Noble Phantasm, it worked perfectly. It was hilarious seeing the line to the bathroom.

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
Senpai, he's bad news! He's the kind of[sr]Servant you can't let wander around on his own!
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Amadeus
Hahaha! You're making me blush![sr]Still, excellent timing.
[k]

＠Amadeus
I've had my revenge on the owner, but he took my bag of[sr]instruments. I need to make money quickly.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Amadeus
Will you come with me for a while?[sr]I just need a simple bodyguard.

Oh, there are bandits in this area that attack merchant[sr]wagons. If I get rid of them, I'll be paid in gold.
