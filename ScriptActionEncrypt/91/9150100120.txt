There's an underground space[sr]under the southern tip of Regent's Park...
[k]

＠Paracelsus
It's part of the underground facility for the Mage's[sr]Association[line2] Or rather, for Clock Tower.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Paracelsus
You could say it's one of their quarantine areas.[sr]There's something here that has been sealed.

Magical tomes[line 2][sr]This is basically what I'm referring to.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Paracelsus
In particular, there's one tome that was used to seal[sr]a powerful evil that almost manifested itself in this world.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
That tome, along with many other magical books,[sr]was carefully sealed with powerful spells.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
Even the spread of the Demonic Fog[sr]could not weaken the seals placed on the tomes.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Paracelsus
Just like other dangerous things that were sealed.[sr]However...

[k]

＠Paracelsus
The reason is that if I existed in this London[sr]and continued to pursue my designs[line 2]
[k]

＠Paracelsus
[line 2]I would break the seals without fail.

We are both real.[sr]I am thou... Thou art I.
[k]

＠Paracelsus?
The Servant Paracelsus beside you[sr]whom you duly summoned and made a contract with.
[k]

＠Paracelsus?
And I, born of Servant Paracelsus' magical energy[sr]that returned to the fog when you defeated him.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Paracelsus?
Both share the name "von Hohenheim."[sr]Both are real.
[k]

＠Paracelsus?
Admittedly, my existence[sr]is somewhat unstable.

[charaFace E 2]

At this rate, this era will be completely restored.[sr]If so, I cannot destroy it with my own hands.

My existence will likely disappear.[sr]However, I can't let that happen.
