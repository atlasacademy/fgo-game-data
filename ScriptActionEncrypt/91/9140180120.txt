Miss Quetzalcoatl took the first round. But will[sr]she be able to pull it off with her next opponent?

＠C：???
Yeah, well, I've got my reasons. I'm really not supposed to reveal my True Name all willy-nilly.
[k]

＠C：???
Think of me as...uh, the man of two thousand faces or somethin'... How 'bout you just call me Dos Mil Máscaras?
[k]

？1：Um, you've got a bunch of things all jumbled up!

＠Dos Mil Máscaras
Course I do. I'm that kinda guy.[sr]I've even lost count of how many faces I have.
[k]

？2：So, from the name, shouldn't you be wearing a mask or something?

＠Dos Mil Máscaras
Oh, I'm wearing a mask. You just can't see it because I'm silhouetted. You just don't get it, Master.

I figured he would be able to hold his ground even against Quetzalcoatl's aerial killer move.
[k]

＠Mash
And if we are to follow the tradition of Lucha Libre, we definitely need a rudo.

But fine! Let's do this![sr]That move you just showed, Señor Dos Mil Máscaras...

＠Dos Mil Máscaras
But are you really okay with this?[sr]Shouldn't I be the worst sort of opponent for you?
[k]

？1：Maybe in terms of class affinity!

＠Quetzalcoatl
Even if she's injured, a luchadora must[sr]project grace and power before her fans, yes!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
I won't go down easy, no matter what[sr]class you are! I'll prove that right now!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
And know that a luchadora is at her most terrifying on the brink of being knocked down!
