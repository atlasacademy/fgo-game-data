Sir Arash, you will think VERY carefully[sr]about how to address me in the future!
[k]

＠Nitocris
As I've had time to calm down, I will refrain from punishment THIS time, but never forget that I too am a pharaoh, and will brook no disrespect! Is that clear?

Yup, he's definitely here somewhere. Can't you feel that? That's a Servant aura if ever I sensed one.

＠Nitocris
Oh! Now that you mention it, I DO sense[sr]a Servant out beyond those clouds somewhere.
[k]

＠Nitocris
And this time, only one, thankfully.

＠Nitocris
So that must be...

Those magical energy signatures all vanished in an instant. I had a feeling you might have been responsible.

I take it you've been searching for me, Master?

King of Knights, who hails from another world,[sr]wielder of the sacred sword...

...if you are truly the second hero[sr]the great Pharaoh Ozymandias spoke of...

＠Nitocris
...I would humbly request that you present[sr]yourself before him. Please. I beg of you.

I was hoping to put off facing him until the last possible moment. I doubt we'll just be exchanging pleasantries. And, well, he's a fierce one.
[k]

＠Arthur
I'm concerned that one wrong word on my part could lead to Chaldea itself suffering the fallout.
[k]

＠Arthur
...Still, now that I think on it...I realize that Master will be present as well.

＠Arthur
Ah, and of course Archer, and you,[sr]the beautiful queen of Ozymandias's own land.

Very well then. I will meet with him.
