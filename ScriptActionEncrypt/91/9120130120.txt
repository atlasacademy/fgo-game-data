＠Arash
The forest can be a little rough at night.[sr]You'd feel better with some light, right?
[k]

？1：Hold on a second.
？2：I ran so fast I'm out of breath.

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arash
Yeah, take some rest. We ran, but that doesn't mean we've escaped from the enemy.
[k]

＠Arash
To survive in the forest, you need water, food, and a safe place to rest.
[k]

＠Arash
It's different than fighting in battle.
[k]

＠Arash
We've got some water and food, yeah?[sr]Not a lot, since this is a simulation.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Arash
I can keep us safe. There are no enemies around, and even if one randomly appears...
[k]

＠Arash
I'll protect us.[sr]Until you're ready for combat.
[k]

？1：Thanks.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arash
It's fine. I'm your Servant, you know.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arash
Sure can.[sr]I've got “good eyes.”

Rest when you can. Eat when you can. Even outside the forest, keep that in mind in order to fight.
[k]

＠Arash
I'm sure you know that by now, yeah?
[k]

＠Arash
You've Rayshifted many times already.[sr]You've retrieved many Grails from many eras.

Yeah, it's impressive.

You've fought a long time, right?[sr]Trying to save the world.

＠Arash
How are you doing? Are you feeling tired?
[k]


？1：It's kind of rough.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Arash
...I see.
[k]

＠Arash
That's right. It's okay to say how you're feeling.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Arash
You may be the only Master who can Rayshift, but well, you know...
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arash
There's a limit to how much a single person can do.
[k]

＠Arash
You have your Servants. You have Roman and Da Vinci at Chaldea.
[k]

＠Arash
And... you have Mash. She's your partner, and she worries about you more than anyone.
[k]

＠Arash
So don't try to do everything by yourself.[sr]When things get tough, you can say so.
[k]

＠Arash
It's not as if you're fighting alone.
[k]


？1：I've got you, too.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Arash
Yeah, that's right.
[k]

＠Arash
I'm here, too. If you need me, I'll be your strength.
[k]

＠Arash
If you're saving the world, I'll be at your side with my bow.

The world was still so small back then.[sr]So I told myself that maybe I could do it.
[k]

＠Arash
I was formed from remnants of the Age of Gods.[sr]I'm tougher than a human, and I possess some Mystics.
[k]

＠Arash
My limbs. My eyes. My knowledge.[sr]The Goddess gave me many things.
[k]

＠Arash
I fought. I fought alone, under the banner of the dragon-slaying king...
[k]

＠Arash
I kept fighting, to end a war that lasted decades.
[k]

＠Arash
Both my king's nation and the enemy were exhausted.[sr]A mess.
[k]

＠Arash
Nobody wanted to fight anymore.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

So I ended it.[sr]By myself.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arash
The king was worried about me, but in the end, I had subordinates but no friends.
[k]

＠Arash
There was no one I could call a comrade.
[k]

＠Arash
I chose to be alone myself.[sr]Being born more than a human, it's only natural.
[k]

＠Arash
Why, you ask? It's simple.
[k]

＠Arash
To me, humans were people I had to protect.[sr]So I kept my distance from them.

I can't be certain, and I have no proof.

[charaFace D 4]

But I think... he was so much greater a hero than any mortal man could be...

He was too strong. He was too pure.

Because of that, none could stand at his side.
