I've been thinking about this the whole time.[sr]It's because of you that I was able to fire that arrow.
[k]

＠Arjuna
I blamed all my cowardice, everything I did that was unbecoming of a true warrior...on you.
[k]

＠Arjuna
...At that time, I just wanted relief.[sr]I thought the battle with Karna was going to last forever.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Arjuna
The person I had been was being swallowed, and I despaired, knowing I was moving away from the path of a warrior.

But I must accept it. No matter how much I wish to resist, the one who fired that arrow was...

There is no correct answer. The only thing you can do is hold on to your conviction until the very end.

There will be times when you will feel lost.[sr]That is why we must walk the path with Master.

＠Karna
A Servant needs to live their second life carrying their doubts with them.

After all, you have never before reached this place where you now stand, not even in life.

＠Arjuna
But I must apologize, Master. The numerous times you were put in danger...all of it was because of me.
[k]

＠Arjuna
It is probably because the bond between you and I has grown stronger.
[k]

＠Arjuna
The deeper the bond I form with someone, the more fearful I become of them learning of the existence of my Krishna.
[k]

＠Arjuna
That's why I called you to my dream,[sr]and tried[charaFace A 5] to kill you.
[k]

＠Arjuna
I'm such a fool... A vile, detestable betrayer.[sr]I would not protest should I be put to death.

And I would also like to apologize for putting your life in danger.
[k]

＠Arjuna
But I am in something of a bind. The crime that I committed should cost me my life, but if I do offer up my life, I would not be able to fight for you anymore.

But now that I think about it...

I felt like I was on a long, long journey...[sr]Yet it seemed a short thing at the same time.

＠Arjuna
There is nothing absolute in this world.[sr]Various substances prowl, wander, and are transient.

Emotions are no exception.[sr]Even love can one day change to hate and sadness.

Or the opposite might happen.

But there is just one thing that I can say with confidence.

I am an Archer. My True Name is Arjuna.[sr]I am a Kshatriya warrior and a Servant...

I lend my strength to a Master in order to win back the future. I am just an average Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠
I am a descendant of a god, but not a god myself. I may have incredible power that ordinary humans lack, but I am still human.
[k]

＠
I simply fight. I fight for my Master.[sr]My reason for fighting is my belief in my Master.
[k]

＠
That is all I require to see myself as a hero. For that purpose, I can embrace the darkness within me and not be abashed by it.

I am an Archer.[sr]I am Arjuna.
