＠David
Ooof. Oh hey, [%1].[sr]Are you by chance looking for the Queen of Sheba?
[k]

＠David
Actually, in the hallway a few minutes ago...
[k]

？1：You ran into her?
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠David
...I did not. Hahaha!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠David
I had some business with her myself.[sr]She's the Queen of Sheba, after all.
[k]

＠David
She's the queen whose beauty was praised and noted in any number of texts and works of art. Even the Bible!
[k]

＠David
And now that beauty has come to Chaldea.[sr]I always meant to introduce myself to her!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠David
I would start off with a brisk “hello” and a pleasant conversation starter. Then, I would lock eyes with her and seal the deal by taking her hand.
[k]

＠David
You have to meet a person to know if[sr]you're compatible with them, you know.
[k]

？1：I don't know what you're talking about.
？2：So you're looking for someone to abi-shag...
？！

[charaFace A 2]

＠David
Hey, I'm passionate about this![sr]It's very important to me!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠David
With the help of a certain someone here (a fellow fan of bronze skin and fuzzy ears), I've done a bit of sleuthing.
[k]

＠David
First, I checked when the Queen appears in common areas. Then I looked into her favorite facilities and how she likes to get to them...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠David
But not once have I managed to meet her. Hrmmm...
[k]

＠David
I try to get a few steps ahead, but she always seems to see just what I'm planning, and so manages to evade me. I have only failed so far!
[k]

？1：That's impossible.

[charaFace A 0]

＠David
I'm not exaggerating. It's all true.
[k]

？2：I'll just go report you for stalking...

[charaFace A 1]

＠David
Oh, no. I wouldn't recommend that, Master. I'll have you know that I'm always innocent. My good looks always help me beat the rap.
[k]

＠David
But, should the security personnel be male, he may falsely accuse me out of sheer jealousy. How sad.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠David
Besides, I'm only acting on instinct. As a sheep herder, I'm inclined to gather any lost sheep[line 2]

＠David
Okay, fine! It's my fault![sr]Just put your phone away!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠David
...But honestly. Big as this place is, failing to run into someone at least once seems odd...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠David
Maybe it's because...she's using her power of looking into the future or something...
[k]

？1：Maybe it's annoying enough that going so far is all she can do...
？！

＠David
You think it's annoying?[sr]But this handsome guy is so desperate!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠David
I know my actions can be problematic, but don't you think it's funny when you think about it? That fact I, for once, am failing?
[k]

＠David
Don't you think that's a sight to behold?[sr]Oh, I hope the Queen of Sheba thinks so too.
[k]

？1：King David's optimism scares me.
？2：I wouldn't say anything if you weren't out of line.
？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠David
Thanks for that uninspiring word of encouragement, Master. I'll just have to patiently wait for my encounter like a gentleman.

But would you mind giving me a hand in calming her down? I will repay you generously.
