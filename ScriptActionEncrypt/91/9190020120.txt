But I did that subconsciously. My own body didn't realize what it was doing.

＠Amakusa Shirou
But faith is a strange thing. After I died and became a Heroic Spirit, I was able to perform miracles.

＠Amakusa Shirou
By miracles, I mean my original Noble Phantasms, “Right Hand - Evil Eater” and “Left Hand - Xanadu Matrix.”

I was born with the ability to use magecraft.[sr]However, no one around me could tell its true nature...

And so I was worshipped as a miracle.

Perhaps Mori Souiken kept the rumors from spreading too far.

At this point, there's no way to know the truth...

From what you're telling me about your magecraft and its uniqueness, the Mage's Association at the time wouldn't have let you be, no.
