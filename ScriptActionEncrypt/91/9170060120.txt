I don't think that was one of his skills, but Sakata Kintoki was just tearing those Phantasmals apart.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Stories say he's a hero that took a bear down as a child, so it makes sense that he's this strong as an adult.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Sakata Kintoki, are you hiding any Anti-Phantasmal skills?
