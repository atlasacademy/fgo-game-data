Am I really me? How do I know I'm[sr]not actually someone else's puppet?

Maybe this world is fake, and I'm just a brain in a jar imagining the whole thing...

The Shinjuku Singularity has already been repaired.

＠Mash
So no matter what might be going on here,[sr]it won't have any effect on humanity...

[charaFace B 12]
＠Mash
Still, we don't know why a single[sr]Servant decided to Rayshift here.
[k]

＠Mash
The Assassin of Shinjuku. True Name: Yan Qing...
[k]

？1：I wonder what's going on with him.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Mash
I'm afraid all we know right now[sr]is that he Rayshifted here.
[k]

？2：You're sure he came to Shinjuku?

[charaFace B 0]
＠Mash
Yes.
[k]

＠Mash
We were tracking his Spirit Origin up till he disappeared here.
[k]

＠Mash
However, there were some, um, irregularities with the tracking data, so I don't know if we can trust it entirely.

Hassan of the Cursed Arm and Geronimo have come along to serve as your guides.
