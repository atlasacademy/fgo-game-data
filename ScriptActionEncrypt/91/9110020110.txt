＠Dr. Roman
A Rayshift into the heart of the Fuyuki Greater Grail?[sr]It's not impossible, but why?

＠Mash
I'm told it's a urgent request from Saber.[sr]Right, Senpai?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Haha, we can't turn down a request from the corrupted[sr]Saber, can we? That King of Knights is merciless.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
But the space inside the Greater Grail isn't stable.[sr]If you do a Rayshift, you'll likely get punted back out.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Well, I'm sure Saber has something in mind.[sr]Let's get started.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Mash, take care of [%1].[sr]If things get dangerous, let me know right away.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
That's the plan.[sr]Let's start the Rayshift, Senpai.

Are we in...France?[sr]I thought we shifted into the Greater Grail...

Doctor? Doctor?[sr]Come in... Doctor?

？1：We can't contact him?

...So it seems.[sr]He said it was spatially unstable, but where are we[line 3]

Fou!

Fou agrees, but...I can't be sure.[sr]I can't even establish a connection.
[k]

＠Mash
The inside of the Greater Grail is like a singularity, and the connection won't be stable, he said. But where are we[line 3]

We're inside Greater Grail in a fragment that doesn't exist. Think of it as a place that recreates beings that became the singularities.

Saber? You arrived first?

So you came too, Kyrielight? ...Alright, I suppose. Thank you for answering my wish, [%1].
[k]

＠Saber Alter
I'm amazed you believed in me enough to Rayshift inside the Greater Grail.
[k]

？1：I want an explanation.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Saber Alter
There's no need for one.[sr]What you need are strong Servants.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
I'm simply granting you that wish.
[k]

？2：If it's what you want, Saber.

＠Saber Alter
...I see.[sr]If that's how you feel, then I won't hold back.
