＠El-Melloi
Didn't even break a sweat. You don't[sr]consider them enemies anymore, huh?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
...Hmm, growth as a mage is unlikely, but[sr]it looks like you're gaining experience as a Master.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
It's good to be diligent. All right,[sr]I will give you this as a reward for your efforts.

Is this...a jewel?[sr]It appears to be an expensive Mystic Code...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
It's not. It's just a common protective ore.[sr]On top of that, it's a used one from me.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
I pocketed it as a precaution when I was young, but I don't need it anymore.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
No one will acknowledge your effort anyway, right?[sr]That's why I'm giving it to you as a reward.

Hey, calm down there![sr]My student showed progress, it's natural!

Look what you did! Now my expensive suit is ruined![sr]Not to mention that my hair is sticky from the sea breeze.

I shouldn't have come to the beach.[sr]Who's dumb enough to want to come here?

Mr. El-Melloi just left...

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
He must see his younger self when he looks at you, Senpai.
[k]

？1：In that case, I'm honored...

？2：...I'm not that eccentric...

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Yes, here you go Senpai.[sr]A gift from your teacher.
[k]

＠Mash
He said that it was used, but I'm positive that he prepared it just for you.
[k]

＠Mash
Let's fight and not give up! Let's meet our teacher's expectations!
