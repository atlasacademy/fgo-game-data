I was not empress of all China for nothing. This sort of exercise is...trivial... (Cough, gasp, gasp)...

Unfortunately, I haven't found many other players to test it yet...

...so I'm afraid it might be too difficult to complete without an empress's powerful will.

Oh, I don't think that will be a problem. That's something for the customer to worry about, not the seller.

Just put all that in some fine print in the manual and you'll be aaall set.
