Huh? What? Are you keeping secrets?[sr]Come on, you have to tell me, too!
[k]

＠Orion
...It's not a secret, but, um, well, you see...
[k]

＠Orion
...Basically, don't you think that all these monsters who show up in this world are our fault?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Artemis
[line 2]Huh?
[k]

＠Orion
I mean, I'm nothing special,[sr]but you're supposedly a god, right?
[k]

＠Orion
Even if not in your Divine Form, you still have some influence on this world.
[k]

＠Orion
Distorting it, opening holes and what have you...
[k]

＠Orion
So it's kind of obvious that weird things are gonna pour out from there[line 2]
[k]

＠Artemis
...So what?[sr]I'm not allowed to go to other worlds?
[k]

＠Artemis
...Only where a Holy Grail War is being fought?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Orion
Well, I guess... that's how things look.

[charaFace D 5]
＠Artemis
I mean, I thought we could finally, finally go outdoors on a date!
[k]

＠Artemis
Without having to sneak behind Big Brother's back!
[k]

＠Artemis
I wanted to hold hands, and hug, and make out and stuff!

Does it really matter?

＠Artemis
Does what...matter?
[k]

＠Orion
Does it matter if there are enemies?[sr]It doesn't mean you and I can't go out.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Artemis
Huh?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Orion
I mean, you're one of the gods of Olympus![sr]Does a god really care if she causes others trouble!?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Artemis
B-But I can't do that!
[k]

＠Orion
You retaliated a hundredfold to those that peeked on you when you were taking a bath, didn't you?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Artemis
(Sob) You've got me there![sr]But I was embarrassed!
[k]

＠Orion
Then it doesn't matter![sr]What kind of god cares what happens to other people?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Artemis
But[line 2]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Orion
One more thing! ...Throw those stupid worries that I'm going to hate you into Hades or something!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Orion
It's too late! It's way too late for me to hate you for stuff like that now, dummy!

＠Artemis
So I'm allowed to cause a little bit of trouble, right? 'Cause I'm a god!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
