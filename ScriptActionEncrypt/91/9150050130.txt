Ohhhh, our prey is coming to us![sr]Guys, this is a non-stop party!
[k]

＠Pirate
Should we strip them? Or strangle them? Ridicule them?[sr]Whatever. Let's just kill them and let off some steam!

Hahaha. Sorry, I underestimated the pirates' IQs.[sr]I had no idea how dumb they actually are.

＠Andersen
They aren't worth observing. I'm going home.[sr]You guys go ahead and beat them up for me.
[k]

＠Andersen
They may be a memory of the sea, but they're still[sr]humans. Beat them to a pulp, and make them regret their actions.

＠Mash
You don't have to tell us! We'll do that![sr]And you should reflect on your deeds for once, too!

[charaFace D 1]
＠Andersen
Gotcha. Oh, Mash, about the sequel to The Little[sr]Mermaid, can I base the Prince on those pirates?
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
Absolutely not!
