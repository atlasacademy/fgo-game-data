＠Sakata Kintoki
...Just what I was waitin' for.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Looks like you're holdin' on to your sense of self just fine. I knew I didn't have to worry about you, Master.
[k]

？1：So, we're inside Raikou's head...?

？！

[charaFace A 3]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Yup. This is her mindscape.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
If you're wonderin' why it's so freakin' dark in here, that'll be 'cause she's lost sight of everythin' else.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Sorry for bringin' ya along for the ride on such short notice.
[k]

？1：Why would you be sorry about that?
？2：Don't be silly. Of course I'd come.

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Thanks, Master.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Your body's prolly deep asleep by now.[sr]Y'know, like that REM REM thing you do...
[k]

？1：You mean that thing where I sometimes end up in someone else's dream?
？2：REM REM...

？！

＠Sakata Kintoki
They might seem similar,[sr]but they ain't the same by half.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Strictly speakin', this is Murasaki's spell at work. Though I guess she's really just copyin' one of Seimei's tricks.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
We're pretty much here to do[sr]a sorta exorcism type thing.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
They say there's a buncha different ways ta do that, and one of those feels exactly like what we got here.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
What ya do is, you go inside whoever's been possessed and try to suspend your conscious mind to be able to see more clearly. I think it's been called somethin' or other Meditation.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sakata Kintoki
These days, I think I'd call it the Golden Mind Dive.[sr]Got it?
[k]

？1：More or less.
？2：All too well.

？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
...Yeah.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Usually, this sorta spell wouldn't work on a Servant at all. Unless the Caster usin' it really knew their stuff, it'd just bounce right offa them.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
The fact that this one's workin' on Raikou just proves that, even with all the magical energy she's givin' off...
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
...her Spirit Origin's still pretty damn unstable right now. Hell, forget her Spirit Origin.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
If she's givin' off this much magical energy,[sr]she's prolly burnin' her Spirit Core for fuel.
[k]

？1：That can't be good.
？2：We've got to stop her, fast!

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Damn straight!
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Well, whaddaya say we head on down? With these kinds of things, you've usually gotta work your way deep into the mindscape...

＠Sakata Kintoki
Ya know, the Raikou we saw earlier...
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
There was somethin' different about her than when Ushi Gozen showed up. It was like... How can I put this...
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Back in the Heian period,[sr]we'd call it the “inverted dragon scale.”
[k]

？1：What's that?
？！

＠Sakata Kintoki
Basically, it's a weak point you really,[sr]really don't want anyone else touching. Like a dragon's Achilles' heel.
[k]

？1：Oh, like a sore spot?
？！

＠Sakata Kintoki
Sorta. It's a real sore spot.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I figured I was gonna hafta tell ya about this[sr]at some point, so I might as well do it now.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
First off, Raikou...isn't actually our mom.
[k]

？1：Uh-huh...

＠Sakata Kintoki
Yeah.
[k]

？2：Yeah, I...uh... That had occurred to me...

＠Sakata Kintoki
...Right. 'Course it would.[sr]'Sides, you've already got a mom.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I had a different mom, too...though she was already dead by the time I met Raikou.
[k]

？！

＠Sakata Kintoki
But, Raikou can't help but be motherly,[sr]especially as a Berserker.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Best I can tell, I'd say the Raikou we know is on the younger side, long before she became the great Genji leader.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
She'd always refer to herself as a mother, and she took real good care of me, even though she couldn't've been even ten years older than me.

It's all right, Master. I want ya to understand.[sr]And not just because you're her Master.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I want ya to really understand who Raikou is because you're one of the most important people in her life.

＠Sakata Kintoki
See, Raikou's mother saved her life, but at the cost of her own. So Raikou grew up never knowin' a mother's love.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
That's why she's so fixated on her[sr]ideal of what it means to be a mother.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
...I think that's why she wants ta be one herself.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
But her old man, representing the previous generation, wouldn't have it.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
He said that Raikou is the leader of the Genji, an' so, had ta be a man, not a woman.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
...Never mind that he ended up strippin' the title from her right at the end.
[k]

？1：...

？！

＠Sakata Kintoki
...Pretty awful, right?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Even today, the history books say Minamoto-no-Raikou was a man who had lotsa kids with lotsa wives.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
She still hasn't really come to terms with that.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
...Deep down, she's still an innocent maiden who never had anyone explain that sorta thing to her.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
That's why it's such a sore spot with her[line 2]kinda taboo, really[line 2]for anyone to mention her historical kids around her.
[k]

？1：So that's what caused this...
？2：So when Shikibu brought up Yorikuni and Yoriie...

？！

＠Sakata Kintoki
There ya have it.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
She never really understood or accepted it, but she still had to live her life as the leader of the Genji.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
And well...that was her way of handling it.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
That ain't Ushi Gozen.[sr]It's somethin' completely different.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I guess ya could call it her ultra-golden-dangerous work mode. When she gets like this, she's completely focused on protectin' Kyoto from evil, to the exclusion of anythin' else.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
She ain't too chatty in this mode. Just goes about killin' her enemies with overwhelmin' power.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I call that version of Raikou...the lone warrior.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
In this mode, she's one of the most powerful warriors to ever live, a lone wolf who just goes around mercilessly killing any enemies of the state, be they human or inhuman.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
She doesn't think like a person.[sr]Hell, she doesn't even eat.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
All she does is fight. That's it.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
She just fights, and fights, and keeps on fighting.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
It's her ultimate un-golden way of escapin' from reality... She pretty much just throws herself into her job so she doesn't hafta think about anythin' else!
[k]

？1：S-so she's a real work fiend...or a work oni, in this case...

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Oh, yeah, I guess she is, isn't she.
[k]

？2：So she's a workaholic!?

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sakata Kintoki
That's it. I knew there was a word for it.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
We all need to forget about bad stuff now and then, but the way she's goin' about it now, it won't be long 'fore she works herself to death.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
That almost happened back when she was still alive.[sr]Now that she's a Heroic Spirit...
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
...she'll prob'ly keep fightin' until she disappears 'cause she burned through all her magical energy.
[k]

？1：Then we'll just have to stop her before that happens.

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Didn't hesitate for a second, huh.[sr]I knew I could count on ya, Boss!
