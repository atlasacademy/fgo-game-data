＠Emiya
What a disaster...[sr]What kind of Holy Grail War happened here?
[k]

＠Emiya
No sign of the Mage's Association or Holy Church, which means a battle royale among the Masters.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Emiya
They probably misused their Servants, and let them do whatever they want.
[k]

＠Emiya
[%1], make sure you control your Servants, so you don't end up with a mess like this.
[k]

？1：Control my Servants?

？2：Is it wrong to let them do what they want?

？！

[charaFace D 5]
＠Emiya
Use your Command Spells to keep them in check.[sr]If they're up to something, teach them a lesson, or make them fight.
[k]

＠Emiya
Many Masters use their Command Spells to force their Servants to commit suicide as a safety measure.
[k]

＠Emiya
When a Master realizes a Heroic Spirit is "too much to handle," using the Spells that way can save many lives.

＠Mash
I see... It's true that there are many Servants[sr]who just want to cause destruction.
[k]

＠Mash
Most Berserkers are like that.[sr]I didn't realize you could use a Spell that way.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
As expected of the great Emiya, a true veteran who's been through many Holy Grail Wars.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Emiya
Y-Yeah. Well, when it comes to Holy Grail Wars,[sr]I know more than your average Servant.

＠Emiya
Ahem. All right [%1], this is a good chance. I'm going to give you a proper lecture.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Emiya
...Of course, Dr. Roman has already taught[sr]you what you need to know about combat.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Emiya
So this time, I'll teach you about something you won't see in the stats, a Heroic Spirit's...attributes.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Emiya
Heroic Spirits can be divided into four main categories.[sr]"Human", "Earth", "Heaven," and "Star."
[k]

＠Emiya
Those under the "Human" category are people born after AD, and praised as heroes after their death because of their great deeds in life.
[k]

＠Emiya
Some of them were actual super humans when alive, but most of them were only glorified after death.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Emiya
Andersen, Shakespeare, Robin Hood, and Lady Nightingale would all be examples.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Emiya
Next, the "Earth" category.[sr]These are heroes spoken of in local folklore[line 3]

＠Dr. Roman
(...This feels like another long talk.[sr][%1], is he always like this?)
[k]

？1：Sometimes he gets this way.

[communicationCharaClear]
[wait communicationChara]
[charaFace A 12]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Mash
Yes. He's normally quiet and serious, but from time to time he gets very nosy.
[k]

＠Mash
He sort of talks too much.[sr]That's our Emiya.
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]
？2：His attribute is "talky mom."

[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
I see... Talky mom attribute, eh?[sr]We'll just have to let him talk till he's done then.
[k]

[communicationCharaClear]
[wait communicationChara]

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠Emiya
The fourth category "Star," is where things get important.
[k]

＠Emiya
The "Star" is a special category. It represents[sr]mankind's hope and symbolizes overcoming hardship.
[k]

＠Emiya
This category might seem powerful as it has no weakness against the other three, but its true nature lies elsewhere.
[k]

＠Emiya
There's another category equal to the "Star."[sr]That's the fifth[line 3]

They must have smelled us.[sr]They'll make contact in 20 seconds!
