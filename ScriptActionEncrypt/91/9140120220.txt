I think so. Last I saw,[sr]he was out walking there past the dust clouds.

＠Arash
It was quite a sight. He was walking around cool as you please, even in that heavy armor of his.
[k]

＠Arash
Actually, y'know, I think he was wearing a coat or something, too. He had a...thing over his head and I'm pretty sure it wasn't a helmet.

＠Nitocris
Hmm, I see... Then we might find him[sr]somewhere past these dust clouds...

They're hostile AIs. They don't give off the same aura as a Servant. Guess we'll just have to do something about them first.
