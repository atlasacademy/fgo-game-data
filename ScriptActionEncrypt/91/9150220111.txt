As there are laws in Buddhist teachings, so too are there laws in this world, and passions may lead to enlightenment!

Now is probably not your time to stop hurting others and gain salvation, but I believe that time will one day come for you.

You guys never cease to amaze. I was watching as you beat the crap out of the source of the abnormality.

＠Da Vinci
Was it a coincidence? Or is it Sanzang's special ability? Did she manage to detect where the abnormality was located?

But, I'm sorry.

I roped you into this...I'm sorry to have made you worry when we were alone in the woods at night.

＠Sanzang
You have many roles, and you are a busy person. You're the last person I should drag into my whimsical stuff.

This time around...yep![sr]I'm reflecting back on my actions!

I won't do it again. Next time, it's not going[sr]to be the two of us. I've learned my lesson!

That's why we should go with everyone next time![sr]I'm sure we won't get lost then!

Yes! Let's bring more people along so we can assign them to be the lookout or make them do the cooking.
