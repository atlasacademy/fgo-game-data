It is about Lord Yagyu Tajima-no-kami.[sr]He has been acting strangely as of late.

？！

＠Chiyome
To elaborate, he has become an extremely...enthusiastic user of the combat simulator.

He used to train in there no more than once or twice a month, but these last few days, he has been in there at all hours.

In fact, he just activated the simulator and set it to[sr]a completely random time and location not too long ago.
