I'm not sure myself. But we're not in Chaldea, nor any recognizable era.

＠Cú Chulainn
Must be Scáthach's doing. We've finally been invited into the Land of Shadows. I apologize on behalf of my mentor, since I'm kind of involved here.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
There's nothing for you to apologize for...[sr]Oh,[charaFace A 0] so this is the Land of Shadows?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Cú Chulainn
No, it's slightly different than the place I once visited.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
It's not the Isle of Skye. It's like a remnant of the Land of Shadows when it was still connected to the real world, but it's different somehow.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
The part where the air is filled with frigid magical energy is about right, though.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Cú Chulainn
...Which means, we were dragged into my mentor's memory, or something like that.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
Memory?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Cú Chulainn
I'm not sure if this was deliberate or not, though.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Either way, even if this is just a memory, the Land of Shadows isn't somewhere we should linger.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
If things go badly, we'll all be swallowed up and die, including Master. The world will end, and we'll all end up in the gutter.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]

＠Mash
No...!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Cú Chulainn
Eh, don't worry. This is just carelessness on her part.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
It wouldn't have been an issue if it was just me, but I can't let the both of you get sucked into this.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Which means, we need to exterminate that nuisance of a woman. Let's go take her out!
