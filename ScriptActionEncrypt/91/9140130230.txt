My queen is a woman of few words,[sr]so allow me to elaborate on her behalf.
[k]

＠Fergus
Queen Medb, the former ruler of Connacht, once competed with her husband, Ailill, to see who had the best possessions.
[k]

＠Fergus
Their treasure alone wasn't enough to settle the score, so the next thing they compared was livestock.
[k]

＠Fergus
Unfortunately for Medb, she did not have a cow that could match up to Ailill's incredible steer, Finnbhennach.

[charaFace A 6]

Well, I'm at least as much of a[sr]goddess as any old Greek bimbo.

＠Medb
I'm the undisputed queen of Connacht. My subjects worship me, I rule over them with a benevolent iron fist, and they show no mercy to any who might threaten our land.

What's a little pissant goddess holed up on a tiny island in the middle of nowhere compared to that?
