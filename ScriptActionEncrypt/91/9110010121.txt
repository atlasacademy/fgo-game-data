Thank you for accepting my wish to see Fuyuki.

＠Altria
Let us return to Chaldea, Master. I'm sure there[sr]are other matters we should be attending now.
[k]

？1：Yes, of course.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Just a moment.[sr]You haven't finished your story.
[k]

？2：...Before we go, tell us one more thing.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Altria
One more thing?
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Altria
Of course, I told you how I became a king, but I haven't told you why.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Altria
My aspiration to be king despite being a woman.[sr]...And for what reasons did I fight?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Altria
However, it is a simple, trivial matter. I am sure it is[sr]the same as you, dear [%1].
[k]

＠Altria
I did not fight for ideals.[sr]I fought for the future.
[k]

＠Altria
One that everyone wishes for, everyone desires[sr]for. My hand reached for this sword to protect that.
[k]

＠Altria
I am not sure if I did a good job.[sr]But I did my best and laid down my life for that dream.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...You have no regrets for how your life ended as King Arthur?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Altria
I have some disappointments, but no regrets.
[k]

＠Altria
My battle was not the correct salvation for everything[line 3]But I am certain it wasn't a mistake.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Altria
From this point forward it is your battle, Master.[sr]I swear on my sword, I will be there to assist you.
