＠Robin Hood
Hahaha, you're a greedy one, huh Master?[sr]Let's move on to the next trap then.

Quietly, quietly...Oh, this one too.[sr]Although this is one I hoped they wouldn't trigger.

You hoped they wouldn't trigger?

＠Robin Hood
Yeah, unlike the other place, there are signs of people staying here.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
They're pros too, so they've hidden themselves well,[sr]but... See? 3, 2, 1, 0.

GYAAAAHHH![sr]A trap! A hidden pit!
[k]

＠Soldier
Scouts, what were you doing? There's spear[sr]tips smeared with cow dung on the bottom!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
I hear terrible screaming![sr]Robin, what was that?
[k]

？1：Damn, enemy soldiers!

？2：Damn! Definitely not a bonus character!

？！

＠Robin Hood
These guys were getting ready to attack the town.[sr]See? This is important, too.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
If we can get rid of them here, they can't hurt the town and the enemy won't know our location.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Just like they said, scouts are the most basic and critical part of war.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Robin Hood
A bonus is important, but you need basic recon work[sr]too. Don't forget that, Master.
[k]

＠Mash
Y-Yeah. Robin is right![sr]This is important too! No, it's more important!
[k]

？1：Yeah, let's go, Mash!

？2：Damn it! Let's do this, Mash!

？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
Roger[line 3]I'll change my feeling of[sr]misplaced hope into rage, Master!
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Oh, how brave![sr]Let's do this nice and easy. Nice and easy.
