As soon as it explodes, it will properly establish itself as a Holy Grail.

Hey pretty boy.[wt 1][charaFace E 0][sr]Is this my first time meeting you? It is, right?

＠???
I'm a sewer rat, born from the mud.[sr]I got no business with a saint!
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

＠???
But... I see.[sr]I can see you've led a hard life.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠???
That Heroic Spirit smell you're giving off is pretty damn close to my own!
[k]

＠???
And that exhaustion you just can't shake? Clear as day! That tired state of mind leaves you open to danger...
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠???
...but I guess we can't help it!

You chose to go through all that![sr]Nobody will sympathize with you!

An iron will... No, more like the power to get things done, eh? I'm weak to that stuff. In the sense that it makes me want to puke.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠???
So...? My being born means that someone here wants this Grail...
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠???
Who is it? Who's the tasteless human?[sr]You?

？1：No way.
？！

＠???
I know, right!?[sr]I mean, didn't think it'd be you!

And it's not that delicious tender-looking Servant over there, either.

No human, good or evil, can handle the power to save the world.

Right, Master?[sr]Did my words move you?

Master, please decide.

＠Amakusa Shirou
Will you let me take care of this incomplete Grail?

I see.[sr]That leaves me no choice.

Especially the way you'll do whatever it takes!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠???
But our black-caped recruit always puts so much effort into aesthetics.
[k]

＠???
You're colder, and more efficient. Which makes you impossible to persuade.
[k]

＠???
Master, you're gonna have to defeat him.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠???
And when a Ruler gets out of hand, what you need is an Avenger to stop them!
[k]

＠???
Lucky you! You won the chance to try out a rare dark Servant!
[k]

＠???
I won't last the night anyway.[sr]Might as well die in style!
