Enemy response, zero.[sr]No problems on our end. I recommend returning.

By the way, Master, was there something on my face a few minutes ago?

At least on my end, I did not see any fluctuations in his Spirit Origin value. Perhaps it's fatigue?

＠Mash
Arjuna, you've been volunteering for battle rather frequently recently.
[k]

＠Mash
And the other Servants, especially the battle-hungry ones, have been complaining that it's not fair.

Ah-ha, Senpai. I win in this round of cards.[sr]I will be taking this sesame bun as my prize.

...S-Servants don't gain weight.[sr]That applies to Demi-Servants, too!

Hehe. Don't sulk, Senpai.[sr]I have one for you, too.

You're finally awake, Master.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arjuna
...I am surprised.
[k]

＠Arjuna
You do not seem at all bewildered by the unexpected scene you just witnessed.
[k]

＠Arjuna
It seems that we have fallen into a Servant's dream. It's likely that it's my dream, or that of someone who has some connection with me.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Arjuna
If it's mine...then I apologize in advance.
[k]

？1：I'm used to it. This happens a lot.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Arjuna
Spoken like a true Master.[sr]But getting too used to this is hardly a good thing.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arjuna
You may one day be a prisoner of a different type of nightmare... Should you die inside a dream, your spirit will perish.
[k]

？2：I'm in a dream again, aren't I?

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arjuna
When you say “again,” do you mean you fall into the dreams of others often?
[k]

＠Arjuna
This is neither a Rayshift nor a case of teleportation.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Arjuna
It's truly a curious phenomenon...[sr]But this is a first for me.
[k]


？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arjuna
Anyway, we can do little if we remain in this darkness. We must analyze our surroundings.
[k]

＠Arjuna
Master, do not move. If we lose sight of each other, it will be difficult for us to find one another again.
[k]

＠Arjuna
...It's subtle, but I sense a breeze.[sr]Let's head in that direction.

This place is like a labyrinth...and it's quite elaborate.
[k]

＠Arjuna
Not only that...[charaFace B 5] No...one moment.
[k]

＠Arjuna
This is not right.[sr]I do not understand.
[k]

？1：What's wrong?
？！

＠Arjuna
My only sense of this is, I admit, intuitive, but this labyrinth does not lead any higher than we are now.
[k]

＠Arjuna
The only path leads lower...to the bottom.
[k]

？1：So there's no exit?

[branch sel01a]

？2：Seems about right for a dungeon in a nightmare...

[branch sel01b]

？！

[label sel01a]
[charaFace B 0]
＠Arjuna
Yes, exactly. It's nonsensically structured, as only dreams can be.
[k]

[branch sel01c]

[label sel01b]
＠Arjuna
Honestly.[sr][charaFace B 4]My apologies. This is most likely my own nightmare.
[k]

＠Arjuna
Were this your nightmare,[sr]it wouldn't have been as malicious as it is now.
[k]

？1：My nightmare... Eli's last supper. With live music.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arjuna
Is this Eli the mixed dragon Servant? Hahaha[charaFace B 1]. A concert festival certainly sounds interesting.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Arjuna
Eh? A nightmare? Isn't it just music?[sr]What? I don't get the underlying issue?
[k]

[branch sel01c]

？2：My nightmare would be Nightingale disinfecting me.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Arjuna
That...is terrifying.
[k]

＠Arjuna
My own mother, perhaps reflective of the times, spoiled me. Yet I still feel maternal love from Nightingale's fierceness.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Arjuna
Either way, isn't it nice to know the Servant is genuinely concerned for you?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Arjuna
A dream where she chases after you with a tank of disinfectant on her back? ...I see, that IS a nightmare...
[k]

[branch sel01c]

？！

[label sel01c]
[charaFace B 0]
＠Arjuna
Anyway, let's begin our descent.[sr]I have a feeling that that is our best option.

We should have no trouble breaking through.[sr]Now then, let us cut them down.
