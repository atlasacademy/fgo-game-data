Hmm, hmm, hmm.[sr]I see, I see.
[k]

＠Inshun
So he is somehow me, but also not me...
[k]

＠Inshun
...Lancer of Purgatorio.
[k]

？1：I'd rather not think about him too much...

[charaFace A 4]
＠Inshun
I understand.[sr]I am very sorry about this, [%1].
[k]

？2：Sorry we don't really have much on him...

[charaFace A 1]
＠Inshun
Not at all. This is more than enough.[wt 0.5][sr]Hmm, I see he was quite the monster.[charaFace A 0]
[k]

？！

Can I ask what brought this up, Inshun? What made you want to see the information on Shimousa now...?

＠Inshun
A fair question.
[k]

＠Inshun
As I see it, one could make a compelling case[sr]for Lancer of Purgatorio's sins being my own.
[k]

＠Inshun
Despite being summoned as a Heroic Spirit...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Inshun
...it was my own strength that made me a target[line 2]a catalyst to facilitate my fall to Lancer of Purgatorio.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Inshun
That will never do. It is a far more miserable fate than[sr]I could have ever imagined.
[k]

？1：But, that wasn't your fault...

[charaFace A 0]
＠Inshun
Indeed not.
[k]

？2：You have a pretty intense sense of personal responsibility!

[charaFace A 0]
＠Inshun
I am a monk first, you know.[sr]Even before I am a hero.
[k]

？！

＠Inshun
Of course, I have no memory whatsoever of[sr]the time I spent as Lancer of Purgatorio.
[k]

＠Inshun
So, from my perspective...
[k]

＠Inshun
...it is no different than having a doppelgänger going around causing destruction in my name.
[k]

＠Inshun
However, Master, there is one aspect of this[sr]in particular that I absolutely cannot abide.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Inshun
This evil doppelgänger of mine cannot[line 2]must not be stronger than me.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Inshun
For if giving myself over to evil made my spear techniques that much sharper, I would have no choice but to do so.
[k]

＠Inshun
Of course, I would see it as a failure, as I would have given up my humanity.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Inshun
But had I learned of it while I was alive...I cannot say for certain that I could have resisted the temptation that would have offered.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Inshun
Indeed, I cannot be certain at all.[sr]And that worries me!
[k]

＠Inshun
Lady Musashi was kind enough to assure me that[sr]I was definitely stronger than Purgatorio...
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Inshun
[f large]...but that is not enough!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Inshun
No, I believe the only choice left to me now[sr]is to prove it in the simulator.
[k]

＠Inshun
It is possible to do that, yes?[sr]If I can converse with him there too, so much the better.
[k]

＠Inshun
This way, I can find out which of us is[sr]stronger...me, or my evil doppelgänger.
[k]

？1：...All right, I can see you've made up your mind.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Inshun
Indeed, I have.[sr]Thank you for indulging me, Master!
[k]

？2：Okay, let's do it!

[charaFace A 1]
＠Inshun
Wonderful! No evil version of me will[sr]ever get the better of my true self!
[k]

...Now I see. Fighting Lancer of Purgatorio[sr]really is something you need to do for yourself.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]
＠Mash
Understood.[sr]I'll boot up the simulator right now!
