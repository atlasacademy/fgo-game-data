Still, this forest[line 2][sr]It seems different than the one in my country.

＠Mash
That's right. From the look of that coast...[sr]Are we on a deserted island?
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
You're probably right, Mash.[sr]There's likely no land bridge.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Ushiwakamaru
If we're trapped here, should we chop some wood and make a raft?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
If we can Rayshift back, we probably won't need a raft.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Too bad.[sr]I'm quite good at chopping wood[line 2]
