...Hm. Now that I've fought against some, I understand. This is no battle. This is some kind of cataclysm.

There's no passion in the enemy's fist. No emotion nor warm blood coursing through them. They are like locusts or portents of disaster. They are no warriors.

Indeed. With another conquest up ahead, it seems we need to settle this matter first.

Ah yes! Now this is what Servant cooperation is all about! See how negotiation can make anything possible, Mash?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
To be honest, I was on guard when I heard the King of Macedonia was here, but he's quite the man! He's so heroic, but not too rough!
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

I wouldn't call it negotiation...[sr]I feel like the fight convinced him.

And what kind of preparations do you have in mind?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Iskandar
First and foremost, information from literature.[sr]And a map.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
...I'm a little surprised that you'd be so meticulous in forming military strategies.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Iskandar
Obviously. A guide is necessary when exploring foreign lands. Maybe not an interpreter, but I do want literature to help steer our way.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Iskandar
Prepare something that lists must-see sights, local foods, and what times are the busy times. Make sure they don't skimp on the details.

Attire unique to that country! Just a wardrobe change changes your entire perspective!

My retainers all hated to do it.[sr]But it really is amusing.

...Look at that smile. It's like saying, “I can get anything I want.” A royal ego like that reminds me of Gil... I mean, a different king that we know.
[k]

＠Mash
But when King Iskandar says it, I think I understand why his retainers would give in.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
So, this is the king who thought to slice through the Gordian Knot. Only Senpai could summon a Servant like this!
[k]

？1：That's not true!
？2：Maybe that's true!

Well, um...yeah. I guess it wouldn't kill us to have a, uh, couple people around with one or two screws loose.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
On that same note, maybe it wouldn't be so strange to have a king who mixes up tourism with conquest.
