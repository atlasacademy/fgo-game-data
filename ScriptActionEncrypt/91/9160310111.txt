＠Kiyohime
They must have taken a liking to this place.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
But I'm afraid they'll just have to move to the[sr]Enma-tei, whether they like it or not.
[k]

？2：This place reminds me of Mecha Eli-chan...

Oh my! Talking about another woman[sr]when you're here with me!?

＠Kiyohime
Well I never!

？！

＠Kiyohime
At any rate, my nose is telling[sr]me we should keep heading up.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Kiyohime
Unfortunately, there's a limit to what my Stalking Skill can track when I'm not using them on you...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Kiyohime
But, hehehe, the good news is, I don't[sr]need them to know where she's hiding.
[k]

？1：Yeah, I'm pretty sure she's in her room again...

＠Kiyohime
Agreed. Now come on, let's head straight[sr]up to the top of this castle.
[k]

？2：Haha, maybe the kotatsu in her room here leads to yet another alternate world.

[charaFace A 0]

＠Kiyohime
So a world inside a world, like a set of Matryoshka dolls? That does sound like an interesting idea.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

？！

Hehehe. All that aside, we haven't had[sr]many chances to be alone lately, Master.
