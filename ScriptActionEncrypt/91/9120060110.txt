When I reflect back, the question I asked just sort of slipped out...it was like a mistake.
[k]

＠
But the king smiled like his usual self to avoid answering... In a way, I thought that was the most sincere of answers.

Ah, nice. I never thought I would see this land with my own eyes again.

＠David
Well, technically lots of things are different from my time, but the basics are there.
[k]

＠David
Wonderful scenery.[sr]Fertile land worth tilling.
[k]

＠David
And I am standing on said land.[sr]This must be divine providence.

＠David
That once again...no. If it's completely the same, a terrible war will follow. Better to say “anew,” I think.
[k]

＠David
That a temple will be built here anew...one that is sure to have great influence over the world.

In my later years, I was beset by war. Constructing a temple had become a distant dream of mine.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠David
But it turns out I didn't need to mourn over such thing! All right! I'm getting pumped up!
[k]

＠David
After all, I'm incorrigible! I would do it multiple times should I have the opportunity!
[k]

＠David
I may not have resurrected, and I may be just one of many Heroic Spirits. However, I am still me. I am David, a servant of God.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠David
In that case, I think it only be natural for me to build a temple. However... I am in quite a bind.
[k]

＠David
I certainly have motive and opportunity,[sr]but I lack one thing.

[charaFace A 3]

Do you know what that is, [%1]?[sr]Oh, the Doctor can also answer.

＠David
People might think of giants as their own species,[sr]but that's not necessarily the case.
[k]

＠David
Phantasmal giants, as opposed to the actual species themselves, are first and foremost a representation of savagery. A power to be feared.
[k]

＠David
They are in more or less human form, yet not human.[sr]They are like gods, but not.
[k]

＠David
Oh, the term “god” I use here refers to deities of polytheism, not to the great and divine being I serve.
[k]

＠David
A being that is not human, but is human.[sr]And furthermore, very powerful.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

A being that is savage. A being that defies. For example[line 2]Oh, look over there. Yes, that's about right. Something like that.
