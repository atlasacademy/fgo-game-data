＠Dragon
Welcome, and how are you today?[sr]This is my magical workshop, Vortak's Dragonbones.

＠Dragon
An underground labyrinth was slated to undergo construction to lure some unlucky humans in so I can slaughter them and take their money but...
[k]

＠Dragon
...We're actually still a month away from our grand opening, but your timing couldn't be more perfect: I was just looking for some helpers.
[k]

＠Dragon
Therefore, as much as I want to let you go, I guess I can't really do that. Especially now you found out about my grand plan.
[k]

＠Dragon
Get roasted by my breath and succumb to your fate. I'd like you well-done and working a 60-hour week as my bone-cushion.

If King Gilgamesh is invovled, either we get something really scary or really weird!

＠Gilgamesh
Hahahaha, your praise is music to my ears, Mash![sr]But even I am at a loss for words!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I came searching for a dragon so I may test my Master's worth, but to think I would find such an idiot here!
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Gilgamesh
[%1], accept this as your fate.[sr]Minds that think alike attracts each other.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Gilgamesh
It seems your lot in life is to have idiots as your worthy opponents.
[k]

？1：I don't think that statement applies to me...

？2：I know. I'm like a weirdo magnet.

I hate to interrupt when you're having fun. Despite that dragon's behavior, that thing there is the real deal!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It has more magical energy than an A-rank Servant![sr]It might be even more powerful than Fafnir!
