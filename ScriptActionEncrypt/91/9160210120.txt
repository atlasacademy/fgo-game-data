Of course not! I'm an oni to my core.[sr]Do you think I'd fight a war I couldn't win?

＠Shuten-Douji
You're still as strong as I remember, though...[sr]If I let my guard down you'll split me right into two...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
That makes me happy.[sr]You're hitting me with your real strength.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Shuten-Douji
But... This isn't enough for me.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Let's stop fighting like little kids. I want you to come at me in a way that's more...grown-up.

Your appearance has changed, but your heart hasn't. You're still the little kid you used to be.

[charaFace C 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
You're holding back. Is it because you're that afraid to hit a woman?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I don't mind. Be fiercer. More violent.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

If you want more of a fight, let's bring out the bears!
