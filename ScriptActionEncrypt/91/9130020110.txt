How no one reacts to my face. Until now, I had to be careful merely walking around.

Oh. I see, it's about your beauty mark, Diarmuid?

[charaFace D 4]
＠Diarmuid
Yes, it's more like a curse than a mark of love. Nothing good ever came out of this beauty mark.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
...Well, even though I did not have any regret about the love I felt because of it.

＠Diarmuid
Apologies, we've strayed away from the subject. Master, what I want to talk about are my Noble Phantasms.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
Currently, I'm using two Noble Phantasms...[sr]“Gáe Dearg” and “Gáe Buidhe”[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Diarmuid
But perhaps due to using two Noble Phantasms, neither one demonstrates its true potential.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
In other words, their power is sealed.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Diarmuid
If I can release their power somehow,[sr]I think I could be a bigger help[line 2]

I'm painfully aware of the feelings of not being able to fully utilize your Noble Phantasm.

Why don't we have the Doctor investigate and see if there are any clues.

It was such a long time ago when Diarmuid was alive... We may not be able to trace it completely...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Either way, there is a chance that you actually sealed the Noble Phantasms yourself.

What do you mean?

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
It could be a malfunction during summoning, or the Servant is subconsciously restraining himself[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
I'm not really sure. But if you want to unleash his Noble Phantasm, why don't you just dive into his heart. It's risky though.
