＠Wu Zetian
Naturally I would recognize my own handwriting, so I employed someone else to write it for me, and even asked that Egyptian queen to help out as a villain.

Then, once all of those preparations were complete,[sr]I had that doctor there prepare both a potion to erase my memories and an antidote, and downed the former...

She does seem like she'd be enamored with the idea of a king training to be a better king.

＠Wu Zetian
You should be honored by the opportunity to join me on this adventure. I certainly will not be apologizing for dragging you along!

？1：No problem at all.

[charaFace B 1]

＠Wu Zetian
I see, I see. Well, there is no denying that this slight improvement has made me a completely perfect empress in every way.

＠Wu Zetian
...now that it is just the two of us, there is something[sr]I would like to ask you, Xuanzang Sanzang.

＠Sanzang

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_7 0.3]

＠Wu Zetian
...What did you think of my Tang[sr]dynasty while you were alive?

[bgm BGM_EVENT_11 0.5]

＠Wu Zetian
I know it was officially Gaozong's dynasty,[sr]but that is merely a technicality.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Even if you were solely focused on the sutras you brought back from the west, surely you must have heard something in the way of rumors.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Sanzang
...Hmm.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I really didn't hear much more than rumors, but I think I heard you did some terrible things to people.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Sanzang
So as a servant of the Buddha, let me be clear.
[k]

＠Sanzang
One should never be cruel or unkind to others![sr]For everything you do to them will be visited upon you!

[charaFace D 4]

＠Sanzang
Honestly...I'm not one to talk, since I'm still in training and make a ton of mistakes myself...
[k]

＠Sanzang
I can't be sure that what I do isn't making trouble for others, or isn't what others would consider to be bad.[sr]I still have so much training left to do...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Wu Zetian
...I believed that what I did was right. I believed it was the only way to create a proper, just nation.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
That is why I did it. That much is absolutely true.[sr]...I am even willing to swear to the Buddha.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Sanzang
Okay. In that case...I don't think[sr]I need to say anything more.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Sanzang
Because...I can't give you the[sr]answer you really want me to.

[k]

＠Sanzang
...I think that's really amazing.

We're all just lost children doing our best to find our way forward. As long as you keep up your training like that,[sr]I think you'll be just fine!
