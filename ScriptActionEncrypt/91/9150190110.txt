Oh! Speaking of which, I haven't introduced myself.[sr]I am Lord El-Melloi II.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
I am a mere human, who became the Spirit Origin of a[sr]famous strategist from the Three Kingdom Period in China.
[k]

？1：Lord?

[charaFace D 5]
＠El-Melloi
What, don't you know?[sr]What kind of manuals did Animusphere make...
[k]

？2：The Second?

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Right. I was originally a third-rate noble from the countryside. For certain reasons, I took after my mentor and inherited his name.

Excuse me, Lord El-Melloi II. When you say Lord,[sr]do you mean the "Lord" of the Mage's Association?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Yes. I represent one of the twelve noble families that[sr]operate the Clock Tower, the center of the Mage's Association. The lowest-ranked, though.

Same as [%1], I'm from the 21st[sr]century. Before I knew it, I became a Pseudo-Servant.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
A Pseudo-Servant...like me. Are you someone that was empowered by Heroic Spirits?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
...The result was the same but the idea's different.[sr]There's nobody identical to you in this time.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Originally, it's impossible to form a Demi-Servant.[sr]Just the same as it's impossible for Dhampir to be born among vampires.

As I'd expect of a Clock Tower mage, you probably understand the logic behind the impossible.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's right. Mash is an extremely unique example of[sr]success. It'd be hard to recreate an accident.

＠Mash
W-Well, you cannot deny that creating Demi-Servants was an inhumane experiment.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Your feeling of disgust is justified, Lord El-Melloi.[sr]Even more so if it comes from justice and morals.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
That aside, please continue your explanation.[sr]What are Pseudo-Servants?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Ah, yes.[sr]I shall answer that question.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
A Pseudo-Servant is someone possessed by a Heroic Spirit. Those Heroic Spirits who can't become a Servant...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Perhaps they are higher beings like Divine Spirits, or their Spirit Origins can't be created by Chaldea.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
In order to summon them as Servants, human vessels are sometimes used.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠El-Melloi
That is what a Pseudo-Servant is. Using a human body[sr]as catalyst to forcefully summon a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Oh-uh, [%1] looks confused.[sr]Obviously since it's a particularly unique case, right?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
In short, it's someone being possessed by a ghost.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Then the psyche of the possessed is overwritten by the Heroic Spirit...

I'm the opposite. I took only the role of Zhuge Liang,[sr]because western logic doesn't match eastern logic.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
But with the greater good of protecting humanity in mind, we share a common goal.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
That's why after a discussion with the Strategist on who should control the body, I ended up staying because of my knowledge of modern eras.

＠Dr. Roman
I see. That's very much Zhuge Liang.[sr]Just like what he did at the end of his life.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The important thing was for someone to execute his strategies, without participating on it...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In other words, he found the one capable of his strategies, so he decided not to appear.

By becoming one with the Heroic Spirits, I temporarily became a Servant.
