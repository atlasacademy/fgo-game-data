...The man she loved was withered, old,[sr]and very near the end of his life.
[k]

＠
He never demanded anything of her. His only request[sr]was that she be with him when he passed.
[k]

＠
She had learned song and dance to curry favor with men. But the old man smiled and said she was free to sing and dance to her heart's content...not to please anyone save herself.
[k]

＠
It was a quiet, gentle love.
[k]


＠
But, it didn't last.[sr]By the end, it was trampled beyond recognition.
[k]

＠
She doesn't regret what happened.[sr]But...
[k]

...she still sometimes dreams[sr]about what might have been.

＠Shakespeare
Oho, I'm delighted you know my[sr]Noble Phantasm's true purpose!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Shakespeare
Indeed, my Noble Phantasm recreates the past, exposes one's hidden sins, and metes out justice for them.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Every hero or monster has a point in their past when they were powerless, whether that past is mythical, legendary, or historical.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
My Noble Phantasm zeroes in on that point[sr]and uses it to break their spirit.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Shakespeare
...Hmm.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

But, I suppose it could also be[sr]used to merely recreate the past.

Were I to make a different choice in that recreated past, would it continue to unfold accordingly?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Semiramis
...I understand that what is done is done.[sr]One cannot change reality.

I suppose I could ad-lib something based on your reactions, but the future would become something of my own creation more than anything else, really.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Shakespeare
And surely that is not what you seek.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
In which case, our only option is to trust[sr]your memories of the person in question.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
That is to say, the actions they[sr]would take in response to yours...
