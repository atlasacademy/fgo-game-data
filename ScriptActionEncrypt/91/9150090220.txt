＠Da Vinci
The BBEG in particular. I can tell it's not a Servant,[sr]but it's still got a lot of magical energy.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It must have absorbed the Holy Grail fragment[sr]to get its magical energy levels up THIS high.

You're right, Da Vinci! I can see those exceptional magical energy readings from here, too!

＠Mash
It must possess a small Holy Grail,[sr]or a fragment of a larger one.

Gian Giacomo Caprotti. While she lived, Da Vinci took him under her wing when he was still a young boy.

He became Da Vinci's apprentice in Milan in 1490,[sr]where they grew as close as family.

Now I see. Since he died in 1524, this minute Singularity must have occurred when the small Holy Grail turned him into a ghost.

It would seem you were right on the mark, Ms. Da Vinci.

The Salaì I knew already had a fragment, so I figured he must have been the one affecting Master's dreams.

＠Da Vinci
I had a hunch, really,[sr]and it turned out to be dead-on.

You're the only person I ever knew who[sr]would think to pester me like this, Salaì.

＠Da Vinci
Still...[sr]Why is it a ghost this time around too?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Ah, well. I guess you never did get to a point[sr]where you'd be enshrined in the Throne.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Besides, if you were, I'm pretty sure all your bad habits would put you preeetty firmly on the Anti-Hero end of things anyway.
[k]

？1：Was he really THAT bad?
？2：He was just a kid, right?
？！


[charaFace A 1]
＠Da Vinci
He was a beautiful kid. Adorable, even!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Oh, I loved his curly hair. He may not have quite been at my level, but he was still as lovely as an angel.

Buuut, he was a freakin' brat, too. He was easily[sr]four times as mischievous as the average person.

[charaFace A 4]

He used to sell my shoes just to buy[sr]candy...steal my silver brushes...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Hell, he'd steal anything that wasn't nailed down, really... Broke my pots while we ate...
