Theseus did help my sister, Pasiphaë,[sr]wrap up one of her loose moral ends.

After he escaped from the labyrinth, I heard he took her daughter, my niece, Princess Ariadne...

...who was, I would add, the spitting image of her mother, as his bride.
[k]

＠Circe
And yet, for some reason, I haven't heard anything more about Ariadne after that happened. Not a peep.

＠Circe
Instead, all I've heard is how the king of Athens recently welcomed a new queen to his palace.
