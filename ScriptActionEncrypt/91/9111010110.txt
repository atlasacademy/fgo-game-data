＠Dr. Roman
Hey there, [%1].[sr]Sorry to bother you on your day off.
[k]


＠Dr. Roman
It's not really an urgent matter, but we've discovered that Sheba is trying to process a very heavy load at the moment.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
One of the areas of observation[sr]is making Sheba oddly sluggish.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Dr. Roman
It's not exactly surprising, as Sheba is getting worn out in a number of places, but the issue is actually WHERE the problem is, specifically.
[k]


＠Dr. Roman
And we can't say for sure that it wouldn't affect our Rayshifting operations to the other seven Singularities.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So what we should do here is form[sr]a team of our best Servants...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...and dispose of this bug that has[sr]been causing strain on the observation.
[k]

？1：What do you mean “bug”? That seems pretty vague.

？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠Dr. Roman
Hahaha! Look at you, pointing[sr]things out and questioning them!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Dr. Roman
Allow me to rephrase. We've detected a hostile signal[sr]we believe manifested from a residual Spirit Origin.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Basically we found an army of Shadow Servants[sr]and want you to get rid of them.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Dr. Roman
It's a rather...large army.[sr]So far we count about two thousand.
[k]

？1：Two thousand!?
？2：That's a lot!!!

？！

[charaFace B 8]

＠Dr. Roman
You'd think that.[sr]But the number is a little bit deceptive.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They are weak. Exceptionally weak.[sr]Even I could defeat one of them.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Dr. Roman
Of course, I'd need a rocket launcher[sr]fortified by magecraft to do it!
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Dr. Roman
Anyway...these weak Servants are piling up[sr]like someone's getting rid of them wholesale.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And that's putting a bit of strain on Sheba, since it observes the density of Spirit Origins as well as number.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even though the Servants are quite weak individually,[sr]the sheer number of them can cause problems.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And that can lead to observational[sr]errors in critical Singularities.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Dr. Roman
So I'd like you to head there and[sr]eliminate these Shadow Servants.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'll leave choosing the team to you. Actually, all you have to do is to Rayshift to the location and summon your Servants.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Servants should be able to handle these enemies without much direction from you, really.
[k]

？1：Roger that.
？2：So where're we going?

？！

＠Dr. Roman
You'll be Rayshifting somewhere[sr]you're quite familiar with, actually.
[k]




＠Dr. Roman
It's Singularity X. I want you to go back[sr]to the Flame Contaminated City, Fuyuki.
[k]

＠???
You there, [&mister:miss]. Yeah, you, Master...the one changing into a Mystic Code and getting all pumped up.
[k]

＠???
I heard everything. You're gonna go and get rid[sr]of the bug that popped up in Fuyuki, right?
[k]

＠???
Hahaha. I'll let you in on a secret: that was my bad. So I wouldn't mind lending you a hand to straighten this little mess out.
[k]

？1：And you are...?
？2：(Did we have a Servant like him...?)

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Hey! What're you lookin' at me like a freakin'[sr]dumbass for? It's me! Me! MEEE!!!
[k]


＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Oh, that's just great. All that hard work[sr]finally melted your damn brain, huh?
[k]


＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Can't remember names and faces anymore? Means you're losin' your marbles. Better rethink your whole way of living your weird damn life!
[k]


＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Startin' to show signs you're getting past your limits, so you better cut back on your workload or start getting your affairs in order before it's too late!
[k]

？1：I'm not THAT tired.
？2：You're that Avenger...

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Yup. I'm the Servant who contracted with you without you knowing or wanting me to. I'm the third-rate Servant whose origins are...uh...vague.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Normally I just kinda peek into the outside world from Chaldea, but I hadda call you this time 'cause it's got something to do with me.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
You're going to Fuyuki, right?[sr]I'm coming with. You can count on me. Heh.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
See, this'll be my turn to SHINE![sr]Why? Cuz these enemies are all WEAK AS SHIT!
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Heh heh. As one weak-ass Servant, this'll be[sr]my one and only chance to up my kill count.
[k]


＠Aŋra Mainiiu
So, hey, hold off on calling all the other Servants.[sr]You know, the ones who aren't weak.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
They get PLENTY of opportunities to look good.[sr]This is MY time to shine!
[k]


＠Aŋra Mainiiu
So let's DO this! Just you and me![sr]Let's go fix the Doctor's mess for him!
[k]

？1：I...would prefer not to? (Taking Mash...)


[charaFace A 2]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Oh hey, thanks for the vote of confidence, dick![sr]I'm not gonna let this go! I'm the man for the job here!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Also, probably not a great idea[sr]to bring Ms. Demi-Servant along.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
That little biddy can only fight stuff[sr]that's as strong as or stronger than her.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
And even if there's gonna come a time for her to lay the smackdown on something weaker than her, this probably isn't really the time for that.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Aaand I think that's a nice, cryptic note to leave[sr]off on, so I'mma hog all these enemies to myself.
[k]

？2：What could possibly go wrong?

[charaFace A 1]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Right, right!? The ones who're quick on the[sr]uptake always have an advantage, Master!
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
'Course it's not really a good thing to be so damn gullible, either. But let's just say that's gonna be a lesson dearly bought for you!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Anyways, let's get to Fuyuki. You know how it goes: travels make for trials, and you never really gain anything without painstaking effort!
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Don't worry. With me around, this'll all be over in a heartbeat! Won't even have to go searching around the flaming city!
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Those things are gonna SWARM all over me![sr]The moment we Rayshift there, it'll be freakin' pandemonium!
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
And, Master, it'd be great if you'd just sorta stand[sr]back and watch the carnage and look all grossed out.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_7 0.4]


？1：Eh...?

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Okay, let's DO this! No more hesitating![sr]Let's go straight to hell, Master!
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
I'm gonna show you a real, all-out fight!
