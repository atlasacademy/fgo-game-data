Are you even more reckless than me!? Don't you want to die!?

I-I can't help it! The stronger an enemy, the more I want to see the essence of its strength.

The stronger they are, the more I respect them, the more I want to cross swords with them!

It's only natural that I'd end up getting stronger! It's not my fault!

Cú Chulainn and you, [%1].[sr]The day will surely come when you can kill me.

Before you save the world,[sr]kill me, if only once.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Scáthach
That is my wish.[sr]To that abysmal probability, I devote this body.

＠Cú Chulainn
Yeah, yeah, I got it. We're stuck together 'till we both die... No, 'till we both kill each other.

＠Cú Chulainn
There's still a long way to go. Going along with a woman's selfishness is also a requirement to be a top-tier Master, [%1].
