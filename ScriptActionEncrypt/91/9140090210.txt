Remember how we went to all sorts of places during our pirating years?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Anne
Oh yes. When we got to port, you would always go out exploring.
[k]

＠Mary
It was hard for you, Anne, because men would always follow you around even just walking down the street.

＠Dr. Roman
The Knights Templar were a group formed by clergymen to protect pilgrims traveling through the Holy Land.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
One of their missions was to guard the treasures of knights and believers on pilgrimages.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
As more pilgrims and crusaders started going to the Holy Land, the Templars gained more wealth to guard.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They ultimately functioned as a bank, including loaning money. They were even entrusted with an entire nation's fortune.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But the Kingdom of France, heavily in debt, captured and tortured many of them.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
France wanted to get rid of their debts and take the money.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even though they canceled out their debts, a majority of the fortune France sought disappeared into the shadows.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 3]
＠Dr. Roman
The Templars are even said to have possessed a Holy Grail, but everything's been shrouded in mystery.

I heard the story from an old man who said he was a descendant of one of the Templars.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Um, can we trust him?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mary
I'm not sure. He was drunk, and he kept switching between yelling and crying.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Mary
But the story itself seemed sensible.[sr]From what he said...
[k]

＠Mary
The Templars had heard from their spies that their lives were in danger.
[k]

＠Mary
So they loaded their treasure on a ship and hid it somewhere. Everyone involved in the transport was killed on the spot.
[k]

＠Mary
Their plan was to hide the treasure until the Templars could rebuild themselves.
[k]

＠Mary
The old man's ancestor left the Templars so he wouldn't be caught. Even the Templars didn't know where he hid.
[k]

＠Mary
But the Templars never recovered. His ancestors continued to pass down the word to wait for the Templars' reformation.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mary
After about four centuries, they stopped caring.[sr]He sold me the story for a drink...

That's right. It's getting to the treasure that's the fun part. There isn't much we could do with the treasure as we are now, anyway.

But it can boost our QP, and maybe we'll find something interesting! Let's go!
