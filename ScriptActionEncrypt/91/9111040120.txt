I can feel the evil presence growing stronger.[sr]It certainly doesn't bother me, but you[line 2]

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Gorgon
Tsk. You're fine? Disappointing. Do you have no consideration for how your whimpering and looks of terror would keep me entertained on this dull journey?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Gorgon
Don't you know?[sr]Human suffering is my greatest pleasure.
[k]

＠Gorgon
Seeing, hearing, and tasting human suffering[sr]are my favorite things to do...
[k]

＠Gorgon
That terror, oh it makes me drool in anticipation. There is no better seasoning for my meal.
[k]

？1：Is that because...you're an Avenger?
？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Gorgon
...What a silly thing to say.
[k]

＠Gorgon
That class was forced upon me when I was summoned as a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Gorgon
But...you're probably right.[sr]Your absurd question jogged my memory.
[k]

？1：...Memory of what?
？！

[charaFace A 2]

＠Gorgon
Rage!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Gorgon
Yes...I may truly be an Avenger. The desire for[sr]revenge does indeed burn within my Spirit Origin.
[k]

＠Gorgon
But...revenge against what?[sr]Whatever is it that I hate so much?
[k]

＠Gorgon
The unknown is what infuriates me, and it has led me to kill and devour all living things I encounter.
[k]

＠Gorgon
That, at least, I find fulfilling, all the[sr]more so if the victim is someone I loathe.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Gorgon
Heh...a monster who doesn't even[sr]know who deserves her vengeance...
[k]

＠Gorgon
Of all the Heroic Spirits you employ,[sr]I must be the most bizarre and horrible!
[k]

？1：That's not true...
？！

＠Gorgon
Tsk. I've said too much. Forget it.

Either way, the stench of evil is getting stronger here. Something is bound to happ[line 2]
