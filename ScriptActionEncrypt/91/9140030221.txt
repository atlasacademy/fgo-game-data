So that is the Drake Passage off to the south.[sr]I can see it's a complex maze of rough currents.

No wonder it was considered impossible to cross with sixteenth-century nautical engineering.

Well that's a waste. Just imagine if you'd made your way across it and arrived at Antarctica, old hag!

You could've been a triple crown pioneer, conquering the world, the Spanish Armada, and Antarctica! You were so close!

Huh, yeah, I guess that is kind of a waste.[sr]Triple crown's got a nice ring to it!

But oh well. It's all academic now, anyway.
[k]

＠Drake
Besides, I'm not like Magellan.[sr]I never had any interest in a southern super continent.

＠Drake
On a different note, Blackbeard, up for some hunting? Consider it your fare after stowing away on my ship.

You certainly are a slave driver, aren't you, old hag. Fine, how many do you want? Ten? A hundred?
[k]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 4]

＠Drake
One'll be plenty! Hell, just how big of an eater do you think I am, anyway? All I want's some raw meat. I haven't had any in a long time.

Shaddup! Of course I can cook! All you gotta[sr]do is skin it, gut it, and cook the meat!

Keep whining, and I'll cook you too![sr]And I won't bother putting you down first, either!

That ain't cooking![sr]That's just torture!

＠Drake
We got caught up in a hell of a storm after we crossed the Strait of Magellan. Took everything we had just to wash up here.
[k]

＠Drake
The fleet I put back together at San Julián got torn apart, until the only ship left was the Golden Hind.
[k]

＠Drake
Almost out of food, not a penny to our names...not that it'd help since, y'know, no markets nearby. So nothing but seal here for days just to survive.

I'm a carnivore myself, but there's no stinking way I'd ever eat seal to survive. I'd just turn tail and run back home.

[charaTalk B]

[charaFadein B 0.1 1]

＠Drake
Don't be daft. You know damn well we're not the kind of pirates who turn tail and run home just because we had a little run-in with death.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Drake
Me, I found it exciting. I'd never have had a[sr]chance to eat seal if I'd lived a normal life.
[k]

＠Drake
And my ship was still seaworthy, so it wasn't[sr]a complete loss, given my nautical skills.
[k]

＠Drake
Besides, if I'd turned back now,[sr]that idiot Thomas would've died for nothing.
[k]

＠Drake
So I decided to jump from the frying pan into[sr]the fire and make this place my crossroads.
[k]

＠Drake
As a result, I ended up staying on this island for a long time. Enough to lay plenty of traps for whoever found it next.

[charaTalk B]

[charaFadein B 0.1 1]

＠Drake
Sure. I hid it in a cave not too far from here.[sr]What do you say we go get it after we finish this seal?
[k]

＠Drake
You guys'll get your precious[sr]magical energy, and I'll...
[k]

＠Drake
...Well, for me, seal meat tastes like condemnation.[sr]Sure puts a strong wind in my sails.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Drake
After all, Chaldea's got a bunch of real tough Servants!
[k]

＠Drake
So I've gotta shape up if I'm[sr]gonna beat the other Riders!
[k]

？1：True, the other Riders are pretty tough...

[charaFace B 5]

＠Drake
That they are. I wonder why so many kings end up as Riders? There's the King of Conquerors, the King of Kings, the King of Maids...
[k]

＠Drake
...Well, I don't know much about that last one, but the way things're going, it looks like it's only a matter of time until some real crazy king shows up.
[k]

＠Drake
So I've GOTTA light a fire under my ass[sr]if I'm gonna be of any help to you.
[k]

？2：Captain Drake'll always be leading the from the front.

[charaFace B 3]

Aww, really? I don't know what to say. I never did learn how to take a compliment... Damn, I think I'm blushing.

Storing magical energy in jewels is a pretty[sr]common practice in the magecraft world.

＠Drake
...You know, a lotta stuff[sr]went down on my voyage, but...
[k]

＠Drake
...if it really did help the people who came after me, then that actually makes me feel like something of a proud hero.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Drake
That my life wasn't just a bunch of idiotic hijinks.
[k]

＠Drake
People used to say I kept getting swept up[sr]in storms 'cause I never learned my lesson.
[k]

＠Drake
But thanks to that, I proved that I could look back on my miserable final moments and still smile.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Drake
[%1], you've already been[sr]thrown into a stormy sea headfirst.
[k]

＠Drake
You can't run from it, you can't move forward in it, and it won't let you go no matter how hard you cry.
[k]

＠Drake
The only thing you can do in times like that is hold your head high and smile. It might not always be easy, but if there's one thing you gotta take away from this little adventure, that's it.
[k]

？1：So I just have to smile?
？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠Drake
That's right. Long as you're still smiling,[sr]everyone else'll be happy to help you.
[k]

＠Drake
After all, smiling when times are tough is the best thing you can do to win someone's trust. No hero's gonna turn their back on a winning horse like that.
[k]

＠Drake
Isn't that right, Tesla?[sr]I bet you've got a winning smile up your sleeve too.

I do indeed. Any true genius is always ready with a smile, whether they're in a tight spot or not.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
Though of course, a nihilistic smile would[sr]not suit you, young [%1].
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
No, the smile that best suits you is more akin to the strength of a quiet spring day...or perhaps the charming elegance of a pigeon in the park.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
Naturally, I quite like that sort[sr]of intelligent smile myself.

Me, I want to be surrounded by my own little harem, no matter what kind of battle we're fighting! My own smile's my greatest charm, after all!
