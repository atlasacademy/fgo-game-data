＠Mash
Whew![sr]We ended up going around the whole forest.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
But it paid off, bigtime.[sr]Not just from the battles, but what Robin did.
[k]

＠Mash
He's been protecting the town without them ever knowing, right?
[k]

？1：Yeah. Robin Hood is a true hero.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Robin Hood
Aww, don't say that.[sr]I'm not a hero even after death.
[k]

？2：Aww, you should've just told us.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Robin Hood
I'll admit I can be a bit of an oddball.[sr]But you've got me all wrong, [%1].
[k]

？！

＠Robin Hood
I don't even remember the people in town.[sr]I just protect it because it's a nice place.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Robin Hood
I'm not any different from the soldiers who attack[sr]the town. Just different tastes.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Um, what does that mean?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Robin Hood
You know, I didn't want to go around crushing[sr]kids' dreams. But I may as well say it.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Robin Hood
You guys talk about saving humanity, but that stuff's too big for me to really understand.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
I'm a Servant?[sr]It got to be some kind of mistake.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
I was just a murderer with a rebel streak.[sr]I didn't save anything.
[k]

？1：But you saved the villagers.

？2：There are people you saved.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Robin Hood
That's just how things ended up.[sr]I fought alone, and the village was safe for a year or two.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Robin Hood
Sure, I fought the lord's army,[sr]but that doesn't mean I wanted to save anyone.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Robin Hood
You get it? I'm just a thug and a coward.[sr]So be careful, Master.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
It's dangerous to let your guard down because of my[sr]good looks. I'm a coward who'll run if he has to.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Anyway, we're done hunting, so I'll be going.[sr]Might take a nap in the woods.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Call me if there's a fight.[sr]It's my job, so I'll do whatever crazy things I have to.

...He's gone.[sr]But Robin contradicted himself.
[k]

＠Mash
He said he protected the town because it was a nice place to be, but he sleeps in the forest.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I think he...I think he's keeping his[sr]distance from what's truly important to him.
[k]

？1：Some guys are like that, Mash.

？2：...It might be too important for him.

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
What does that mean...[sr]Hey, why are you smiling like that?
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
If you know the answer, please tell me![sr]Senpai, Senpaaaai!
