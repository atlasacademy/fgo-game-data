There is too much that he cannot remember.

When did my bow change into guns?[sr]...I can't remember.
[k]

＠
When did I change into this form?[sr]...I can't remember.
[k]

＠
My memories are hazy, my Spirit Origin is nebulous,[sr]and my soul is being shredded to the bone.
[k]

＠
But even so...there's something I just can't let go of.
[k]

＠
Of course, the real problem...
[k]

＠
...is that I can't even tell[sr]what that something is anymore.

The situation looks pretty grim.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I think we're in Japan sometime in the 2000s,[sr]but as you can see, there's been a huge disaster.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
And we can't seem to get in touch with Chaldea either.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Looks like our only choice is to make our way through this burning city.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I'm sure you're not thrilled about being stuck with me, but I'm sure we'll find a Servant who's a better fit for this sooner or later.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
In the meantime, I'll start[sr]by cleaning up the riffraff.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Don't fall behind. Make sure you keep up.
[k]

？1：W-will do!
？！
