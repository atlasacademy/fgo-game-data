How did those monsters get here?
[k]

＠Mash
It makes no sense to me either. However...[sr]I do feel that you're the key, Jeanne.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Me?[sr]True, this France is my homeland.
[k]

＠Jeanne
I will certainly not allow anyone to ravage it[line 2][sr]...Huh?
[k]

？1：What is it?

？2：Notice something?

？！

Jeanne?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
Yes, that could be it...
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jeanne
We must hurry to the throne![sr]Most likely, this will solve this mystery!

Stay calm, Mash.[sr]That is only a monster that looks like a demon.

My name is Mephistopheles![sr]I am a Servant granted the class of Caster!

Oh, so you know who I am?[sr]Is it possible that we have been allies?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Mephistopheles
In that case don't worry![sr]I have been summoned by someone else.
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
That is to say, I can kill you all[sr]without any problem!

Mephistopheles...is your name, right?[sr]I have one question for you.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Mephistopheles
Do you?[sr]Then out with it.
[k]

＠Jeanne
What is it with this charade?
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
That, you see[line 2]
[k]

＠Jeanne
Are you trying to tell me that[sr]everything I did was pointless?
[k]

＠Jeanne
Or possibly, since France does not exist now[line 2]
[k]

＠Jeanne
Are you testing me to see if I will[sr]raise my banner and rally the people?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Mephistopheles
My, my! That is an excellent answer![sr]I applaud you! A great round of applause, everyone!

＠Mephistopheles
So, what of it?[sr]How does that make you feel?
[k]

＠Jeanne
To be honest, It certainly makes me feel awful.[sr]But in the end, this is all a fantasy.
[k]

＠Jeanne
I have nothing to fear from a fantasy.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Mephistopheles
However, what about a logical fantasy?
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Mephistopheles
This town is an actualization of the assumption,[sr]"what if you never existed."
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
Jeanne d'Arc![sr]O Holy Maiden of Salvation!
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
You alone do not make the world go round![sr]Nay. Whether you act or not...the people are happy!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
...[sr]...
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
Neither a king nor a hero, and to borrow your own words, neither a saint as well[line 2]
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
How dare you worry about the world's transformation!?
[k]

？1：What's wrong with it?

？！

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaFace A 6]
[charaFadein A 0.1 2]
＠Mash
...!
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Mephistopheles
Who asked you?[sr]My question was meant for Jeanne d'Arc[line 2]
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]
[charaFace D 4]
[charaFadein D 0.1 2]
＠Jeanne
It's exactly as you say.[sr]...I may have been meaningless.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Mephistopheles
Heheheh.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
[line 2]However, does one only act if there is meaning?
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Mephistopheles
...What did you say?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
The fate of mankind is bright, vibrant, yet cruel.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Just as life can be full of meaning, death can also have equally as much significance.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
People act when it's "meaningful."[sr]People don't act when it's "meaningless."
[k]

＠Jeanne
Acting or staying immobile while knowing the future.[sr]To me, that is not what humans are.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jeanne
[line 2]Let me put it clearly!
[k]

＠Jeanne
I'm not looking at the future.[sr]I merely head down the path I have chosen for myself.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Let me be even more explicit.[sr]"Tomorrow is another day"[line 2]That's all there is to it.
[k]

＠Jeanne
That is my answer.[sr]Tell that to whoever hired you.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Mephistopheles
...I see. I see.[sr]I see. I see!
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
So, your heart will not break.[sr]In that case! I will have to physically break you.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Mephistopheles
...No. Wait a moment.[sr]I haven't been able to make really witty comments.
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
Could it be that I am the one that broke?[sr]Could it be? ...Yes, it could be!
[k]

[se ad23]
[wait se ad23]
＠Jeanne
Take this world as it is.[sr]Even if you have no hope, and all you have is despair.
[k]

＠Jeanne
...So people, without halting, can keep their chins up and move forward.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jeanne
Regardless of brambles, regardless of pitfalls.[sr]I will[line 2]choose a path where I can march forward!!
