＠Martha
A normal...[sr]Yes, the kind of normal girl you'd find in any town.
[k]

＠Martha
I lived happily with my little sister and brother, even though we quarreled from time to time.
[k]

＠Martha
I was born in Bethany, and raised in the same town.
[k]

＠Martha
I thought that I'd live my life the same as everyone else.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Martha
...No. Actually, how shall I put it?[sr]Perhaps I never even thought about the future.
[k]

＠Martha
Because I was always busy. What should we have for[sr]dinner tonight? What would tomorrow's weather be[line 2]
[k]

＠Martha
I was always running around, even when "He" was there.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Martha
While my sister listened to "His" words, all I did was worry about making guests feel welcomed.

＠Mash
Martha, you were a girl who put her family first.[sr]I think that's admirable.
[k]

？1：You're naturally friendly.

？2：I think it's nice.

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Martha
I wonder about that.[sr]Aren't you disappointed?
[k]

＠Martha
Saints whom people love always[sr]seem to shine...Yes, like Jeanne d'Arc.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Both Jeanne and you seem like shining saints to me.
[k]

＠Mash
In loving people, you became their hope.[sr]That's the sort of women you are.
[k]

＠Mash
That's why I think you equally deserve to be called saints.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Martha
...Thank you, Mash Kyrielight.

[charaFace A 13]

Don't mention it[line 2]

Oh, sorry to interrupt, but I'm detecting multiple magical signatures in the sea ahead.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Just as Martha feared, there's some sort of distortion on the Marseille coast as it's being repaired.

Doctor, do we need to dive under the sea?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Martha
I doubt it. If push comes to shove,[sr]my Tarasque will guide the "swarm" to the shore.

Swarm?

Yes. That's a swarm, without a doubt.[sr]My trait allows me to accurately detect that.
[k]

＠Martha
A swarm of an incomplete subspecies of dragon.[sr]Something that shouldn't be in this area of the 15th century.

...This is nothing.[sr]This coast was once part of the Tarasque's domain.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Martha
Born of Leviathan, created by God on the Fifth Day[line 2][sr]he is a fierce monster many a brave man tried to slay.

Now the Tarasque exists with me.[sr]The sad dragon who knows not of love.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Martha
Go now Tarasque, wielding a burning heat equal to the sun...
[k]

＠Martha
Grant momentary peace to these creatures made pitiful by the moment of their birth[line 2]
