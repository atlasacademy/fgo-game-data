Juuust kidding! Did you really think[sr]you could get rid of me that easily?

I can do anything in digital worlds,[sr]including cheating to give myself infinite lives.

...No, I guess I couldn't have solved it all on my own.[sr]Not to mention I ended up having some of my more embarrassing parts exposed.

I'll just hide in one of Chaldea's corners and live out the rest of my materialization as a Rogue Servant, doing what I can to help from the shadows...

[charaFace A 2]

Don't worry, I've got that covered![sr]I know plenty of other Servants who'd be willing to fight!

There's Medb, d'Eon, Paraíso, Hijikata...[sr]And I'm sure there'd be lots of others if I asked!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

Hehe. I'm sure I'll end up losing[sr]in the end, but that'll be fun, too.

Okay, let's go, Master.

I'm going to make you proud to have me as a Servant!
