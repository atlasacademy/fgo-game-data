I guess chimera's heart is just as fragile.[sr]It was only playing dead, huh?

No, it was a strong enough enemy...[sr]Master, are you hurt anywhere?

It was being concealed by spells.[sr]This is an abandoned workshop.

What do we do with the remains of the chimera and[sr]the boar? We can't just leave them here...

Yeah, how about turning them into a stew?[sr]The job's done, and I'm hungry!
[k]

？2：Is Chimera stew even safe?

？！

＠Cú Chulainn
Sure you can eat it. You can eat anything, as long as[sr]it's muscle. Just make sure it's cooked and you're set.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Cú Chulainn
Well, if it's rotten and gives me the runs after it's sterilized, I'll deal with it then.

Right, tonight we dine in style! I'll get this[sr]cooked up and share it with you Chaldea guys!
