Hey, what the heck? Gathering all these spirits in one place, are you planning on forming an army or something?

That's not a bad idea. I wouldn't have to keep my air of being aloof and reckless.

Is that so? Many months and years have passed while I presided over the gates of this demonic land. I've seen many lives and deaths here.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Scáthach
I thought... I might as well rot.
[k]

＠Scáthach
But this body never decayed. My soul was forever frozen, unchanged.

＠Scáthach
Yet, my soul was always too...decent...to allow me to plunge into the morass of true evil.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Scáthach
My desires faded, and my senses told only of silence and eternity.

Humanity was incinerated. And with its absence, I gained the chance to end my eternity of monotony...

And though it is temporary, I have “life” as a Servant.[sr]So, I find myself wanting to test it.

No matter how much I try to hold back, I cannot contain it.
