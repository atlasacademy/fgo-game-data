...It was when she revealed the goal[sr]of this voyage back at San Julián.

＠Thomas Doughty
At first, she went around recruiting investors, saying we were gonna get rich by attacking Spanish treasure ships. Then we put together a fleet and set out from Plymouth.

What she didn't say was that her REAL plan was to sail around the world. ...She even kept it a secret from me, her best friend.
