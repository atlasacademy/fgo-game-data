And what follows naturally from that battle? Blood shed in pain. And that's exactly what she needed.

I'd say that's because Medb is the Queen of Connacht first and a Rider second.

＠Fergus
I've also heard that fairy[sr]blood runs through her veins.

No doubt that's because she needed fairy queen power[sr]to rule Connacht and keep it safe from its enemies.
