Master?[sr]Did you happen to witness my transformation?

I apologize for messing up the plan.[sr]Very sorry.

Recently, a giant centipede that lives in Mt. Mikami[sr]have been wrecking havoc on the neighboring village.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
It would have been ignored had it only hunted down wild beasts, but now it has begun to prey on livestock and even on my own kind.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
That giant centipede is nothing but a headache to us.[sr]I ask of you: Would you slay this wicked beast?

You may call it a giant, but a centipede is still just a bug. Squashing it should be easy. I'll head over to Mt. Mikami and slay that thing in no time flat.

If one had a cool head, yes, that would have been the logical move. But for some reason, I was riled up.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
Hm. It must have been because the battle against the dragon deity was so intense. I'd pretty much put all of this at her feet, really!
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
Either way, I had also forgotten that[sr]I only had three arrows in my possession.

We couldn't replicate a giant centipede, but I wanted to create something that would frighten someone to their core with just a single glance.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
And, well, those three fit the bill. So, I asked them to consent to being put in the bizarre position of forming a centipede like this.

But if Lord Tawara Touta is requesting this,[sr]we cannot refuse.

I am a little conflicted about playing a demonic role...but I shall become a centipede for Master!
