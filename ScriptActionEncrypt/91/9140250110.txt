It's just that every time I see it,[sr]I'm reminded of the huge opportunity I missed.
[k]

＠Columbus
I never even realized it until someone[sr]else told me what I'd passed up...
[k]

？1：But aren't you the one who made cacao popular?
？！

[charaFace B 4]

＠Columbus
Exactly.
[k]

＠Columbus
Sure, I was the one who first brought cacao beans back from the New World, but I didn't really have any idea what they might be for.
[k]

＠Columbus
They didn't catch on as sweets until years later.[sr]Ugh, even today it kills me to think about it.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Columbus
'Course that was all a long time ago, but still...
[k]

＠Columbus
...I smell an opportunity to make big[sr]cacao money here in Chaldea, too...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Columbus
But I digress. I'm here 'cause I got[sr]a little favor to ask you, Master.
[k]

？1：You don't say... (Suspicious stare)

？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠Columbus
C'mon, don't give me that look!
[k]

＠Columbus
I don't know what shenanigans any other versions of me might've gotten up to, but I'm your faithful Servant.
[k]

[charaFace B 11]

＠Columbus
...So long as you assign me the[sr]right kinds of work, that is.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Columbus
I always get a thrill whenever I help[sr]you open the door to the treasury.
[k]

？1：I had a feeling that might be the case.

[charaFace B 10]

Anyway, getting back on track...here's what I had in mind.
[k]

＠Columbus
There's a whole boatload of Servants here in Chaldea besides me, right?
[k]

＠Columbus
Some of them have invited me to join their clubs,[sr]and I've been meaning to turn them all down.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Columbus
But for some strange reason, people keep[sr]taking what I say and do the wrong way.

＠Columbus
I'm not trying to offend anyone by turning them down, but I might be coming off harsher than I mean to...
[k]

＠Columbus
...and ruffling the rest of[sr]Chaldea's feathers as a result.
[k]

＠Columbus
Since you're our Master, I'm hoping you[sr]can help me put a stop to all of that.
[k]

？1：Okay...but what exactly did you have in mind?
？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠Columbus
Don't worry, it's easy.
[k]

＠Columbus
All you have to do is be there with me, and throw[sr]me a lifeline if things start going off the rails.
[k]

＠Columbus
You're a special [&guy:gal] to all us Servants, after all.
[k]

＠Columbus
Just having you there for these sorts of conversations will make a world of difference.
[k]

＠Columbus
If you've got time to spare, Mash, it'd be great to have you around too. You know pretty much every Servant here, don't you?

＠Mash
Well, sure, I don't mind coming along.
[k]

＠Mash
But, I'm curious: Why are you turning these invitations down in the first place?
[k]


＠Mash
From what I know about these clubs, they just appear to be a way for their members to get to know each other better.
[k]


＠Mash
Is turning down an invitation[sr]to one really such a big deal?
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[k]

＠Columbus
It's really just a me thing.[sr]I just figure it's better to be true to myself.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Columbus
...Hey, let me ask you two something:[sr]What word would you say best defines who I am?

Is it just the two of you in this club?[sr]What about that Brit...uh, Francis Drake, I think?

No, no, nothing like that. I don't know how she feels about international relations, but I couldn't care less.

＠Columbus
Besides, she just handed España's asses to them 'cause England paid her good money for it. It's not as though she sold her soul to queen and country or anything.
[k]

＠Columbus
Still...haha, I bet it'd be a lot of fun[sr]to join her in drinking the night away.

[charaFace C 0]

＠Anne
Maybe some kind of mock tavern, where pirates can swap tales of their voyages over mugs of beer?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Anne
It wouldn't matter what the tales are about. They could be about foolish mistakes, daring exploits, reliving the good old days...
[k]



[charaFace D 0]

＠Mary
And of course, if any members have any leads on new treasure, they could choose to share them[line 2]or not[line 2]and compete with each other to see who could find it first.

[k]

＠Anne
He might be a super-perv, but I guess he's first a first-class pirate. He really is an ultra-perv though.
[k]

？1：(I guess once wasn't enough.)
？2：From super, to ultra...!
？！

[charaFace D 5]

＠Mary
Besides, Chaldea could easily end up summoning other pirates in the future, right?
[k]

＠Mary
If one of them was that coward, Calico Jack Rackham, or Captain Kidd, or that hottie Bartholomew...
[k]

＠Mary
...they might end up siding with Blackbeard,[sr]much as saying so kills me.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Anne
Yeah! So we need to grab as many capable sailors for our club while we can.
[k]

＠Anne
Having Captain Drake and Christopher Columbus in our club would absolutely give us the edge in both skill and popularity!
