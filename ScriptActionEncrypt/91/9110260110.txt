Thank you[line 2]

＠d'Eon
Sorry for making you tag along with me.[sr]But, thank you.

＠d'Eon
Something is going to happen here, in this era.[sr]I can't shake that feeling.
[k]

＠d'Eon
So that's why I insisted on this, and now here we[sr]are...in the Paris of a bygone age.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Honestly, I hope we find nothing, but in that case...hmm.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠d'Eon
It'll mean I've wasted your time. I apologize,[sr]you're probably tired from the constant fighting.

Don't worry about it.[sr]It seems like Senpai is feeling restless anyway.
[k]

？1：Yeah, I just can't fall asleep.

？2：I feel wide-awake.

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Maybe there's some kind of connection with what d'Eon's feeling.

That's right, Masters and Servants are connected through magical energy, so it's possible.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
One recorded example is the phenomenon of shared memories within dreams.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
I imagine there are other examples as well.[sr]It's quite intriguing.

＠d'Eon
Haha, either is fine.[sr]Sometimes I am a man, and sometimes woman.
[k]

＠d'Eon
You may refer to me however you wish.[sr]Hey [%1], what do I look like to you?
[k]

？1：A woman, I guess?

[charaFace D 0]
＠d'Eon
Hehe...[sr]So that's how I look.
[k]

？2：A man, I guess?

[charaFace D 0]
＠d'Eon
Hmm...[sr]So that's how I look.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠d'Eon
I'm the Knight of the White Lily, sworn to defend France's royal family. Gender means nothing to me.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Sometimes I'm a saber-wielding dragoon.[sr]Sometimes I'm an elegant lady in a dress.
[k]

＠d'Eon
If it's to defend the royal family, I won't hesitate to use a saber or a dress.
[k]

＠d'Eon
That remains as true now as it was when I was alive.[sr]Being a Heroic Spirit doesn't change that.

I committed a crime. I remember my manifestation[sr]in this world as Berserk Saber.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Not just at all of you... I even pointed my blade[sr]at "the one" who's the very symbol of the royal family.
[k]

＠d'Eon
I want to atone for that.[sr]Forgive me Master [%1].
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠d'Eon
Instead of fulfilling my duties as a Servant, I am now acting to fulfill my duties as a defender of the royal family.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Please forgive me, even if it's only for a night.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Please give me a chance.[sr]Master.
[k]

？1：Don't worry about it.

？2：Sure, I don't feel like sleeping anyway.

？！

[charaFace D 1]

...Thank you, Master.
