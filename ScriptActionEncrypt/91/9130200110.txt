I see. So the Holy City you saw was the avatar of my sacred lance.

It is true there was a possibility that it could cause that. As you can see, I am rather lacking in humanity.

Lacking in humanity, huh... Now that you mention it, it's true that you feel a lot closer to the King Arthur we ran into in Fuyuki.

＠Dr. Roman
So are you saying that if you're displeased with [%1], then you'll also become like the Lion King?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That you'll collect pure and noble humans, and use your sacred lance to imprison them?

Well, time heals all. She may have the same Spirit Origin as the Lion King, but the two of them are separate Heroic Spirits.

Given the chance, I think she'll open up to you in an instant.

Good night! Welcome to Merlin's dream world!
[k]

＠Merlin
What's this... REM sleep? That's not good! Did you go back to sleep after the alarm went off? Or are you taking a nap?
[k]

＠Merlin
At any rate, I would suggest you get some deeper sleep.[sr]I wouldn't be able to bug you until you do!
[k]

？1：No doubt... This is a nightmare!
？2：There he is, the root of all evil!

？！

[charaFace D 0]

＠Merlin
I see. You're asleep, but your judgment is still sound. This is why I hate REM sleep, where the brain's half awake.
[k]

＠Merlin
Well, I'm just kind of an observer here, but I'd still like you to welcome me.
[k]

＠Merlin
Why, you ask? Well, you're worried about Altria, aren't you?
[k]

＠Merlin
Well, that's where I come in, you see.[sr]Just leave it to me!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Merlin
Altria's always been rather stubborn. But when she has her sacred lance, she can become a handful. Heh.
[k]

＠Merlin
Geez, I wonder who would give anyone something so dangerous... I feel bad for that fool.

To be honest, I'd never expect Cath Pa...[sr]I mean Fou to be this close to you.

＠Merlin
With Fou here, I can't feed you lies woven into truth. I wanted to tease you a bit more and have some fun, but...
[k]

＠Merlin
Oh well, let's get down to business, then. You want to know what Altria is like when she's holding the sacred lance, right?
[k]

＠Merlin
I'll lend you a hand, then. Fortunately, it seems like a channel is about to open.
[k]

＠Merlin
To be honest, I can enter anyone's sleep.
[k]

＠Merlin
During REM sleep, like yourself right now, the owner of the dream can “notice” I'm there, so I don't want to enter that much.

Very good. Now your mind will leave your body and soul, and move to the world of a certain Heroic Spirit's mind.

A flaxen-haired, green-eyed beauty. A shining lance.[sr]An isolated king. This is the Heroic Spirit you will meet.

You can talk to them all you want there.[sr]Anyway, I'll be leaving now, so don't worry about me.

But I do understand. You are wondering about the true feelings of your contracted Servants...

You wish to touch the shining inner mysteries of my spirit, shrouded in Mystics...

It is only natural to wish so... It is inevitable.[sr]No, a forbidden act dictated by fate!

I am here because I sensed the presence of evil. My pure-hearted Master is about to fall in the trap of an evil incubus!

I chased after that presence the moment I felt it.[sr]Come, take my hand.

＠Fionn
This kind of evil... No, perhaps not evil... Actually rather beautiful... I mean, what is this place?

It feels quite similar to my homeland... But I have no memories of a city being built with this kind of construction technology...
