...I don't feel pain from being burned.[sr]...I don't feel grief from being cursed.
[k]

＠
The only thing I feel is immense, overwhelming heartbreak. It's not my body that's being consumed, but my soul.
[k]

＠
Since I don't seek salvation in ascension,[sr]the stake doesn't fill me with despair.
[k]

＠
Instead, I find myself entranced by the flames.[sr]The beautiful, magnificent flames.
[k]

＠
Even as they reduce my flesh to ash,[sr]I can feel the holy flames purifying my soul.

Thus began Jeanne d'Arc the Servant. The young girl's final moments, now little more than hazy memories.

Historically, this is where she[sr]is meant to be burned at the stake.

＠E：Mephistopheles
Even if, hypothetically speaking, we were to Rayshift in and save her at the last second...

Whether Jeanne is burned at the stake,[sr]or ends up dying of old age...
[k]

＠E：Mephistopheles
...her role in history has come to an end,[sr]and I doubt it would have any other effect.

＠E：Mephistopheles
If she succeeded at avoiding the stake and tried to stand on history's stage once more, I imagine there would be secret efforts made to...you know.
[k]

？1：Assassinate her...?

＠E：Mephistopheles
Indeed. I imagine Charles VII, or perhaps someone else, would betray her, and she would meet a bloody end nonetheless.
[k]

＠E：Mephistopheles
Indeed. I'm guessing she would be betrayed again,[sr]and end up getting murdered anyway.

...Well, at that point you saving my life won't matter. You'll get no mercy from me.

Good point.[sr]All right, here's my attempt at persuasion.

＠Mephistopheles
Master, I'd get out of here if I were you.

＠Mephistopheles
That shock alone has already transferred[sr]over half of Jeanne's power to her Alter.

[charaFace B 2]
＠Mephistopheles
Even if I joined you two,[sr]we'd all be hopelessly outmatched!

You do remember what your obligations are as the Master destined to save humanity, don't you?
[k]

？1：Yeah, I remember.
？！

[charaFace B 5]

...Then what's your answer?

Master, are you sure about this?

I'm at less than half my full power right now.[sr]We may both be Rulers, but she has the upper hand.

I'd bet the two Mephistopheles are evenly matched, too. There's no way we can win.

That way of thinking isn't going to get you very far.[sr]But, then again, that might be why I was summoned in the first place.

Look at the anger on their faces, just like monsters! Hmm... I think I'll go ahead and turn them into REAL monsters.
