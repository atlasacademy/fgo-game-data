Oh? Robin's buying things from that shop.[sr]Did you tell him to do that?
[k]

？1：Yes, I asked him to guard the area.

[charaFace A 1]

As expected, Senpai knows exactly what to do with[sr]Servants. If there's nothing to do, have them patrol.

Those beat up old blades? If you're just gonna give[sr]them to the blacksmith I'll take all you've got.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Oh, and a dozen lengths of rope.[sr]Throw in some rags, too.
[k]

＠Man
Yeah, sure thing. I'm glad you're taking this junk[sr]off my hands, but what will you use them for?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Robin Hood
Who knows? But junk's got its uses.[sr]You can put it together into something good.

Hey, this is a nice blanket.[sr]Didn't think I'd see something like this. I'll take it.
[k]

That's an expensive blanket.[sr]You sleep in your cape, what will you do with it?

[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
I'm kind of surprised to see you here Robin...[sr]It's rare for a Servant to go shopping.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Maybe so. Compared to the other guys, I'm a[sr]little plain, right? I feel more at home in places like this.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
But again, this is perfect timing.[sr]I'm going hunting, want to tag along?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Hunting? Is that code for you're going gambling?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Robin Hood
What kind of guy do you think I am?[sr]Not gambling, plain old hunting.

...Quietly. Quietly.[sr]I saw some weird animal tracks around here.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Robin Hood
I set some traps over the past few days... Got it![sr]Bingo! They fell for it.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Robin Hood
This area up ahead is a blind alley.[sr]It'll be easy to trap them.
[k]

？1：You really did mean hunting...

[charaFace D 1]
＠Robin Hood
Of course I did.[sr]What did you think I was doing?
[k]

＠Robin Hood
They didn't make me a Servant just because I'm good[sr]looking. I'm a master hunter.
[k]

？2：What did you trap?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Robin Hood
Haha, you'll have to find out.[sr]Something perfect for a growing Master.
