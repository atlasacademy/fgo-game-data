＠Scheherazade
Oh dear... This city is not safe at all. I had heard London was often shrouded in fog, but I never imagined it could be so dangerous...
[k]

？1：Cities aren't always safer.
？2：Cities have traffic accidents and stuff like that.
？！

[charaFace B 6]

＠Scheherazade
Indeed. As I thought, there's no place safer than home... Of course, staying indoors too much can put you at risk of dying from poor health.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Truly a dilemma for the ages...

＠Scheherazade
At any rate, you began your journey through this Demonic Fog-choked city by investigating the mysterious events taking place here in London.

＠Scheherazade
First you met Sir Mordred, a Knight of the Round Table.
[k]


＠Scheherazade
Her...issue with these events was a peculiar one. She did not allow anyone to destroy Britain, the land King Arthur loved. Not anyone, that is, save for herself.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
After meeting her, you encountered other allies living within this strange fog...

I must say that it is “B,” Charles Babbage,[sr]who I find the most fascinating.

His armor just looks...safe. It seems like it would be all but impossible to die with such protection... (Dreamy eyes)
[k]

＠Scheherazade
I don't know how his armor works,[sr]or what it's like on the inside...
[k]


＠Scheherazade
...but if it is possible for me to wear it,[sr]or something like it, I would love to do so.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Do you think he might be willing to make[sr]a similar set for me were I to ask?

At any rate, it turned out that the Massive Steam Engine Angrboda was producing the Demonic Fog, using the Holy Grail as a power source.
