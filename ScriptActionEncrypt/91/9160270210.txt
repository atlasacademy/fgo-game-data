...Hoho, when did the palace start allowing any old mongrel off the street inside?

＠Women's Voices
Someone must have felt sorry for her. Just look at that mane of bristles she calls hair. I only hope her stink doesn't rub off on us.
[k]

＠Women's Voices
I heard she's from the Bing Province, of all places. Ugh, I can smell the dirt on her all the way over here. I'll have to have someone sweep up after her, to make sure she doesn't leave any yellow sand on the floor.
[k]

＠Women's Voices
It doesn't matter how ostentatiously she dresses up.[sr]She'll always be a peasant at heart. You know what they say, “Can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.”

She doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell[sr]of winning the emperor's favor... Hohoho...

[f large]Good morning to Wu!
[k]

？1：You're in a good mood today, Your Imperial Majesty.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Wu Zetian
Kehehe, but of course.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
After all, a dynamic empire needs an energetic empress!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Wu Zetian
Indeed, energy is absolutely crucial!
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
If you like, I could run around this room right now to show you just how energetic I am.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Wu Zetian
Of course, it would be an imperial crisis if my noble feet were to get tired, so it would have to be you doing the running.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
But I am gracious enough to let you choose whether you will carry me via shoulder ride or piggyback.
[k]

？2：Morning, Zhaoie.

[charaFace A 5]
＠Wu Zetian
How dare you speak to me so casually! Are you looking for a bit of morning torture? Is that it?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Wu Zetian
Nn... Never mind...

[charaFace A 3]
＠Wu Zetian
...Well, I suppose you did not know what you were saying, since you have only just woken up.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Normally I would torture you for your insolence, but in this case, I suppose I will just have to chalk this up to a slip of the tongue brought on by your overwhelming affection for me.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

It would seem you get to live another day! Keh heh heh!

...Ahem.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
As you know, I once came up with a plan to overcome the closest thing I had to something resembling a weakness.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Naturally, it succeeded brilliantly. Any fears I may[sr]or may not have once had are now completely gone.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Wu Zetian
Hey! I see the doubt in your eyes! I am telling you,[sr]my fears are now well and truly conquered!

Which is why today, we will be[sr]taking the next step in the plan.

[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Wu Zetian
Worry not. This will not be nearly[sr]the ordeal that last time was.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
We will simply be doing what is necessary[sr]to improve upon what I already possess.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
It will be like reviewing for a test, or exercising to stay in shape...
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
While I am not usually in the habit of borrowing words from Xuanzang Sanzang, I believe we could call this “training”!
[k]

？1：Oh, then I'd be glad to help.
？2：It would be my honor to assist.
？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Wu Zetian
Good, good. I knew you had some sense.

That is a must, if you are going[sr]to rule this land alongside me.

[charaFace A 0]

I understand your confusion, but there can be no limit to the pursuit of beauty.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
I myself would be willing to consume all of creation[sr]in if it would improve my complexion. Keh heh heh.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
And since men are helpless in the face of beauty, one could say that men are also driven to pursue it endlessly.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
And so, beauty is an essential trait for any empress.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Wu Zetian
Though I of course have plenty to spare now, I could always stand to have more... The more the better, in fact!
[k]

What do you mean?[sr]Surely you've seen it when I fight, haven't you?

Especially when enemies are falling left and right in the face of the Pharaoh Fighting Style's sheer beauty.

＠Cleopatra
The moment you begin to rest on your laurels is the moment your beauty begins to fade away.

I'm not surprised, since there is no disputing that my program is perfect, but I'm glad to see you understand nonetheless.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
I commend you for your keen eye! Hohohoho!
[k]

？1：(I'm surprised they're hitting it off so well...)
？！

You know, when I showed it to Lord Caesar in the hope that he would use it to slim down a bit, he told me...
[k]

＠Cleopatra
“Yes, I understand the gist, but since subliminal advertising is prohibited by law, I'm afraid this will never do.”
[k]

＠Cleopatra
Then he just left, bemoaning what a tragic shame it was that his respect for the law prevented him from using it.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
And here I thought he would be thrilled with the idea of an exercise game that runs at 60 CPS (Cleopatras per second)...
[k]

＠Cleopatra
I guess there truly is more to success than simply building a fabulous product...

Men who are able to truly appreciate the effort that goes into real beauty are few and far between. Never mind that they are the ones who most demand it.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
There were scant few exceptions to be found even in all of China. The sooner you accept that that is simply how men are, the happier you will be.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Wu Zetian
At any rate, now that I understand how this regimen works, I think I will begin my training right away.

＠Wu Zetian
Oh yes, make sure you keep your eyes on me, Master! I want you to witness me growing more beautiful with every passing moment yourself!
[k]

？1：Good luck!
？2：Can't wait to see you pull off a dazzling Pharaoh Pose!

Oh, I almost forgot to mention. The game tracks your score, so I recommend you try to beat your own personal bests as you go!
[k]

＠Cleopatra
You'll score extra points if you[sr]pose at just the right time.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
I doubt you will reach my high score, since you lack the divine protection of Isis, but I am willing to give you hints as needed.

[charaFace B 2]

All right, let the Pharaoh Beauty Regimen begin!
