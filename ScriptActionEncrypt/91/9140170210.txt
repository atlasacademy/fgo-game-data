Where...?
[k]

＠Mash
Where is this place?[sr]I think I was resting at Chaldea...
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
I was trying to...[sr]sleep in my room, I think...

＠Marie Antoinette
[line 2]That's right.[sr]You were all asleep.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
What...?
[k]

？1：So sleepy...

？2：Huh? Marie?

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Marie Antoinette
You're both awake, then.[sr]Good morning♪
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
However, you both are actually still asleep.[sr]So am I, more precisely.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Your bodies are dreaming, but your minds are with me.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
So you can't hear the Doctor here.[sr]You can't contact Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
You understand what I'm saying now, don't you?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
We're dreaming...?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
The records say that a Servant and Master[sr]can share memories in their dreams.
[k]

＠Mash
But this...[sr]For us to recognize each other[line 2]
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
It's because Chaldea's summoning system[sr]is slightly different than normal summons.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
That's what happened.[sr]Or perhaps,
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
"You" are the only one dreaming, and the others are just characters in your dreams.
[k]

？1：Which means[line 2]

？2：???

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The dream of the butterfly, right?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
I wonder.[sr]Who's the dreamer, and who's the dream?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
But there's one thing I do know.[sr]Especially for me.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
This is...[sr]The place I must walk.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
The place you must walk...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
This is my Temple.[sr]Not the real one, of course.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
The Tour du Temple[line 2][sr]The place where Marie Antoinette awaited execution.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Then this is your mental landscape?[sr]This space, no, this place.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
That's what it looks like to me.[sr]How does it look to you?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
If my memories are reaching you, then it must look the[sr]same to you. Otherwise, perhaps you're seeing
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
the closest place to it in your own memories.[sr]Heheh, don't get scared, okay?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
It's all right.[sr]I'll be sure to lead you to the exit.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
That means we need[sr]to find a way to escape, doesn't it?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
Yes. [line 2]I'm sorry.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
These are my memories. What was once in my heart.[sr]A world where I waited for death, with no escape.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
But you two are different.[sr]And so I can get you out.
[k]

？1：Let's escape.

？2：Let's go together.

？！

＠Marie Antoinette
...Yes.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Marie Antoinette
Come, let's go.[sr]To the outside. To your real world.

[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
But I don't really feel lost.[sr]Is this your doing?
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
Yes.[sr]Because you two are here.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
I don't know if I could escape on my own.[sr]These are my memories of sorrow and misery.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Marie Antoinette
But you are here for me.[sr]I'm connected to you as a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Marie Antoinette
And so I won't lose my way.[sr]I'll make it to the exit[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
...Wait.[sr]Multiple presences detected ahead.

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
Magical energy responses?[sr]Wait, these aren't from living creatures.
[k]

＠Mash
...Though I don't know if you can[sr]feel magical energy in a dream.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Marie Antoinette
This is what I once felt.[sr]It's fear, death, and of course, sadness.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Marie Antoinette
...It's all right.[sr]We can win.
[k]

？1：Get ready, Mash.

？2：Let's break through.
