Listen up. You fought and defeated multiple pharaohs[line 3]myself included.

O Queen of the Mirror who lived in the ancient world... You're a perfect pharaoh in your own right.

It's pure arrogance to wish for any more than that.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
After all, it's established fact that I am the best and most venerable pharaoh. Anything more is fighting for scraps!

[charaFace F 0]
＠Ozymandias
You could be known only for your dark, vengeful acts... or for your numerous conquests... You could be the last of your kind...

You could even be a young pharaoh who only reigned for a few days...

No matter what kind of pharaoh you are, to me, there is very little difference!

Let's go somewhere else and keep drinking, Rider.[sr]This time get me some wine that will at least let me talk properly!

You're a Rider too, you know? We can keep drinking, but there's not much in the way of wine around here...

Oh, but I do know a king with a big attitude whose wine happens to be very good.

All he'd need to do is fetch some more from the storeroom... I wonder where he is?
