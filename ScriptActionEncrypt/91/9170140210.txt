＠Holmes
Heroic Spirits...
[k]


＠Holmes
...are usually created when a human being ascends beyond their humanity. At this point, they have yet to be assigned a class.
[k]


＠Holmes
For one thing, the very concept of classes only arose[sr]as a byproduct of the Heroic Spirit Summoning Ritual.
[k]

＠Holmes
Naturally, Chaldea's summoning system follows the same principles, typically assigning each Heroic Spirit one of the seven classes.
[k]

＠Holmes
But there are, of course, exceptions to this rule. Most potential problems can be avoided if there is an appropriate Extra class to which the Heroic Spirit can be assigned...
[k]


＠Holmes
...but there may also be times when a Heroic Spirit is forced into a class for which they may not be fully suited.
[k]

＠Holmes
Such cases can certainly become cause[sr]for distortion of one sort of another.

Remember, she's a Berserker. Most of her rational[sr]mind was sealed away when she materialized.

Ordinary people could never keep the fires of battle raging in their hearts at all times, but that's not the case for Berserkers.

[charaFace C 5]

However, that of course comes at a cost.

There's something that builds up deep[sr]down inside Berserkers over time.
