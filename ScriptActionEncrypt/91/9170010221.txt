Well, at least you were able to overcome that predicament, and somehow escaped.

It's pretty amazing that you were able to control Berserker under those circumstances. You're really quite something.

So, when you activated the Madness Enhancement,[sr][%1], your energy supply ran out.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Then Berserker also[sr]ran out of fuel and stopped moving...
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
No. Actually, after that, Heracles alone[sr]wiped out all the monsters in that area.
[k]

＠Mash
I know it's hard to believe, but...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Hmm, so it's possible we still didn't fully[sr]activate his "Madness Enhancement?"
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
No, way! That's crazy... Even a great Heroic Spirit[sr]of Olympus couldn't be that incredible, right?
[k]

？1：Who's to say?

？2：At any rate, it was a big help.
