Chiyome of the Kouga Mochizuki clan. You use your curse sooo expertly, yet you don't seem at all accustomed to it.

＠Shuten-Douji
What a waste. Don't you know how hard your ancestors worked to pass it down across generations?

They sure didn't go to all that effort just so you could cringe in terror at an illusion of a snake...

But you're a human-based Heroic Spirit, right, Chiyome? Don't you HAVE to overcome your weakness? Don't you want to?
