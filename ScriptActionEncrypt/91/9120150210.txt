Arjuna.

No obstacles remain for me.[sr]Even if they did, I would destroy them all.
[k]

＠Arjuna
This will be the end.[sr]I may be called a coward, but I will kill you.
[k]

＠Arjuna
I need to kill you![sr]You know me, after all!

...So this is karma. There is not room enough in the world for two supreme marksmen.

Is this truly victory?[sr]Or is this actually defeat?
[k]

＠
I have no sense of satisfaction,[sr]no joy from this victory...
[k]

＠
I don't even feel a sense of relief that the battle is over. The only thing that I have is this ceaseless feeling of emptiness.
[k]

＠
I just killed the man who knew me best.
[k]

＠
I have no regrets. My original sworn enemy...my oldest enemy. We were destined to fight each other. And yet...
[k]

＠
That man, who waded through battle after battle in blinding, golden armor...
[k]

＠
...was the one and only hero[sr]who knew the ugly side of me.
[k]

＠Arjuna
...Why, Karna?
[k]

＠Arjuna
Why...why did you smile?
[k]

＠
And then my life came to an end while I yet pondered that mystery.
[k]

＠
As Arjuna, the Hero of the Endowed...I existed to protect the future.

＠Arjuna
And then I was summoned as a Servant, and participated in many battles. I trust Master wholeheartedly.
[k]

＠Arjuna
[&He:She] may be ordinary, and there are times when [&he:she] is too optimistic...yet still, [&he's:she's] a good Master.
[k]

＠Arjuna
Faithful. Accurate decision-making skills. And [&he:she] does not treat us Servants as mere familiars. [&He:She] treats us with respect, but is not distant.
[k]

＠Arjuna
Many Servants would consider [&him:her] the ideal Master.[sr]I number myself among them.
[k]

＠Arjuna
That is why I unleashed the absolute limit of[sr]my Noble Phantasm's power. And yet...
[k]

＠Arjuna
I have yet to show my true face to Master.[sr]No, I mustn't show it...
[k]

＠Arjuna
My blunt ugliness out in the open...!

The most wonderful cause of saving the world.[sr]Ah...I cannot stop laughing.
