It is inherently difficult for humans to prevail against evil. The notion that they could defeat a god is similarly dubious.
[k]

＠
But when a human is summoned as a Servant, such lamentations should no longer be given voice.
[k]

＠
In China, there are two expressions that convey this idea well: “Shéng jù mù duàn,” and “Shuǐ dī shí chuān.”
[k]

＠
Roughly translated, they mean “Little strokes fell great oaks” and “Dripping water penetrates stone.”
[k]

＠
Therein lies the essence of human progress.

Although I lived to the age of sixty, and still retain memories[line 2]or rather, records of that time, I do not have any of the more temperate sensibilities I gained with age.

＠Inshun
I have no fondness for fighting to the death,[sr]but I do get a bit hotheaded from time to time.

？1：I'll say! You guys came dangerously close to killing each other, you know!

[charaFace C 3]

Haha, I am sorry about that, Master. I knew I should stop, but I simply couldn't help myself.

No, I haven't. If I did, there's no doubt in my mind that we would end up killing each other.

I'm sure my younger self knows that as well as I do. That's why we've made it a point to never be in the same place.

Hardly. If anything, it's the other way around.

I've devoted my life to perfecting my martial arts. If I'd come across an older version of me when I was young, I'd want to fight him too.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Li Shuwen
I'm sure he sees me as either the culmination or the conclusion of everything he's worked towards.
[k]

＠Li Shuwen
And as a young man, he would have no reason not to see how he measures up to that as he is now.

Indeed. I could not agree more.

[charaFace C 3]

＠Inshun
After all, it would be impossible for anyone besides a Servant to truly fight against oneself.
[k]

＠Inshun
And if that other self is a more mature version...
[k]

＠Inshun
...the urge to resist seeing whether your current self is stronger than your future self would be irresistible.

＠Li Shuwen
My younger, Lancer self would say he is.
[k]

＠Li Shuwen
And I would agree with him.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Li Shuwen
...That said...
[k]

＠Li Shuwen
...I would still win.
[k]

＠Li Shuwen
And as long as I know that for certain, I personally have no desire to fight my younger self.
[k]

＠Li Shuwen
...But, if you'd still like us to fight even knowing that, Master, I'd be happy to oblige.

I mean that strength alone is not the[sr]sole factor in deciding the victor.

For me, it is not the pinnacle of strength that I seek.

...It may sound like I'm just an old wolf that's lost his fangs, but this is a domain the Lancer can never reach. Kaka!

Though of course, if he has,[sr]that's all well and good too.

It would just mean my victory is even more assured.
