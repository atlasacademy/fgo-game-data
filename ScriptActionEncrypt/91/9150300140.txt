The story of the Third Singularity unfolded[sr]in the unknown waters of a vast ocean...
[k]


[charaFace B 3]
＠Scheherazade
This world, where the only land to be found was scattered islands, was one of adventure. It would have suited Sinbad's tales well.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
It was here that you two met...

...Francis Drake. I believe that, by the time you encountered her, she had already claimed a Holy Grail.

Though it was not the Grail that threatened humanity, I can scarcely imagine what a shock this discovery must have been for you...

＠Mash
Yes, I was very surprised. That is one of many reasons our encounter with her was so...impactful.
[k]

＠Mash
Drake was every bit as hearty, cheerful, and scary as her reputation made her seem...and she was also a joy to be around.
[k]

＠Mash
I'll always appreciate the lessons she taught me.

So you think you might've pulled me out of Chaldea and added me to your story world's Throne...?
[k]

＠Drake
And THEN you think you might've mixed me with a replica you downloaded from that Throne to get someone to play this role of yours?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Drake
Haha! I got not the slightest clue about whatever you're goin' on about here. 'Specially since you're not exactly bein' clear about any of it.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Drake
I suppose you mean something that[sr]happened way back then, but still...
[k]

＠Drake
All I really know's that I might've gotten whisked away somewhere while I was lazing around Chaldea...
[k]

＠Drake
...and that I was back before I even realized I'd been gone. I mean, I don't remember any of what happened in between, so...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Drake
So I don't see much point prostrating yourself over something we're not even sure happened. I'd actually rather you didn't. Kinda weirding me out.
[k]

＠Drake
So get your ass outta the air and yourself off the floor, yeah? You're a lot hotter when your head isn't down.[sr]I'll take that view anytime.

How 'bout this. You wanna make up for whatever you think you did to me? Buy me a drink.

You got a gift for storytelling, yeah? Actually been lookin' for a chance to talk to you 'bout that.
[k]

＠Drake
Things can get real dull when you're out to sea. Telling stories is just about all you can do to liven things up for the crew.
[k]

＠Drake
Doesn't take long for anyone who's even halfway decent at that to get popular with the crew. I learned that one the hard way.
[k]

＠Drake
So, if you REALLY wanna do right by me,[sr]then teach me how to tell a good story.
[k]

＠Drake
Start with somethin' fun that'll[sr]make the rum go down easy.
