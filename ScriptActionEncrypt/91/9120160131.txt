You up now, Master?

＠Emiya Alter
There was something strange happening with my Spirit Origin. It happened right around the time your vitals started going haywire.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Guess you and I were sharing one[sr]of those Servant dream things.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
You look like you're all right now, but make sure you get yourself a mental health checkup too.

So? What'd you see in there?

Whatever you saw wasn't worth remembering.[sr]It was just one possible end to one man's life.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Emiya Alter
Well, whatever you're sad about, I'm sure you don't have to be. When you get right down to it, I'm just a bullet.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I don't have any thoughts or ideals. Once you fire me, I'm gone. Out of sight, out of mind.
