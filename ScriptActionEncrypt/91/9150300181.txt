All I wanted, all I could think about, was my need to escape my fear of death...to disappear to somewhere where death no longer existed.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Scheherazade
I see now how truly hollow that desire was. All I was doing was refusing to see the value of my own life.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
...Yes... Even had I found solace[sr]in death, I should have realized...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
...there is a tremendous difference between dying without having ever attempted anything of significance, and dying without any regrets...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
There were many things I never did when I was alive...many things I should have done. I died with so many regrets...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
I understand now...looking back...I should have known better than to be envious of him...
[k]

？1：That's what you wanted to understand...?

？！

[charaFace C 0]

＠Scheherazade
...Understand. Yes. That's it exactly.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
I had heard of his stories. That was not enough, though.[sr]I wanted[line 2]I needed to understand them, in the truest sense of the word.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
I wanted to...experience the truth of those stories for myself, as much as humanly possible.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
I know I could never hope to fully understand,[sr]that it was arrogant to even try...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
...but I had hoped that by experiencing your story,[sr]and his, even if only a little...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
...maybe I would be able to imagine what it might have been like...if I had been there with you all along.
[k]

？1：...
？！

＠Scheherazade
At their heart...stories are the embodiment of imagination, and of empathy.

＠Scheherazade
As a storyteller, I should have known that...yet I failed to understand this story, because I heard it secondhand.

In consequence, I just...strung its words together, utterly without imagination or empathy.
[k]


[charaFace C 6]


＠Scheherazade
I accepted this secondhand version, seeing only what I wanted to see...envying what I thought I desired.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
But that is not how a story should be.
[k]

Now that I've experienced the story for myself,[sr]as much as I can, and understand it more fully...
