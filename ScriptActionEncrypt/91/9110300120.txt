I wanna be the cutest girl ever.[sr]That way I'll be gucci when I finally meet “the one.”

[charaFace B 16]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Like...I've got no idea if any other versions of me already met “the one” somewhere, or if I'm gonna meet him myself one day...
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
...but I am totes certain he's out there.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
He's, like, gotta be perfect. Someone I can devote all my love and stuff to. And be a killer hot bae.

[k]

[charaFace B 17]


＠Suzuka Gozen
...Besides, the way I see it, a top-tier high school girl's gotta know how to play the game, which means she's gotta be used to hanging out with guys.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
If my future boyfriend gets away 'cause I end up freezing at a crucial moment, that'd just be the worst, right?
[k]

？1：I...guess you might be right.
？2：Wouldn't a naive, innocent girl have her own appeal?

[charaFace B 14]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Um, no. Obviously.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Suzuka Gozen
I mean, you HAVE heard about the whole, like, missed connection thing, right? You get ONE shot to say the right thing, and if you blow it, it's all over!

[charaFace B 15]

＠Suzuka Gozen
So I can't just sit in my tower waiting for Prince Charming or whatever! I gotta go on the ATTACK!

Right, yeah, anyways... Hmm, I don't really have a clear picture, you know? I mean, if I did, that'd sure make finding “the one” way easier.

＠Suzuka Gozen
So I guess I'll know what I'm looking for when I see it.

＠Mash
...I see. So you can't say anything for[sr]sure until you've actually met him...

Oh, yeah, totally! That's it exactly![sr]Don't overthink it and all, right?

If you wanna talk, talk. If not, don't.[sr]You just gotta figure it out as you go, right?
