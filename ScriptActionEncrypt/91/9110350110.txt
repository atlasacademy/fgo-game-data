I know little about the workings of the “simulator,” but I do know that a mysterious killer has been appearing there as of late.

It is fortunate that this began during Master's absence, as they were quite a formidable foe...

I imagine they were taking the form of a dead man's essence, much like we Heroic Spirits.

But now, they must have lost sight of who they are, and so have turned on those of us who carry blades of our own. What a pity.

With all that intricate data in the registry, it's entirely possible that a bit could have gotten scrambled somewhere and caused a problem.
