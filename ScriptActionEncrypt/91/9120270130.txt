Looks like word of Chloe's evil doings has spread.[sr]Perhaps now your wicked quest will come to an end.
[k]

＠Chloe
But I haven't finished playing around... I mean...I still haven't found someone who's compatible with me!
[k]

？1：Time to quit...
？2：The Serial Kisser Squad will be dissolved...
？！

[charaFace B 7]

＠Mash
Indeed. We got dragged into this because of Chloe's insistence, but that will now come to an end. We cannot overlook your deeds any more.

＠Mash
If you continue to corrupt Chaldea's morals,[sr]I will stand in your way as Chaldea's shield!

Mash is betraying me now!? Unbelievable...[sr]Desertion will not be permitted!

Come on! Don't be such a square just because you wear glasses! You dummy! You...Mashmallow Goody Two-shoes!
[k]

＠Mash
I never once joined your squad, and I am not acting like a square. Also I don't understand why you'd call me Mashmallow.

Ungh... That Shielder is so serious.[sr]Fine. Be that way.

[charaFace B 13]

＠Mash
Whew. I'm glad she listened.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Chloe
But there's one thing I want you to know: it may seem like I was playing around, but I really did want to make myself stronger.
[k]

＠Chloe
I want to get strong for [%1]...[sr]No, I wanted to be useful for [&big brother:big sister]...
[k]

＠Mash
Chloe...
[k]

＠Mash
Don't worry. I believe you. Sometimes you may go overboard, but I also know you have an inherent kindness within you.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Mash
As for you getting stronger... Let's think about it together. I'm sure we'll find something for you.

[charaFace A 4]

Thanks.[sr]But...it's fine.
