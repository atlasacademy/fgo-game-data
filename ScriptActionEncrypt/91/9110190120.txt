＠Karna
Move on to the second trial, but proceed with caution.[sr]It may not be as easy as this one.

A hero that Karna thinks makes him seem insignificant...

Do you think he's being humble?[sr]Karna is quite modest...

I hope that's all it is. These are, after all,[sr]heroes gathered specifically for this trial...
