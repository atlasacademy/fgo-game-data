Teacher, I have a question.[sr]What's the difference between a lizard and a dragon?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Georgios
Good question. To answer, first we'll have[sr]to talk about the phantasmal species[line 2]

Oh, right... But we need to get going...[sr]to the next dimensional distortion.

True. That's enough prepping, we will continue the lecture as in-field studies.

Our goal this time is to repair a space that became unstable due to the last Rayshift.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The problem should have fixed itself when we restored the timeline, but a little remained.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
My analysis shows that a number of phantasmal species, AKA dragons, have fled there.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
If we don't fix it, the distortion may cause a wide-scale dimensional collapse.

So the distortion isn't disappearing because of the dragon's magical energy, right?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Georgios
Phantasmal species...dragons in particular[sr]generate magical energy just by breathing.
[k]

＠Georgios
The output of such energy is capable of maintaining the distortion.

It's a rare phenomenon, but I'm detecting draconic essence from our surroundings.

Yes, Master let me borrow it.[sr]There were none in my time.

＠Georgios
It is a truly powerful relic that instantly paints what you see.

At first, I just collected the paintings, but lately I've gotten into it.

Look at this new lens for instance![sr]Photography is a fascinating and endless abyss.
