All right, let's discuss our next task.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Now that I have refined my outer beauty,[sr]the next step is to refine my inner beauty.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Wu Zetian
I speak, of course, of intellect!

？1：So what's the game plan?

[charaFace A 0]
＠Wu Zetian
As an empress[line 2]the very pinnacle of the upper layer[line 2]I naturally possess a wealth of cultural skills fit for high society.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Those are what I will be refining next.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
That certainly applies to the four traditional Chinese skills of a noble[line 2]namely, stringed instruments, strategical thinking, calligraphy, and painting...
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
...but as a woman of culture, I intend to improve my skills in all the finer arts.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Wu Zetian
And once again, I already know who[sr]to ask to be my instructor. Come!

He spread essays denouncing me all around my imperial city. They were written extraordinarily well...

Oops. A bad habit of mine.
[k]

？1：Bad habit?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Wu Zetian
It all goes back to when I was talking to one of the emperor's advisor monks, before I became empress myself.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
He said I lacked the foundation I needed to be empress, and that I would never be able to assuage the people's concerns if I remained as I was.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
That was when we turned our eyes towards a certain set of sutras which detailed a beautiful woman's rise to power.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
He then suggested that I become that woman myself, or rather, that I become something akin to Maitreya.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
I thought this was a brilliant new interpretation on his part, so I quickly agreed.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
But as I had him write down the sutra's contents, I started to believe that interpretation myself...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Wu Zetian
And soon, the new sutras we created had spread far and wide, thus securing positions for both of us!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Wu Zetian
And that has left me in the habit of unconsciously making myself a character in the sutras I copy...
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Yes, that about sums it up.
