Wow, it sure is nice to relax in a mountain inn,[sr]isn't it, Master?

Oh, a message from Kiyohime?[sr]What does it say...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
"Today I went shopping with my Master, who is also my husband."
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
"We went to a famous French clothing store... Oh, what was its name? Anyway, there my Master bought me some Western-style clothes."
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
"I get so put on the spot by things like this. So Tamamo, do you... Oh. (Gotcha.)"
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
"Anyway, I'll text again sometime. -from France with love- Your Kiyohime"

[charaFace C 2]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
This again! I'm asking you, what the hell is this?[sr]What the hell is this, this (Gotcha.)?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
In the first place, I'm sure her partner is being tricked!
[k]

？1：Not Kiyohime?

？2：The partner is!?

？！

[charaFace C 5]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Yes. It's not polite to say, but unlike me,[sr]Kiyohime can get the weirdest ideas in her head.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Tendencies for love at first sight aside, she often creates[sr]relationships in her mind without talking to the men involved.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Her imagination when it comes to these things could put virtual reality to shame. Every relationship she imagines already has marriage on the horizon.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Ultimately she traps the guy inside a bell and burns him to death. That's how she is, so I worry about her partner...

This isn't fair![sr]My texting buddy does this to me every single day!
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

Her texts always sound so happy![sr]I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!
[k]

？1：Me neither.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Wyverns, flying lizards, I don't know what you are...[sr]But how I feel on all those Sundays...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
The feeling that I should do something meaningful[sr]but ends up on the couch, getting nothing done...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Then after a bath, realizing I'm already getting into bed...[sr]That dismal feeling...
[k]
