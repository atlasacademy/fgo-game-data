We did it, Master!
[k]

？1：We killed the dragons!

？2：Is this all?

？！

＠Georgios
No, these were a lower subspecies of dragon called wyverns.
[k]

＠Georgios
These wyverns lack the magical energy to maintain such a space as this.

This reaction's incredible...[sr]It's three times bigger than a normal dragon!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I mean, there aren't really normal dragons, but...[sr]What's going on here?

A mutation...or something like it?
[k]

＠Georgios
No, nothing so simple.[sr]It feels as if it's absorbed the others.
[k]

？1：Absorbed them?

？2：You mean it ate them?

？！

＠Georgios
Yes, I've never seen a cannibalistic dragon before.[sr][line 3]It has power, but little intelligence.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Georgios
Either way, it's still a rare species.[sr]Let me take a photograph.

You can do that later![sr]But if it ate the other dragons...
[k]

A dragon's just a giant lump of magical energy...[sr]If it ate them all...this thing is crazy!

Mr. Geo, how do we deal with this?

Calm down, Mash. Your teacher's[sr]name is Mr. Georgios, not Mr. Geo.

＠Georgios
And it doesn't matter what kind of dragon it is, none shall survive our attack.

Dragons were born to be eradicated.[sr]Be punished for your sins, dragon!
