Yes, we've retrieved the sword.

＠Gilles
...Master, are you familiar with the[sr]legend of Jeanne d'Arc and this sword?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Gilles
She always waved the flag to encourage us and[sr]was always on the front lines, but[line 2]
[k]

＠Gilles
She never drew her sword.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Gilles
I asked her if she was afraid of getting blood on her[sr]hands. She gave me a peculiar answer.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Gilles
"No, for when I wave this flag, my hands become one with yours."
[k]

＠Gilles
"However, I am embarrassed to say that I am[sr]unskilled with the sword. Forgive me."
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Gilles
She never drew her sword.[sr]However, she carried our sin with us.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Gilles
[line 2]That being the case, I will not tolerate[sr]anyone drawing this sword but her.
[k]

＠Gilles
Someday, somewhere, she will need to draw this sword.[sr]Until then, I must protect it properly.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Gilles
...I appreciate you accommodating my personal affairs.
[k]

＠Gilles
Let's continue to fight together!
