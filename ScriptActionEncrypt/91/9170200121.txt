＠Cú Chulainn Alter
We've managed to get rid of a good number.[sr]Okay, we're going to dash through.
[k]

？1：Are you angry?
？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
I don't agree, but I'm not mad.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...But now I know you're that kind of Master.[sr]From here on, I just have to handle you differently.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Come on, we're going to walk a bit more.[sr]Master, what about food and water?
[k]

？1：Uh...
？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...You wanna starve?[sr]We can't go back.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Chew on tree roots and lick the stones.[sr]Don't you dare complain. This is your own doing!

＠
And after that?
[k]

＠
Afterward, they managed to meet up with[sr]Mash Kyrielight, and that was it.
[k]

＠
Nothing was physically gained from that incident, but they went through a valuable experience...at least I want to think so.
[k]

＠
Even for [%1], chewing on tree roots to survive isn't an everyday occurrence.
[k]

＠
Report completed.[sr]Recorder is □□　□□□□□□□□.
[k]

＠
Now then...I wonder if someone's going to read through this massive Rayshift report someday.
[k]

＠
Or maybe it will never see the light of day...considering the future to be saved, and what lies after that.
