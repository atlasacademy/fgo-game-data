＠Fionn
Oh, yeah. Well, I guess it turned out to be that.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
That was an unknown enemy we've met multiple times. We have no accurate data on it[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
But you talked as if you knew something about it.[sr]Is it possible...you have some idea?

[charaTalk B]

Right, so...that's how it is...[sr]He really is ignoring me...

That said, this is just a hunch.[sr]I don't have enough evidence right now.

[charaFace D 5]
＠Fionn
As captain of the glorious Knights of Fianna, I can't afford to make an unsightly mistake in front of a lady.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Fionn
So, could you give me some time?[sr]When I have solid proof, I'll most definitely tell you.

Boring!?[sr]If it'll tell us everything, then use it, please?

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Like making a prediction about the King of Mages' next move! There are other things I'd like to know as well so... Please?
[k]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 1]
＠Fionn
Hah hah hah. I'd say he probably set up some countermeasures so it can't be easily predicted. Same goes for that giant hand.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Fionn
I did ask you to wait, but there are things that we can talk about without waiting.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Fionn
So, let's go to My Room and discuss in detail. You're curious about me, too, right?
[k]

？1：You said “about me” just now?
？2：That room isn't yours, is it?

？！

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 5]
＠Fionn
...Right. Okay, [%1] can come, too. That's fine by me!
