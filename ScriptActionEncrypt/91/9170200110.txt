Even a single mistake in a Rayshift cannot be allowed. Or at least, that would be the case were there no opponents awaiting the team.
[k]

＠
Is this mere chance? The whim of a Demon God Pillar?[sr]Or is it simply human error?
[k]

＠
Whatever the case, on that day in 2018, only a short while after Cú Chulainn Alter was summoned...
[k]

＠
Humanity's last Master, [%1],[sr]was in a dire situation.
[k]

＠
Hm? Dire situations are the order of the day here?[sr]Well, be that as it may, THIS particular situation was something rather special.
[k]

＠
Master's most trusted Servant,[sr]Mash Kyrielight, was not by [&his:her] side.
[k]

＠
It was not long after the difficult, arduous task of correcting the Singularity in America had been completed.
[k]

＠
Of all Chaldea's Servants,[sr][&he:she] took only Cú Chulainn Alter...
[k]

＠
...on a forty-eight hour journey.

＠Cú Chulainn
Bluntly, an Alter is another side of us...just another possibility.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
For example: heroes, no matter what kind of life they lived, almost always end up with blood on their hands.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Even heroes who like to think of themselves as good remain aware that they have a merciless side to them.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
What would happen if their other side was brought to the forefront? Pretty obvious, don't you think?

It goes without saying that we are conscious that our living selves and ourselves as we are now are more or less the same.
[k]

＠Tristan
However, even I cannot make any claim to sainthood.
[k]


＠Tristan
A virtuous king can turn cold-blooded.[sr]A cold-blooded king becomes virtuous.
[k]

＠Tristan
A mad dog of a knight had a time to shine bright.[sr]And the opposite rings true.
[k]


＠Tristan
And there are those who fell from grace, those who fell into darkness, or were driven into it by events beyond their control.

That is the man I ultimately become.[sr]An Anti-Hero, a mass-murderer, a truly evil man.

＠Gilles de Rais
As painful as it may be, it is not something I can simply avoid...
[k]


＠Gilles de Rais
I must acknowledge that he is another side of me...[sr]I mustn't avert my gaze from that truth...

The real issue is that they're not exactly just another side of us. They've mutated somehow.
[k]


＠Cú Chulainn
The other me fused with Medb's far-fetched idea of me as a king.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Guess it happened since humanity is so unstable.[sr]Otherwise, I'd have been less of a jerk.

What?[sr]You scared, [%1]?
[k]

[charaTalk on]

？1：Not really.

[charaFace A 5]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Don't act so tough.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
We lost communication, we're low on food and water,[sr]and I'm the only Servant you've got.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Standing there, saying you're not scared?[sr]Liar.
[k]

？2：Well, to be honest...

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
I knew it.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
We lost communication, we're low on food and water,[sr]and I'm the only Servant you've got.

We did try to kill each other the last time we were here. Am I wrong?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
No, I'm not. You and I fought to the death.[sr]You, [%1].
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
If you're a Master, you are responsible for your Servants in battle. No matter the opponent, the ultimate decision to fight is on you.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
That's why I fought against you and lost.[sr]Isn't that right?

But now it's just a faint memory. Look at that.[sr]While we were chit-chatting, enemies surrounded us.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
So what'll it be, Master? Retreat or meet the attack head-on? You better choose.
[k]

？1：Attack.
？！

[bgm BGM_EVENT_4 0.1]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Got it. Good, a quick decision.[sr]You didn't even hesitate. I like it.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Now it's time for a massacre.[sr]This lot isn't even hardy enough to be a good meal.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Still, no harm in an appetizer here and there!
