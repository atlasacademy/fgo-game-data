Indeed there is.[sr]It is exactly as you say.

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Five days ago, I noticed the foul stench of a monster not of this world within the simulator...

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
...but I can find no other trace of it anywhere.

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
I could not trouble you with this matter until I had proof, so I have been wandering the simulator tracking its scent.
