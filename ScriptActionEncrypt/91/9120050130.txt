That's the statue of the goddess?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Atalante
Yes, it's handmade.[sr]Impressive, right?
[k]

？1：If you just add Orion there.

？2：Needs more Orion.

＠Atalante
Y-You want me to make one of him? Hmm...[sr]He's the type of person I hate most.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Atalante
He's lazy, lustful, and never learns. He's only[sr]interested in having fun, and doesn't care for others.
[k]

＠Atalante
...He did look like he was having fun, but that fun is far too different for my tastes.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Atalante
Not my type of man at all. If I had to pick[sr]between him and Jason, I don't know what I'd do.

I-It's that bad?

＠Atalante
Let me ask you, Mash. If Jason and Orion were the[sr]last two men in the world, who would you marry?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Huh? I'd um...[sr]Well...

Hehehehe. Even if it's the truth,[sr]denying it is proof of my love!

So let's do this![sr]If I win you'll never get my blessing again.

I don't know about my Brother, though!
