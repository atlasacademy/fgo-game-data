Hello! As ever, you have that sad puppy[sr]look on your face, Master![charaEffectStop A bit_talk_41]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cleopatra
But that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all. Everything is!
[k]

＠Cleopatra
Besides, it's the common crossbreed pups with that doe-eyed sad look who stop passersby at the pet shop windows.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
Too many expensive breeds with bright eyes and[sr]shining coats could intimidate people passing by!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cleopatra
That's why you shouldn't feel ashamed and[sr]actually be proud of being a hot ticket item.

[charaFace A 2]

Such disrespect! And yet how refreshing! Whatever should I do!? What kind of reward would you like, for offering such new experience to me!?

But I realized that I had[sr]forgotten something crucial.

[charaFace A 4]

It's something that should have been done much earlier, and I feel that failing to do so has caused certain complications to arise.

And thus, I am able to make time, without any warning, and without opening up anyone's schedule and do this...
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

I do not visit Master's room that often...so I wish to immortalize this moment with a photo shoot!

If you still don't understand now, then you[sr]will just have to come and see for yourself.

[charaFace A 2]

A professional photo shoot obviously requires a talented photographer. We must first recruit a cameraman!

If that is what you require, I'd be happy to accept...[sr]But I was actually on my way to the Saints' Club...

[charaFace C 1]
＠Georgios
As the name entails,[sr]it is a meeting of the saints here in Chaldea.
[k]

＠Georgios
There's no official agenda, but I believe there[sr]is a purpose for me in joining such a club.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Georgios
Yes... For example, should a saintly woman with excessive strength start shadow boxing all of a sudden...
[k]

＠Georgios
Or should a mysterious, saint-like individual[sr]from the Far East chuckle menacingly...
[k]

＠Georgios
Or if a precocious young saint[sr]asks where babies come from...
[k]

＠Georgios
Or if a dark saintly woman who shows contempt[sr]for sainthood mistakenly gets captured on film...
[k]

When such a time comes, I will need to be present.[sr]Oh, my Lord...

Unlike that obscure and unfulfilling labor that you mentioned, the job that I am requesting you to do is quite simple. Rewarding. Coveted, in fact.

In better times, my worshippers (read: fans) would have desired even the tiniest reminder of my beauty to keep and gaze upon lovingly in their homes...

And they would have gladly waited in long lines carrying their expensive memory-preserving machines that were purchased with their life savings!

Ungh... He cannot seem to grasp my simple logic. Even a child would have understood. He really must not know a thing about beauty.

He must have lived an abstentious life, which led to him forgetting what it even means to love beauty.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
So obsessed with sainthood.[sr]How sad...

？1：Well, he IS a saint...
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cleopatra
It's fine.[sr]I have found our directive.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
The reason why this man is not accepting the honor of being my photographer is because he is a sad, sad man who does not appreciate beauty.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
In order to regain such appreciation, words will not suffice. Rather, he needs a shock to his system to free him of his silly notions.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
Yes...yes. If that is what is needed,[sr]then we have no choice.
