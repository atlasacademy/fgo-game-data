＠Quetzalcoatl
An orthodox fighter and a flying rudo. I very[sr]much enjoyed it. So who is my final opponent?

Sorry to make you wait.[sr]Your final opponent will be me, Mask de Baritsu.

Ah, a masked wrestler is also one of the highlights of Lucha Libre! He will be quite a formidable end to this three-round match, yes!

＠Mask de Baritsu
My observations are complete. I can see that your body is positively riddled with wounds from the previous matches, and that you are running low on stamina.
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
While I am a gentleman who prefers to play fair, I am not always able to do so. I only engage in battle when I have a significant advantage over my opponent.
[k]

？1：Well, THAT is a terrible thing to say...
？2：Impressive, Baritsu Mask. That's smart.

？！

＠Mask de Baritsu
Indeed. By the way, my Baritsu is a well-rounded mix of strikes, throws, and holds. It's the ultimate self-defense martial art.
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
You have no chance of winning.[sr]Would you like to withdraw?

Your concern is unnecessary, Baritsu Mask.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Fatigue and injury are everyday things for a luchadora! And actually, I'm in top condition right now, yes!

I was hoping for that response.[sr]Then let us begin our match, Miss Quetzalcoatl.
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
But...why are you and Master not calling me by my proper nom de guerre?
