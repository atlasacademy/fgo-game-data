Hot! Hot, hot! Damn you, Gawain!

Attacking me during the day... Coward! If you're a true knight, then spring a surprise attack at night, fair and square!

A thoughtless imbecile deserves a harsh punishment. Especially when they are a family member.

＠Gawain
Honestly... I didn't expect you to be someone who would have bought these stolen goods. I am not Sir Tristan, but I must say that this saddens me.
[k]

＠Gawain
I can overlook your boorish manners, but I never thought that even you would stoop so low as to purchase stolen goods.

'Course I'd get involved.[sr]I'm Mordred, the great king-killer!
[k]

＠Mordred
When I sit the throne, I'll need a trusted minister.[sr]You know, like a minister of finance.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Mordred
I had to fire that cheap-ass Agravain,[sr]and I wanted someone rich in his place...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Mordred
And y'know, that Caesar guy's pretty hefty. Looks like a guy who never misses a meal, so he must be rich!

Well, you must disassociate yourself from that gluttonous Roman aristocrat! You've been summoned in modern times, so you should be eating vegetables! Potatoes!

No, you must understand. As penance, you will eat only from a menu I specially design for one full month!
[k]

＠Gawain
First of all, ketchup is not a vegetable, so you may not have it. You may consume only potatoes.

？1：It's for your own good, Mordred.

＠Mordred
I know that, but...Gawain's always trying to play at being a big brother when no one else from the Round Table is around...
[k]

？2：We're taking the materials.

Yes, let's collect the materials, Master. Let's see, two Octuplet Crystals... We're still missing two.
[k]


＠Gawain
So they've been used... Well, I'll let that slide.[sr]Oh? Are we also missing a Great Knight Medal...?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Gawain
What is the meaning of this, Mordred?[sr]So far as I know, you have no use for that catalyst.

Yeah, I don't use it, but I want it![sr]Don't you get it!?
[k]

？1：...You want it as a keepsake, right?

[charaFace B 3]
＠Mordred
Y-yeah. It's not about showing off or anything like that... But I thought I could have at least one...
[k]

？2：Come on, a king wouldn't need a medal to prove themselves...

[charaFace B 1]
＠Mordred
You're right! Come to think of it,[sr]I'm the one who should be GIVING those out!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Mordred
So...it's fine. Even if I don't have any Great Knight Medals left to hand out. Not like I care or anything...

Now, let us move on to our next materials to recover. Next up: ten Hearts of the Foreign God.
