Nothing, Piglet. There were no more mishaps, happenings, or even minor inconveniences worth mentioning after that.
[k]

＠Circe
The Argonauts defeated every monster on board the ship and dispelled Medea's self-destructive curse.
[k]

＠Circe
After that, I thanked them, threw them a big kykeon farewell party, and sent them on their merry way.
[k]

＠Circe
And you already know the rest from the myth.

All right, you have your own stuff to take care of, right, Master? Go on then, get out of here.
