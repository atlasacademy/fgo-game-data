＠Wu Zetian
Neehahaha.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Yes, I forgot to mention I also summoned Hokusai to instruct me in painting, and Zhuge Liang to instruct me in strategy.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Wu Zetian
...Now that I think about it, perhaps there was no real need to gather them all in one place...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Wu Zetian
At any rate, getting kicked out of the library did not stop me from completing all my classes outside it.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
To think I would learn to play both the harp and the guitar... Sometimes, I even impress myself.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
I suppose I will need to prepare a reward for that noisy skull woman too.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Her teaching style, such as it was, may have amounted to little more than shouting “Harder! Faster! More rockin'!” but I appreciate her enthusiasm nonetheless.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Wu Zetian
At any rate, this should take care of my cultural refinement quite nicely.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Putting aside the fact that Servants are already summoned in the prime of their lives to begin with...
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
...I daresay I am more beautiful and knowledgeable now than I ever was before!
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Indeed, even if I were to return[sr]to the Inner Palace as I am now[line 2]

It doesn't matter how much you polish yourself. What a joke to never receive an invitation from the emperor. You'll never be anything more than a country bumpkin...

What's that?[sr]...A reward for your efforts...?
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
I-I see. Well, I do appreciate your devotion, and an empress should not be so uncouth as to not reward it. Very well, you may carry me if you wish.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
What? My next destination?[sr]No, I am done with training. Just take me home.

If I do any such training,[sr]it will be without you around.

Do not misunderstand me. I am not at all ashamed.

＠Wu Zetian
Poison and torture are necessary for the way I run my empire. I am proud to include them among my tools.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Wu Zetian
I simply do not feel like working on them now, is all.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Wu Zetian
...Of course I am well aware that you[sr]would not enjoy seeing me deploy them.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Wu Zetian
That is why I did not include them in this recent batch of self-improvement.

What would be the point in improving something that only makes you uncomfortable? What I need is...

I can't believe she keeps choosing that over trying to curry favor with us, or even with some other authority. What an idiot...

The fact that she really believes the emperor will notice her as long as she tries hard enough just goes to show what a child she is...

You're wrong. You have to be wrong. Shut up, you silk-draped vixens. I don't want to hear it.

This is the emperor of all of China we're talking about. He won't fail to notice a star that truly shines bright. That's why the Inner Palace exists to begin with.
[k]

＠
And for that very reason, the women who come to reside here should always focus on polishing themselves until they glow!
[k]

＠
It might take a long time.[sr]It might not be an easy path.
[k]

＠
But improving myself in all the aspects the emperor likes[line 2]beauty, intellect, calligraphy, music...

...until I shine so brightly that he can't[sr]help but invite me into his inner circle...

I know this is the way.[sr]I have no doubts or hesitations in that regard...

That's right. As my Master,[sr]I wanted you to think highly of me.

I thought I needed to refine the aspects of me that would make you proud to be seen walking around beside me.

Otherwise, there's a chance you might just...

...I see. Yes, that is right.

＠Wu Zetian
It is my own fault for being tired and getting sleepy. It is the fault of your rocking for being so comfortable.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
And it is your fault for being so dense.[sr]So yes, I was merely talking in my sleep.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Wu Zetian
There are many different people here, just like in the Inner Palace. People who are waiting for you to talk to them.

＠Wu Zetian
I am sure that number will only continue to grow in the future, but...
