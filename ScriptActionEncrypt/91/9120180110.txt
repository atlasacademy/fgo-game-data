Oh... I'm sorry, it seems I spaced out a little.[sr]What do you mean by “nice”?

[charaFace C 1]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
Oh, it's nothing, Mash.[sr]Just something that crossed my mind.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Um... “Mash”? It is kind of refreshing hearing that from you.

[charaFace C 0]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
You don't like me saying your name?[sr]I can call you something else if it's too frank.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Oh, no, it's not that. I am just a little surprised you would use my name.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
Oh. Well, I'm glad it doesn't bother you. Ah... Come to think of it, this place is full of things that I'm glad about.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
First and foremost, I'm glad you summoned me.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Huh... What do you mean?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
I mean I'm glad you didn't summon my adult self.[sr]It seems something strange is going on this time...
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
So there's a possibility that my adult self would be summoned at the same time.

To be honest, we're not sure how to act around you either... I mean, what should we call you?

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
No, wait. Safety first. I have to be careful with my words... My king, how would you like for us mongrels to address you?

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
I don't lash out just because I don't like something.[sr]Geez, that guy is such a man-child.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
(I bet the world's oldest King of Heroes never imagined his childhood self would be dissing him like this...)
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
At any rate, you can be casual with me... I know.[sr]You can call me Gil.
[k]

？1：It's good to meet you, Gil.

[charaFace C 1]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
It's good to meet you too, Master.
[k]

？2：It's a pleasure to meet you, future King Gil!

[charaFace C 1]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
Oh please, Master.[sr]I'm just a Servant. An Archer.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
Just treat me like any other Servant.
[k]

I feel the same. ...I am happy to have you around, Gil.

Likewise. Oh! I just thought of another thing that I'm glad about.

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
I know I'm repeating myself, but I'm so glad that I got to meet a wonderful person like you, Mash.

＠Mash
Huh...?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
Just so you know, I actually have a good eye for women.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
As for my adult self, however, he probably wouldn't even notice your beauty...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
...Wait, actually... He might be attracted to certain aspects of you.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
It's just a feeling, I'm not sure how to probably put that into words...
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
But anyway, I for one appreciate how lovely and sweet you are. Although sometimes you can get a little too serious...
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
P-Please don't tease me, Gil...
[k]

？1：I agree 100%.
？2：I've known that from the beginning!

？！

Senpai, you too!?

(Sigh) Just when I was about to enjoy the company of a lovely flower. Take a hint already.

[charaFace C 0]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
However, this is also something I'm glad about.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
I might look like a child, but since I'm summoned as a Servant, I'll prove to you that I can be useful in battle as well.
[k]


[charaFace C 5]

(Besides, there's something else I want to be sure of.)
[k]

(What made Mash into the lovely flower she is today? Depending on that answer...)
