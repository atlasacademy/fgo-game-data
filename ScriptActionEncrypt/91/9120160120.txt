He never remembers the intervening moments.[sr]He simply wakes up, and there he is.

Then he turns around...

...and there is only hell as far as the eye can see.
[k]

＠
A place so awful it'd feel presumptuous[sr]to call it a battlefield that suits him.
[k]

＠
He figures out who he needs to kill, and quickly focuses his effort on doing so.
[k]

＠
He wastes not a moment,[sr]even if he never knows why he does so.
[k]

＠
But the worst part is...he doesn't even care anymore.
[k]

＠
He leaps into the darkness,[sr]and feels as though he's falling ever deeper into the abyss.
[k]

＠
“Hey, it's not all bad,” he sneers to himself,[sr]“at least I've still got something to lose.”

...It's faint, but there are traces of magecraft being used up ahead.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
And since I don't see any other obvious leads,[sr]I guess we'll just have to head there next.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Come on. It'll be a walk.

...What? You still want to talk?

＠Emiya Alter
I can tell you're the inquisitive type,[sr]but you're better off forgetting about it.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Other Servants have pasts and presents.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
They've got honor, goals, purpose, glory, desires,[sr]dreams, feelings... All that stuff.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I don't have any of that.[sr]I have nothing to give, and nothing to offer.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
...That's the main thing I've got going for me. The cradle of my origin.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
So there's no point in learning about me.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
All you need to know is what I'm capable of.

Is this guy why we're stuck wandering around here...?[sr]Well, I guess it doesn't matter.

Fire up your magical energy, Master.[sr]We're taking him down!
