You're in a bit of a dangerous situation right now...[sr]We have two choices about how to retrieve you.

Our first option would be to conduct a forced Rayshift. It's dangerous, but it's probably the best way to deal with the current situation.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...Let me emphasize that this will be dangerous.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It will be a great deal harder on you than a normal Rayshift.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Second option: I've already pinpointed your coordinates. You should be able to make your way to Mash on foot.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If you do that, we can Rayshift you back normally.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]

However, Mash is a little far. It will take you at least forty-eight hours to reach her.

I don't think betrayal is a concern,[sr]but I'd say death is imminent.

＠Cú Chulainn
In a normal Grail War, a Master only thinks of their Servants as familiars, which causes some trouble.
[k]


＠Cú Chulainn
Most Masters are good-for-nothing mages. It's no wonder they don't get along with Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Well, some Servants tolerate them,[sr]but some Servants cross the line.
[k]


＠Cú Chulainn
But that guy is the opposite. He understands that he's just a familiar, and acts accordingly.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
So that's why if Master's life's in danger...I think he'd throw his life away to protect [&him:her] without hesitating.
[k]


＠Cú Chulainn
It's not something he'd do out of affection so much as just the sort of service he feels is appropriate.
