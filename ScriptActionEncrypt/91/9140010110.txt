？1：What's wrong?

Oh, [%1]. Actually...I was offered a chance for an arranged marriage...
[k]

？1：Uh-huh...Wait, did you say arranged marriage!?

？2：From whom!?

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Medusa
I have two older sisters, and they approached me[sr]about having a formal marriage interview.
[k]

？1：O-Okay...

？2：So who are you meeting?

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Medusa
Well, I don't think they're that serious[sr]about matchmaking.
[k]

＠Medusa
I have a feeling that they're just[sr]interested in my reactions...
[k]

？1：Can't you turn it down?

？2：Let's turn it down!

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Medusa
Sure..., but my sisters gave me a condition[sr]for turning it down...
