Oh, I'm about to go buy some bread at the store.

[charaFace A 1]

At Da Vinci's store?[sr]If you haven't had lunch, why don't we...

I'm going to get to the point.[sr]Why did you ask Karna to run errands for you?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Well, I've been busy, so I just thought...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Using a Heroic Spirit... To buy bread? I'm pretty sure there are other more useful things...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Wait, I meant it as a joke![sr]But he just nodded and walked out of the room...
[k]

？1：Is that right?
？2：And you were okay with that?

？！

＠Karna
Yes, what the Doctor said is correct.[sr]There isn't a single false statement.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Karna
...Did I do something wrong?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

Well, we finally used up all the flour we had.[sr]Dr. Roman also told us not to waste it.

[charaFace E 1]

I got it. Let's use this chance to procure a new supply route!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Da Vinci
Of course you will help me, right? They sell good flour in France, around here.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If you can stuff it into my special Da Vinci Storage Bag,[sr]you should be able to bring back some crops to Chaldea.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Normally, we'd purposely realign Chaldeas to manifest resources from our Rayshift destination but...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Using Chaldea like that would truly deplete our resources... It just doesn't balance out.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So in times like this, we need cheat a little.
