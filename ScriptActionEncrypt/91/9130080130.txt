I was created by Utu and the others as an empty[sr]container intended to become the perfect being.

＠Enkidu
To put it in modern terms, I was like computer hardware that did not yet have any software installed.
[k]

＠Enkidu
And so upon this empty container, Shamhat, Gil, and some other old allies inscribed the traits of humanity. And that is how I came to be as I am.

The path Kingu took is definitely something human[sr]from my perspective, and should be praised.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Per the wish of the individual whom Kingu worshipped as a maternal figure, Kingu was able to live in this world as a new human.
[k]

＠Enkidu
In consequence, he was never a doll used by the[sr]gods, but was instead a human with his own will...
[k]

＠Enkidu
Just like any other human who lived in Sumer.[sr]He managed to become a being with will, instead of a life-form without it.
[k]

＠Enkidu
With that in mind, it is fair to say that[sr]he filled what time was given to him well.
[k]

＠Enkidu
He confronted the goddess whom he worshipped as his mother, using only the emotions he was born with.
[k]

＠Enkidu
To act of my own volition was something I could not do until the very end. While that may have been my fate, Kingu managed to escape it.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Perhaps I should feel jealous. Or perhaps I should[sr]feel relieved that I never held such sentiments.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

I am merely a tool. To live as a human would be to denounce the role I was assigned.

[charaFace A 3]

Thank you. But that may just be a performance.

＠Enkidu
It may just be my programming enabling me to[sr]mimic humans to better interact with them.
[k]

？2：Plenty of humans live their lives like machines.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Enkidu
That may be true. But if those people are satisfied with their life that way, that is the result of feeling hope, which is unique to humans.
[k]

＠Enkidu
If someone feels despair...to be able to feel despair...that is just further proof of being human. That is also an emotion that I cannot experience.
