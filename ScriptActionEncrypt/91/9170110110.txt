＠Mash
[line 2]And the giant king has risen up.
[k]

＠Mash
It's the valiant king of ancient Persia, the last king of the Achaemenid Empire.
[k]

＠Mash
The king who purged the traitor Bagoas, ruled justly, and battled his eternal rival, Iskandar the Conqueror.
[k]

＠Mash
He confronted the world's greatest king of combat, standing in his way as the giant man, a giant wall of infinite valor.
[k]

＠Mash
His name is Darius III. The only person in[sr]the world capable of defeating him is Iskandar.
[k]

＠Darius III

＠Mash
Therefore he was invincible.[sr]He will crush any and all enemy soldiers.

＠Mash
He is utterly invincible![sr]He mows the soldiers down like grass.
[k]

＠Mash
Mighty Darius III.[sr]Valiant Darius III.
[k]

＠Mash
His ferocious onslaught cannot be stopped! Just like[sr]the King of Conquerors he used to fight when he was alive.
[k]

？1：Excuse me, Mash?

？2：What's with all the narration?

He seems perfectly fine without our help.[sr]I wonder why he even came here in the first place.

＠Dr. Roman
I know [%1] had a feeling, that in this era[line 2]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Darius has some business here in the 1st Century Rome,[sr]an era no longer affected by the Grail. But...
[k]

？1：He is a Berserker, after all.

At any rate, we don't know why the skeleton soldiers are here!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But he sure intends to defeat all the monsters here![sr]So he should be satisfied once all of them are defeated.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We'll just have to trust that he won't be angry if we take[sr]some of his prey! All right[line 2]Shall we do this?
