＠Medusa
Uh...My split self's out of magical energy too...
[k]

＠Medusa
Extremely...[sr]Tired...I used all I had...
[k]

＠Medusa
Big Sister doesn't care about[sr]how much magical energy she uses...

＠Stheno
Heheh.[sr]Don't worry, I didn't consume any of mine.
[k]

＠Stheno
But it is really delightful.[sr]My original self doesn't have the strength to fight...
[k]

＠Stheno
But I can fight if materialized as a Servant. A shame[sr]I didn't have this power during the Age of Myths.

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
A-Aah, Senpai!? That's right... You used more[sr]magical energy than you do in usual combat!
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Medusa
Yes. All the magical energy Big Sister used, it should have been all consumed from [%1]...
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Medusa
So, I'm sorry.[sr]I'm really sorry, if you die.

＠Stheno
Wait. I have to tell you before you pass out.[sr]Unfortunately, there is no treasure chest this time.
[k]

＠Stheno
It'd be boring if it was the same every time, right?[sr]I didn't want to disappoint you, but...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Stheno
I found a different treasure.[sr]Sometimes it's good to fight like a tomboy.
[k]

＠Stheno
Well, just like what "Euryale" said.[sr]...I can get used to this, heheh.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Stheno
So, I'll fight with everything I have next time, Master.[sr]Please make a full use of my even more charming Noble Phantasm.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
More important than that, Senpai![sr]Senpai, get a hold of yourself!
[k]

？1：I'm...done...

？2：Sisters...Don't fight... Please...

？！

[charaFace A 14]

Senpai!
