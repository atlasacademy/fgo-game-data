...I am a distinguished general of Rome.
[k]

＠???
I'm the general that conquered Gaul, and made a successful expedition to Britannia.
[k]

＠???
I slaughtered the great general Pompey.[sr]I'm the only ruler of Rome, the origin of its Emperor.
[k]

＠???
I danced within the cruelty of Rome, and also danced in the battlefield.
[k]

＠???
I shall continue fighting.[sr]As long as Rome exists, my dance continues.

So that's why it's leading the United Empire remnants.[sr]In other words, "that" is like Caesar's shadow!

He sensed its presence, and guided you guys all the way here[line 2]!
