Oh, please don't cry out so![sr]It is I, your Kiyohime, Master.

[k]

＠Kiyohime
At any rate, let us walk.[sr]Look, Mash is here as well.

...I can't get in contact with the Doctor.[sr]Anyway, let's take a walk around.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Kiyohime
Yes, you're right. Let's wander around. This too is[sr]one of the delights of travel[line 2]Or so it seems.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Kiyohime
Well, to be honest, I have never taken a real trip.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
When I chased after Lord Anchin, that most certainly could not be called a trip.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Now, then. Shall we begin walking?[sr]I wonder what sort of things await us.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Kiyohime
It sure is a little exciting, isn't it?[sr]Hehehehehe.

＠Kiyohime
Oh, my! Just when I was expecting romance, such a horrid encounter! Dear god! What have I done to deserve this?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
...Oh, right. I do have a vague idea of what it might be.[sr]Most of my behavior in life could be the cause.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Kiyohime
Hmm... I do deserve this. But for this trouble[sr]to be imposed upon my Master simply won't do...
[k]

？1：Our trip has only just begun.

？！

Thank you, Master!
