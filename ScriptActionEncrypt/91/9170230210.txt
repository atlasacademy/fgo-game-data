Once I have chosen a man to be a proper mate for you, you are to set about having children as soon as possible. You will bear children who will carry on the Genji name after we are gone.

Don't be ridiculous. As I told you, you are the Genji's leader, and so are a man. You are, therefore, a father.
[k]

B-but, I can't possibly have a child on my own.[sr]What will I do about my partner...?
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka
[charaTalk A]
He is nothing more than a tool for giving you a child, of course. Once the child is conceived, you are to cut off the father's head.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka
[charaTalk A]
As the leader of the Genji, you will need a minimum of ten heirs, so you will need to cut off ten heads all together; one for each child.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka

I can't imagine you would have sympathy for these men...but if you wish to avert your eyes, you may also use the Four Heavenly Kings to kill them if you like.

He is a monster, just as you are.[sr]A match made in heaven, as they say.

You will mix his inhuman blood[sr]with our powerful Genji blood.
[k]

The resulting child will ensure Genji's dominance over the other clans. Even if we should lose the Settsu armor one day...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka
[charaTalk A]
...the descendant of man, the Sekiryu, and the oni god will be sure to emerge victorious in any battle. Therefore, Raikou, you are to bear Kintoki's child as soon as possible.
[k]

...Yes, Father.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Mitsunaka
[charaTalk A]
To secure the Genji clan's future,[sr]you will need at least ten heirs.

Once you have conceived the tenth,[sr]you are to cut off Kintoki's head.
