It's nothing. All I did was catch everyone off guard. I would never be able to do that a second time. More importantly, my compliments to the head of the Genji. Now that it's over, I'm trembling.

＠Tawara Touta
To realize after the fact that one fought a great demonic insect that would devour even the gods...there's no way one would NOT be scared.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
But that was the last thing on my mind back then. After all, I was blessed by one like a heavenly maiden.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
I was so focused and fired up, I could have risen[sr]to the heavens. Motivation surpassed any fear I had.
