＠Paracelsus
The poisonous girl killed many people. As the name suggests, the girl's veins ran black with poison.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
The girl was searching...for someone who would not[sr]die from her touch, who would smile back at her.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
For someone whom she could lean against...just like she'd seen so many people doing.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
The girl was searching...for love.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
The first one, a man, ended in failure. He died. He spoke sweet nothings to her, but then died as soon as the two kissed.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Paracelsus
But then...the second one...was a young girl.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
One so very powerful that she managed to touch the poisonous girl's skin as if it were nothing...
[k]

＠Paracelsus
...and then smile.

＠Paracelsus
Like I said, it's a parable.[sr]Though, of course, there are elements of truth.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Paracelsus
So the poisonous girl thought to herself, “Ah, this maiden is the one. The one I've desired, the one I've been searching for all this time.”
[k]

＠Paracelsus
She was thrilled.[sr]She worked herself into a fervor.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
The poisonous girl accepted the powerful girl as her master, and entered her service. She killed many, and collected many souls...

[k]

＠Paracelsus
And then she met a young man.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
He was a kind young man. He possessed a noble soul, and he was even concerned with the poisonous girl's safety when she showed herself in battle.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

She did so without mercy, even though[sr]she felt only kindness from him.
[k]


＠Paracelsus
And so, the girl continued to work under[sr]her powerful master, killing more and more.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
Then one day, the poisonous girl[sr]received a gift from a man.

I cannot say. The story's ending is the poisonous girl's alone. It is not for you to know.

At the very least, the girl went into a long slumber, carrying the story's conclusion with her. And she was never to wake up again. Ever.
