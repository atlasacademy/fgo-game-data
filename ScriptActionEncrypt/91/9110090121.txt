＠Mash
The Shadow Servant you faced...[sr]I guess it was a nameless king.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
He neither carved his name in history[sr]nor achieved any noble feats.
[k]

＠Mash
His memory of being a king alone caused him[sr]to wander as a phantom, so to say.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Mordred
Geez, what part of that is so kingly?[sr]Naming yourself king isn't going to make you one.

...Well, whatever.[sr]I got the hang of this after beating up so many ghosts.

Yes. I am not picking up anymore signatures.[sr]It shouldn't manifest itself as a Singularity now.

It's okay to head back now.

Sorry, but I'm gonna go ahead and talk.[sr]I don't care how you respond.

＠Mordred
...So, Master.[sr]Do you think I could be a king?
[k]

？1：I don't know.

？2：I'm not sure.

？！

＠Mordred
...Well, yeah.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Mordred
I thought I was fit to be king.[sr]But[line 2]my father, King Arthur, rejected me.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Mordred
"You don't have what it takes to be a king," he said.
[k]

＠Mordred
Even in death, I couldn't accept that.[sr]I thought that King Arthur loathed me.
[k]

＠Mordred
That he despised his progeny[sr]with his older sister, Morgan, more than anything[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Mordred
Well, that's what I thought.
[k]

＠Mordred
But, since then... So many things happened so quickly[sr]that I gave up trying to be king.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Mordred
Listen up, Master. Since ancient times,[sr]kings have always been egotistical and selfish.
[k]

＠Mordred
They became kings because they wanted something.[sr]Wealth, land, power, sometimes esteem.
[k]

＠Mordred
And then they roped others in, made sweet-talk of[sr]dreams, and strove towards their illusions[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Mordred
But my king was not like that.[sr]He set down his life so that many could smile.
[k]

＠Mordred
...I believe that more than any other king, the will[sr]of the King of Knights was both noble and just.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Mordred
So, there's no way I'm gonna lose[sr]to some guy calling himself the "Mage King."
[k]

＠Mordred
No way.[sr]Absolutely not[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Mordred
...Hey, don't you go telling anyone this, okay?
[k]

＠Mordred
It's embarrassing. So don't you dare bring any of this up[sr]around the other Knights of the Round Table!
[k]

＠Mordred
Okay, no tattling![sr]No tattling whatsoever!
[k]

＠Mordred
See ya!
