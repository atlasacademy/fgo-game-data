＠Sanson
...Whoa.[sr]You seemed to be having a nightmare. What happened?
[k]

？1：The dream, just now...

？！

＠Sanson
Maybe you dreamed about me?[sr]Really, I was just recalling the past now, too.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Sanson
...My life is a repeat of what you saw.[sr]There are no regrets. None obviously.
[k]

＠Sanson
I mean, an executioner wielding a sword with regret[sr]would be something below a packhorse.
[k]

＠Sanson
I send criminals to heaven, without an instant of pain, to enable them to travel freely to their death.
[k]

＠Sanson
Executioners are the blades of the state at all times.[sr]It wouldn't work any other way.
[k]

＠Sanson
This is because the law can be bent at any time.[sr]If it declares a criminal innocent, that's fine too.
[k]

＠Sanson
They merely slipped through a loophole of the law.[sr]As long as nobody gives up, the criminal will still be punished someday.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Sanson
But[line 2]the law punishes the innocent at times.[sr]This was especially prominent in the French Revolution.
[k]

？1：Innocent people were killed?

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Sanson
That's right.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Sanson
...Their crime, if any, was being born.
[k]

＠Sanson
That child died simply because[sr]he served a man that should be executed.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Sanson
Considering that, though there still are loopholes, the fact that the act of punishing the innocent has became rare
[k]

＠Sanson
should be something welcomed.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Sanson
...Oh, sorry.[sr]I apparently disturbed your slumber.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Sanson
I pray that you have sweet dreams.[sr]Well, good night.

...That's right. It's definitely strange here.[sr]It looks like... France, but not the Paris I grew up in.

I can't specify the place. It appears that[sr]I can't communicate with the Doctor either.

We may have been flown off to[sr]another era during the Rayshift.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Let's ask what's going on in the city, first.
[k]

There may be a Singularity, and we may be able to return if we fix that.

Let's move onward, Master.[sr]We just might find something.

No need for excuses.[sr]We shall judge you!

"Thanks for making this easy for me."[sr]I feel like my soul is defiled simply by talking to you.

Permission to fight, Master.[sr]I'll ask these soldiers where the true crime lies.
