Phew... Senpai, are you okay?
[k]

？1：Yep, not even a scratch.
？2：I am, thanks to you, Mash.

？！

＠Mash
Really? I'm glad to hear it.

＠Mash
I'll check the surrounding area to see if there are any enemies left. Senpai, please stay on guard as well.

...Now that you mention it, she does act like a Servant. Probably even more than one...

That's because Mash was raised in Chaldea and duty has always been her priority. So she was well-grounded before all this.

I wouldn't call an aptitude that was forced on her being “well-grounded.” That's called a curse, Archaman.

Oh, please. Tastes can change, but that doesn't change the underlying personality.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
If my adult self is cold-hearted, then so am I. The difference is in whether it's expressed in moderation.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
But it looks like I was being too much of a busybody. Ultimately, what we're able to do doesn't amount to much.

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
So, Master.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
You're the one who's closest to Mash, so please watch out for her.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
How did she fight? What kind of fight was it?[sr]These are important questions, so don't forget.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
That's what I'm trying to say.
[k]

？1：...Got it.
？2：...Thank you.

？！

[charaFace C 1]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
Well, you seem to be a sharp person, Master.[sr]I don't really think I needed to say all that.

It looks like we obliterated the threat, Senpai.

...Um, also, I'd like to say something, just so there's no misunderstanding.

...

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
I don't have anything against wearing a swimsuit in front of you, Senpai.
[k]

＠Mash
But this time around, the swimsuits Gil prepared for me were...just too advanced for my level...
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
If it were a normal swimsuit...and the occasion arose...[sr]I wouldn't mind...
[k]

＠Mash
Th-That's all I wanted to say. Pardon me.

Yes, food for thought. Instead of worrying now, it's like there's promise for the future.

So it looks like you don't need me to stick around. I'll let Master continue to polish this diamond in the rough.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
Ah, but if you ever need a tool to help draw out her girly side, let me know anytime.

I may have just what you need in my treasury!

And where beauty is involved,[sr]don't forget good ol' Da Vinci.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If she seems to be even a little uncertain about her own idea of beauty, don't hesitate to send her my way.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Because nobody surpasses me when it comes to acquiring femininity!

For me, as long as Mash is healthy, I can't ask for anything more...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
But it's a good thing to have a little color in your life! Maybe I'll scrape together some funds to make a swimsuit for Mash!
