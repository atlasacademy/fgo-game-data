＠Mash
Born?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Siegfried
When dragons become as large as Fafnir, they can bear offspring on their own.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Siegfried
Just like these.
[k]

＠Siegfried
Most of them are dead, but even if a few survive[line 2][sr]they'll eventually be surrounded by strong fantasies.
[k]

＠Siegfried
Then new Evil Dragons will be born.
[k]

＠Siegfried
It's because of that fear, we humans desperately fought the dragons.
[k]

？1：Weren't you afraid?

？2：You're brave.

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Siegfried
I appreciate that, Master.[sr]Unfortunately, I was afraid.
[k]

＠Siegfried
I only killed the dragon because I was asked to.[sr]I suppose I'm the type who[line 2]just can't refuse a request.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Siegfried
To all warriors, the title Dragon Slayer was an eternal[sr]honor. ...I won't deny that I was motivated by fame.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Siegfried
But, it was so scary I regretted it immediately.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
You still ended up victorious, right?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Siegfried
Yes, but as I said before, even I don't know how I won.
[k]

＠Siegfried
When I came to, there was the bloody dragon and[sr]my bloodstained self. Its lair was dyed red.
[k]

＠Siegfried
My skin which should have been badly burned was[sr]hardly hurt. ...It was strange, but I knew I had won.
[k]

？1：Were you happy?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Siegfried
Of course. The dragon was slain and I thought I[sr]could devote my entire life to realizing that.
[k]

？2：Was it fun?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Siegfried
...Yes, it was fun.[sr]The moment I realized it, I gave an uncharacteristic shout.
[k]

？！

＠Siegfried
The treasure I gained eventually cast me into misfortune,[sr]but... I have no regrets or hesitations.
[k]

＠Siegfried
I know it's not the most enlightened way to put it,[sr]but I accepted the circumstances of my life.
[k]

＠Siegfried
I grant someone's wish.[sr]I accept their joy, their sadness, and their rage.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Siegfried
...And that was enough to give my life fulfillment.[sr]Except[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Siegfried
!!![sr]It seems our idle chatter is at an end.
[k]

＠Siegfried
I've located it[line 2][sr]Which means it's located me, as well.
