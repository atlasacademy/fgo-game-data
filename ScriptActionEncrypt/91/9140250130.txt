Welcome...to the Chaldean League of Villains.
[k]

？1：Yeeeah, I don't think I'm gonna be turning them down for you.
？2：This seems like a mistake to you, huh?

So that is your initial reaction, is it? I certainly accounted for that in my calculations, but I must say it is still somehow surprising.

Heeheeheehee! You wound me, you wound me! All we wanted was a new playmate we were sure to get along with!

Dammit! As if I'd ever join any pirate club who'd have the old hag as a member!

Still, I has a sad since I won't get to see the holy zone extending from Mary's pert upper arm to down below her armpit on a daily basis!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Blackbeard
Anyway, I decided to hang out here until Bartholomew and the others show up.
[k]

＠Blackbeard
Gotta make sure he doesn't soak in that lukewarm bath for so long that he forgets how to commit a proper crime, after all.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]

＠Blackbeard
The only downside is that my tastes are just not compatible with these plebs here!
[k]


＠Blackbeard
How can you all be so disinterested in my secret collection!? It's the stuff every man dreams about!

I-I don't know what you're talking about, but nobody should be committing any kind of crime!

Now, now, just a moment. I believe there's been some sort of misunderstanding.

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
We haven't actually formed a secret society sworn to foment chaos and anarchy.
[k]


＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
We are merely exercising a bit of...fantasy.

Everyone has a dream they bask in from time to time, do they not? Things they know to be improbable or infeasible, yet cannot help but yearn for nonetheless.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
We come here to share those dreams, to imagine what it would take to make them come true as a sort of mental exercise, nothing more.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
It's a surprisingly effective form of stress relief. Even we villains need a safe space where we can relax and be ourselves, after all.

Really makes it hard to girl watch in the cafeteria. I can't even remember the last time I grabbed a cup of tea there.
[k]

＠Blackbeard
The best I've managed is to rig the soda machine to serve only the Blackbeard Special (coffee mixed with orange juice)...

Personally, I'm so used to people pretending not to see me that it's a bit of a thrill when they do.

＠Mephistopheles
Heehee, heeheehee! Go on, look at me! No, on second thought, please don't! No, wait, on third thought, please do!
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
What's that? You want to look at me even more?[sr]You can't take your eyes off me for a moment?
[k]

＠Mephistopheles
In that case, why don't I hold on to your eyes for you? That way, they'll never come off me!

Mephy there may be too Chaotic Evil for me to account for him in my calculations, but he's welcome here nonetheless. Diversity is crucial to the health of any organization, after all.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
I've sent out an invite to Henry[line 2]er, Edward as well, but I'm afraid he has yet to respond.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
He may have just thrown it away, or some busybody may have torn it up before he even saw it. I tell you, it's too much for this aging man's heart!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
At any rate, that is the sort of broad-minded play land we are attempting to build here. Join us, and let us all enjoy ourselves together.

I know what you're getting at. You're talking about what happened after my big voyage, right? But everything I did was completely normal.
[k]

＠Columbus
And I do mean everything.
[k]

＠Columbus
If I thought it was okay to do something, I did it.[sr]If I thought it was wrong, then I didn't.
[k]

＠Columbus
I made my men do what I thought was okay,[sr]and punished them if they did something bad.
[k]

＠Columbus
That's all there was to it. I never bothered thinking about whether our actions were good or evil.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Columbus
No, that's not quite right. I didn't bother bringing along anything to measure what's good and what's evil.
[k]

＠Columbus
Getting ready for the voyage out west was hard enough without packing things we didn't need.

[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
Yes, I can certainly understand that.[sr]So that's why you don't think of yourself as evil.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
However, I feel your explanation is[sr]lacking in one particular respect.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
And whether this is an intentional or accidental omission is of particular relevance.

Very well then, I'll get straight to the point. Unlike a certain “great” detective I could name, I have no interest in beating around the bush.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
You were very clear that as of this moment, you do not think of the person you are now as a villain.
[k]

＠D：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
So then, the obvious question is: As of right now,[sr]how do you see the man you were in the past?

It would be a shame to let you go.[sr]Are you sure you won't reconsider joining us?

I could always use a new crew member.[sr]Especially a skilled sailor with similar tastes!

After all, you never know when someone's gonna challenge you to a duel you can't talk your way out of, smh. I plan on being the last one standing!

So get over here and show us what you're really made of already! Got regrets about how you lived your life? Save them for your deathbed!
