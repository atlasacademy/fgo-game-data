It's pretty standard for a dragon to guard treasure, but I didn't expect the Templars to use one.

They're less like Templars and more like Temp-LATES, am I right?

Anyway, this is a huge pile of treasure, Master.[sr]Yeah, I like it.

There's enough money here to easily buy a country or two. Any Grails?

Nope, I'm not picking up anything. But I do see magical energy here and there in the treasure.

Probably used by the Templars. Magically it's nothing special, but it's valuable as a treasure.

The right thing to do would be to return these to the Templars' followers, but we're pirates, so we'll just keep it, thank you very much.

＠Anne
Hehehe, this is also for saving the world.
[k]

＠Mary
Yup! Let's make good use of this to save the world. Right, Master?
