...Yes, this is the end.[sr]This is checkmate for the king.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
Of course, in this case I'd perish too, but that can't[sr]be helped. Though virtual, I think it's good enough.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jing Ke
After all, this is nothing more than a fabrication.[sr]The fact remains that I failed to assassinate the first emperor.

＠Jing Ke
But if I sacrifice my body, certainly[sr]I will be of some use to you.
[k]

？1：I don't want you to die.

？2：Don't waste your life.

？！

＠Jing Ke
...Ah, you're right.[sr]I will gratefully accept your kindness.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jing Ke
But unfortunately, this is the only way I know how to[sr]fight. And this is the reason I was summoned.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jing Ke
You must use me.[sr]And when I vanish completely, lament for me.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
Your tears are my everything.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
That way, I would be able to think that[sr]my sacrifice had served a purpose.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jing Ke
...Don't worry.[sr]That doesn't mean it will happen.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jing Ke
Until then, I'll enjoy this world with drink in hand.
