＠Spartacus
Master! Ye who's not an oppressor,[sr]but destined to become an oppressor one day.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Spartacus
Yes. I see that you're confused.[sr]I understand, we're inside the camp of a Roman army.
[k]

＠Spartacus
And at this moment, we're going to show them our strengths. So it seems that I cannot avoid my destiny for battle.
[k]

？1：What's going on?

？2：Where is this place?

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Spartacus
Not to worry.[sr]We both share the same destiny.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Spartacus
Although if you do end up being an oppressor,[sr]I'll have no choice but to cut down your head[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Spartacus
Perhaps, I should've cut you down the day you became[sr]my "Master." But for now... I shall accompany you.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Spartacus
Or, maybe... No, as long as you're a "Master"[sr]there's no use. It's sad, but that's destiny.
[k]

？1：What happened?

？2：Please listen to me.

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Spartacus
It is time now for battle and bloodshed. The road forward from here will be a living hell. Yes, my blood will seethe.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Spartacus
And my muscles, organs, skin, and all that I am will tremble with delight!

Um... Master, Master.[sr]I don't want to bother you when you look so confused.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
[line 2]And I know this is sudden.[sr]But it looks like we're captured.
[k]

？1：Why?

？2：How come?

？！

All I know is that we were already like this when I woke up. See? Even Fou has cute little shackles on.

And what's making this even worse,[sr]Spartacus is really in the mood for a fight...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Rather than think our way out of this,[sr]it might be better for us to fight.

＠Spartacus
It is over, sad and fragile.[sr]And no one would sing of their praises.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Spartacus
They stood before us, without a shred of fear in their body, they charged at us.
[k]

＠Spartacus
Now that's courage. A great and might conviction,[sr]something an oppressor will never have.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Spartacus
Hail them! Hail these warriors![sr]Not me, but them!

A-A lion?[sr]Master, your orders! This could be a real fight[line 2]!

[charaFace A 8]

[line 2]Or maybe not.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Now that I think about it, Spartacus was[sr]always renown for being a great gladiator.
[k]

＠Mash
On this kind of battlefield, he can handle this all alone without a problem.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Spartacus
[line 2]This stench! It reeks! This is the[sr]stench of impatience. Mixed with the stench of rage.
[k]

＠Spartacus
It's the stench of animosity, that they will not let us[sr]return alive. In that case, I am already prepared!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Spartacus
Monsters! Bring out the monsters that[sr]you people sealed away with your oppression!
[k]

＠Spartacus
That is their way to becoming free![sr]For as long as our interests conflict, I will crush them!
[k]

＠Spartacus
Yet, when all has ended, I shall weep! I will take[sr]their hands, and shed tears of blood for their destiny.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
