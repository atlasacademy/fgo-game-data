I hear there are dragons on this island.[sr]Naturally, we shall go on a hunting trip. Now prepare yourselves, mongrels.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
O-Of course. But my King, some regions revere dragons as gods, so wouldn't we be cursed or suffer divine punishment for troubling what could be a local deity?

It won't work, Mash. Saying that kind of stuff will only get him more pumped up.

Indeed, those who would dare cower themselves before the gods shall be punished my hands.

Yeah. Talk about unexpected.

＠Dr. Roman
I'm not sure if it's because [%1] can get along with everyone, or Gilgamesh is just more reasonable than we believed.

Either way, both of them are in perfect sync.[sr]Even if it's just a momentary miracle!

Foolish girl, we are going to hunt down dragons! Then it is only natural to encounter monsters in a forest...

[charaFace D 3]
＠Gilgamesh
...or perhaps monsters in a cave, or even more powerful monsters in the depth of that cave!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

And that is what makes any adventure a tale worth telling for! Do not be mistaken about that!
