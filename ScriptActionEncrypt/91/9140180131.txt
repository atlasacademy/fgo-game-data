I have targeted your arm now. Time to surrender. I regret to inform you that victory is now quite beyond your reach as matters stand.

[charaFace B 7]

＠Quetzalcoatl
...Do you know why there are so many flashy moves in Lucha Libre?
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
No...I cannot say I have given it any thought. They are likely just inefficient skills meant for nothing so much as pure showmanship.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Quetzalcoatl
No! They are for the audience, and for your opponent, with whom you share a deep mutual trust!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
If you are seeking efficiency in battle,[sr]then you should head to war!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
A battle without cheers or lights...a battlefield that is utterly lonely!
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
Cheers? Do those really matter for battle?

[charaFace B 2]

Of course![sr]That's why, Master, I ask you to cheer for me!

＠Quetzalcoatl
Yes. You were spared because you tapped so early.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
You should be grateful that I am so precise in executing my moves, yes. For any other wrestler, we were beyond the point of no return!
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
Probably. I'm surprised I lived. I'm actually more frightened that you have the muscles to stop that move than the muscles needed to do it in the first place.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Of course. I told you. Luchadoras perform their moves with utmost consideration for their partners!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Stopping a move midway through is just common courtesy. But I suspect you could have fought more!
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
I had every intention of doing so. The spirit is willing, but the body...not so much.
[k]
？1：What do you mean?

？！

＠Mask de Baritsu
The move was surreal. It was so intense, but at the same time, my heart was pounding with excitement.
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
Excited that the move was terrible...and intriguing at the same time. The moment I had that thought, my body tapped out quite of its own accord.
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
I have the confidence to meet any malevolent attack directly, but it appears my self-defense skills cannot handle moves made with kind intentions.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Heehee. You speak too highly of it.[sr]I just didn't have the strength to make it hurt.
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
I withdraw what I said about your moves being just for show. It reminds me of a Japanese sword form called kassatsuken, where one imbues their sword with life and death for their battle.
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
One permits their opponent to live, even after defeating them. I had always found this contradictory, but...I understand now.
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
Strength is not simply a matter of defeating your opponent.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Yes, your moves were also very strong, Baritsu Mask. But you seem to be very fragile. You need to eat better so your bones will be sturdy, yes!
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
I'll take your word for it.
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
...Your technique is a sort I would never employ, but I would still like to show my respect to you, who has so mastered lucha.
[k]

＠Mask de Baritsu
Adiós, Miss Quetzalcoatl. Should we have the opportunity, I would like to meet again.

I have that pleasant sort of fatigue you get after hard work! Also the satisfaction that I was able to express myself to and understand others through lucha!
