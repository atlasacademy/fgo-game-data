＠Mata Hari
So this is the place that'll have clues for the investigation?
[k]

＠Mash
Yes. And we'd like to ask you,[sr]Mata Hari, to carry out the investigation.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Mata Hari
Oh, you're wise with your decision.[sr]I'll definitely get it done.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Mata Hari
But, Master. Unfortunately, I won't[sr]be able to get anywhere by myself.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Mata Hari
So, please be sure[sr]to protect me, hehe.
[k]

？1：Of course.

？2：I'll do my best.

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Mata Hari
I'm counting on you.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Please, we'll leave the investigation to you.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Mata Hari
Right, of course.[sr]Please hold on a second.

Once I enter the tavern, please wait until evening.[sr]I'm sure there'll be a raid.

Y-Yes.[sr]I got it.

Huh?[sr]Oh, well...Who are you?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Mata Hari
A traveling performer.[sr]You're a local, right?
[k]

＠Citizen
Yeah, I was born and raised here.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Mata Hari
Then, can you tell me about this town?[sr]I want to make a living here for a while.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Mata Hari
If so, I'll have to know my way[sr]around the town, right?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Mata Hari
Of course, I'll buy you a drink.[sr]That is, if you know a good place.
[k]

＠Citizen
Oh, of course.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Mata Hari
Then, let's go.[sr]Hehehe, maybe it's not healthy to drink during the day.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Mata Hari
But, it's fun not being healthy.[sr]...Wouldn't you agree?
[k]

＠Citizen
Oh...Oh yeah, sure![sr]Then, let's go drink!

...Brilliant technique. A man perceived as single[sr]and in his early thirties instantly fell for it.
[k]

Despite wearing such revealing dress, she doesn't feel unnatural at all.

A-As expected of a legendary spy who made men of French, English, and Russian governments fall for her...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
If she wants to, she can pleasure...[sr]I mean, make the entire town fall for her.

Anyway, let's follow her and wait until nightfall.
[k]

＠Mash
Mata Hari is good at espionage but poor at fighting, so we have to support her.

Ahahaha, this is so much fun.[sr]What happened to you?
[k]

＠Mata Hari
Still haven't had enough to drink?[sr]Or is there something else you rather do?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Mata Hari
I guess it's true when men drink too much, they lose their performance.
[k]

＠Citizen
...Who are you?[sr]You are not just any traveling entertainer.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Mata Hari
Well, who am I? That aside,[sr]can you call out the soldiers you've been hiding?
