Hold it. I understand how you feel, but calm down, mongrel. There's no need to rush in like fools.

He's a Caster. Unlike the Assassin we encountered, he will be easy to track.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
However, we should try to discern their intent before we do anything.
[k]

？1：...Does he want to separate us from something?

[charaFace C 1]

Correct.[sr]See, you can do it if you try.

...Unbelievable... So this is the level of idiocy I should expect from today's youth...

Think, mongrel. He is trying to lure us to follow him, so what is the one thing he would not want us to do?

？！

His retreat is an obvious diversion. Don't you think there is somewhere else we should be searching?
