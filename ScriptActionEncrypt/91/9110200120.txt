＠Lancelot
I know this is rather obvious, but this place is very different from the Britain I remember.
[k]

？1：Mordred didn't seem to mind.

＠Lancelot
Well, that is Mordred. She was never the most refined among us, and could be downright uncouth about things like this.
[k]


＠Lancelot
I can only imagine she was barking like a dog,[sr]trying to scare others out of her territory.
[k]

？2：Well, yeah. It's been about a thousand years.

＠Lancelot
I see humanity has come a long way to be able to build so many structures of this sort in this benighted land.
[k]


＠Lancelot
I understand progress is progress,[sr]but it is still somewhat jarring.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠Lancelot
Yes, this place was in constant strife. It had no chance to thrive, being ever ablaze in the fires of war.
[k]

＠Lancelot
The people of this land...they put all their hope in the King of Knights.
[k]

＠Lancelot
They all believed that the one chosen by the sacred sword would be able to save the world.

And yet, ultimately,[sr]Britain's fate was destruction.

The best you could do was try to mitigate the damage for future generations.

Now that I reflect back, that is probably true.
[k]

＠Lancelot
They should have simply given up and accepted their destruction in peace.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Lancelot
That is my opinion as I look back on it now, playwright.
[k]

＠Lancelot
But for those who lived during that time...the knights who lived in that era...well, there was no way any of them could accept such a thing.

And that is why we fight now to prevent our own destruction!

[charaFace B 2]

It would, I suppose, be fair to say that I am simply watching, cheering, and writing.

Were he a warrior, I would have him account for his words with his weapon... That would resolve so many things so very easily...

Had I been summoned in a normal Holy Grail War, it is Master who would have been doing most of the fighting.

Yes.[sr]My job is to wave a flag around to cheer you on.

I'm relieved, then, that you're not involved in a normal Holy Grail War, Master...
[k]

＠Lancelot
Doubly so, knowing that had you been in such a situation, Shakespeare might have been your Servant.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Lancelot
But then again, I wonder what kind of Holy Grail War he would be summoned to?
[k]

＠Lancelot
...Would they make him write a new book or something?

So sense my intentions, conform to my will, and obey my words. That is what it means to be loyal.

My methods and actions may have been mistaken, but I still believe my intentions were true and just.

＠Lancelot
At times, true loyalty may require a knight to bare steel against his lord.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Lancelot
This rings all the truer when I face one who calls herself the embodiment of destruction! I can justly say that a person like you is no lord of mine!
[k]

＠Lancelot
If you are the Wild Hunt, the King of the Storm, I am...

＠Lancelot
The Knight of the Lake, who faces the storm down with his silent blade.
