Especially when I think of the time when the SPR called me a fraud.

＠Paracelsus
You are right.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
It is not unusual for each mage to have their own unique usage of odd words and phrases.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
For example, I use terms like “prima materia,” “transmutation product,” and “quinta essentia.”
[k]

＠Paracelsus
In the world of alchemy, especially during my time, these words were not unique...
[k]

＠Paracelsus
...but not all mages use them. Come to think of it, I believe the first founders of the Clock Tower likely used different terms.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
That's why this is probably the same for her.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
First off, there is no doubting her genius. Such people are generally misunderstood by the common masses.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
The Mahatma that she speaks of...and what that means...
[k]

＠Paracelsus
In order to truly understand, one would need to be on the same level as her.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Paracelsus
Oh, and by the way, Master...
[k]

＠Paracelsus
Apropos of nothing, I just happened to prepare an elixir...
[k]

＠Paracelsus
It temporarily strengthens the limbic system, the cerebral nerves, and even magical circuits.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
Would you like a sip?
[k]

？1：No thank you.
？2：Nope! (Nope!)

？！

Theosophy, was it? If that magecraft is what its name suggests, it must be a study of godly wisdom.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Medea
It must be something that didn't originate in the Age of Gods, so I don't expect anything grandiose...

My magecraft was given to me by Hekate.[sr]Calling them similar is probably off the mark.

The Mahatma and Hierarchy that I have been sensing until today...
[k]

＠Helena
I am not sure whether they are the same beings as the gods of the Age of Gods.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Helena
I personally believe that true Mahatmas are the supernatural beings who have reached the Swirl of the Root, or at least have come in contact with the Root.
[k]

＠Helena
Whether it would be appropriate to call them gods is something that I honestly cannot determine.

Hekate. The Goddess Hekate...

Possessing Authority over the earth, the sea, and the sky, who offered many blessings to those who prayed to her...
