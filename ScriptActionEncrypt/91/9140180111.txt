＠Holmes
This has turned into quite the intense brawl.[sr]Miss Martha seems to have landed more punches.
[k]

＠Holmes
And they are no mere jabs. Any ordinary[sr]Servant would have gone down in short order.
[k]

＠Holmes
One might say that while she has a rather slender Spirit Origin, she hides the power of a freight train in those arms of hers.
[k]

＠Holmes
And what stamina! Even the rhythm of her breathing sounds like the roaring of a dynamo!
[k]

？1：But Quetzalcoatl isn't backing down either.

？！

＠Holmes
Right you are. Ah, take a look.[sr]Miss Martha is finally getting in position.

＠Holmes
That stance... She's readying the fist of justice, inverted thrust...Jacob's Perishing Fist.
[k]

？1：Jacob's Perishing Fist!?
？2：What are you talking about, Holmes!?

？！

＠Holmes
Quiet. The real battle starts now.[sr]It would be a shame to miss even a single second!
[k]

＠Holmes
The Jacob's Limbs style is said to be able to defeat even an archangel. It's specialized for use against a target with Divinity...like Quetzalcoatl.
[k]

＠Holmes
And behold that stance, [%1]. She's putting everything into that strike, and so leaving herself wide open!
[k]

＠Holmes
Should it hit head-on, there will be consequences.[sr]For both parties, that is.

It's an evasive maneuver. The instant that fist touches her face, she turns her head to avoid injury.
[k]

＠Holmes
Of course, it's easier said than done, and it's not something just anyone can do. But, she's managed to pull of that miraculous feat!

＠Martha
O Jacob, O Moses...I'm terribly sorry.[sr]I have suffered utter defeat...
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Martha, you were a wonderful opponent. Especially that last puñetazo...I thought I was going to pass out.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
I'm sure you wouldn't have stopped even if I kicked your stomach.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
You forced me to use the llave that I had originally sealed off.
[k]

＠Martha
I never imagined you wouldn't try to evade my fist. I'm not making excuses for myself, but I flinched a little.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Quetzalcoatl
And that was the reason for your defeat![sr]A luchadora does not even think of evading!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
A lucha match is all about lifting the opponent up. That's why I took your hit. You just didn't know that.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Quetzalcoatl
If you had known, you would have continued into a clinch hold, yes?
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Had that happened, I don't know[sr]how the match would have gone.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Martha
...I see.[sr]Way to go. You completely defeated me.
[k]

＠Martha
We may be from different worlds, but it's clear to me that you are a divine spirit of good. I've not a single ounce of resentment towards you.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Martha
Let's fight in a proper ring next time.[sr]I shall study up on lucha a bit more until then.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Quetzalcoatl
¡De nada![sr]I shall look forward to that time, yes!
