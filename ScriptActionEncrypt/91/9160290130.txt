Just wh-what do you want with me!? Fine, I confess![sr]I have been terrified of snakes since I was a child!
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chiyome
But so what!? What would you know of the pain and suffering that comes from being born with the curse of Orochi!?
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Chiyome
How could you possibly know what it is like to be burdened with the knowledge that you will one day grow scales and become a serpent!?

＠Chiyome
Or worse, perhaps that fate will not fall to me, but to my child, or my grandchild, or my distant descendant...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chiyome
But regardless of who is made to endure that fate, it is one that all of Orochi's shrine maidens born to the Mochizuki clan must bear!

＠Chiyome
Even in death, in this new, transient life as a shadow, my curse has not been lifted...

I have finally found a master that does not see shinobi as disposable pawns, but treats me with kindness and respect!

[charaFace B 2]
＠Chiyome
I can hardly fathom my fortune in meeting [&him:her]![sr]I can never hope to adequately pay [&him:her] back!

No! As far as I am concerned, you are no oni of Mt. Ooe! You are nothing less than the child of the great serpent god responsible for my curse!

[charaFace B 4]
＠Chiyome
I know that the ancient serpent, or perhaps dragon,[sr]known as Yamata-no-Orochi, was once worshipped as Ibuki Daimyojin...[wt 0.5][charaFace B 5]and that he had a single child to his name!
