＠Jeanne Alter
[line 3]Tsk, I wondered why "I was here" suddenly.[sr]So this is why.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
How truly upsetting. What is this?[sr]More of that nightmare?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Whose idea was it to drag out a fake who's already been defeated once?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Was it that Master there? Or that girl?[sr]No, that's not right.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Only a Heroic Spirit as tainted as me could come up with a bad idea like this.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Jeanne Alter
Am I wrong?[sr]You, Britain's tainted King of Knights?

[line 3]You're talkative.[sr]Did Jeanne d'Arc talk a lot as well?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Saber Alter
No, I'm sure she did.[sr]She was happy to be called the Maiden of Orleans.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
I'm sure she liked to talk.[sr]What can I say, she had the mind of a peasant.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
[line 6]Huh? What's your problem?[sr]Are all Britons idiots?

Of course.[sr]We're here to defeat this woman.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Saber Alter
[%1], you are an inexperienced Master.[sr]Fight stronger, more terrifying foes and polish your skills.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
Oh, so that's it. The kind King of Knights[sr]has prepared a trial for that Master.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Very well, I accept. But be careful,[sr]I'm vulgar and very violent[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Jeanne Alter
And after what you did to me last time, I'm ready to rip your head from your neck!

A splendid yell, flag-bearer.[sr]I'm glad I chose you as an opponent.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
What? Trying to be a friendly? Disgusting! You think[sr]we can be best friends just because we're both evil?
[k]

＠Saber Alter
No, I simply chose a worthy opponent to crush.[sr]I've no emotional attachments towards you.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Saber Alter
But I will say one thing...
[k]

＠Saber Alter
Shadow of Jeanne d'Arc, born of the Grail,[sr]you said we were both tainted beyond measure[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Saber Alter
But from where I stand, you are far more tainted than me.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Jeanne Alter
Hehe[line 3]That's my line, mere clone of that coward King Vortigern!
