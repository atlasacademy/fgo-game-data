＠Emiya Alter
Well that was a waste of time. Come on, let's hurry.

？1：You know, I've been wondering for a while now[line 2]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Emiya Alter
Whatever it is, I'm not interested unless[sr]it has to do with my capabilities.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Emiya Alter
...[sr]...
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
That said, the fact that you still[sr]have energy for idle chatter is good.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
If there's something you wanna ask me on the way,[sr]go ahead. If I feel like it, I'll answer.

＠Emiya Alter
If you're wondering what I am, [bgm BGM_EVENT_41 0.1]that's hard to explain.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
As a Master, you ought to know that[sr]every hero has another side to them.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Emiya Alter
Some of them, they slaughter innocent people without so much as blinking. Others, they fight to protect their country like their lives depended on it.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Most of those types that everyone looks up to have some sort of hidden cruel side.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Emiya Alter
Then you have Servants, which reflect[sr]only one side of the hero they represent.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Sometimes, a Servant'll reflect[sr]that hero's hidden side...
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
...and sometimes, their Spirit Origin'll end up corrupted for one reason or another.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Servants like that all get lumped[sr]into a different category.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
We're talking the possible destruction of all of humanity here. We need all the help we can get, and we can't be choosy about whether we get it from good or bad people.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Emiya Alter
...But even there, I'm an unusual case.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
The other me was a nameless hero,[sr]shaped by society at large.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Emiya Alter
It might've been a one-of-a-kind event,[sr]but it still happened naturally.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Emiya Alter
But me, I'm not one of a kind. I'm just twisted.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
The past that made me a hero is gone, and I don't remember anything about who I used to be.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
All that's left now is my ability to kill my enemies.[sr]That's the only reason I materialized.
[k]

？1：Is that why you spend most of your time in your spirit form?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Emiya Alter
Yeah.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
The others try to find meaning in existence, but since I'm just a weapon, I don't bother with anything outside of a fight.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
After all, no one should go waving weapons around when there's no battles to be fought, right?
[k]

？2：Then, your memories[line 2]

＠Emiya Alter
I know in my head that the other[sr]guy is who I used to be.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
But it doesn't feel real. It's like we've been separated into two completely different people.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Emiya Alter
Anyway, enough prattling. Come on, Master.
