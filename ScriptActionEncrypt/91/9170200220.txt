？1：You've been poisoned!

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Tch... So that's what their game was.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Don't worry about it. I might not be long for this world, but I'm not done for yet.
[k]

？2：I'll heal you!

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Don't bother.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Semiramis made this...and she's been[sr]poisoning people longer than anyone.
[k]


＠Cú Chulainn Alter
A few cure spells aren't gonna do shit.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]


＠Cú Chulainn Alter
So, five to go... Better take care of them before the poison spreads too far.

Still no sign of what time period this is, or a place where we can get a look at this whole Singularity.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Ah well, that's not important.[sr]The main thing is finding the other Servants.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...What? You still worried about[sr]the poison or something?
[k]

？1：That's part of it, but...

[charaFace A 5]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Yeah?
[k]

？！

？1：It's just, you have so little regard for yourself...

[charaFace A 4]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...You haven't changed a bit, have you?
[k]

？2：I don't get you.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
You don't have to get me. Servants are just machines.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
And there's no point in caring for[sr]a machine like it was a person.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...Getting back to what matters here...
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
There's definitely something odd about this Singularity. Some parts look like the Far East, others like South America.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
And on top of that, I don't see any signs of people anywhere. We can't just keep stumbling around and hope for the best.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Any bright ideas, Master?
[k]

？1：Maybe we could find somewhere to go if we made a boat?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
...Forget it. Every bone in my body's[sr]telling me that's a bad idea.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
I'm guessing we could sail all the way around this world and still not find anywhere to go.
[k]

？2：Maybe a cave or something...?

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
Yeah, that makes sense.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn Alter
It'd be a good idea to find shelter in a cave,[sr]in part so you can get some rest.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn Alter
All right, let's see if we can find a cave.[sr]But first...

No, wait, I totally know how I feel! This is just as exciting now as it was back then! I can't wait to back you into a corner and finish you off!

You have narrowed your focus so much that you've blinded yourself to anything other than your goal.

[charaFace E 5]

But remember this, warrior of Ulster: that very part of you is what weighs on your Master the most.
