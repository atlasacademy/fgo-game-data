＠Nero Bride
So this is the place where the so-called Greater Grail was. Hm... I knew it. This spot would make an ideal forge.
[k]

＠Nero Bride
Now then, [%1].[sr]I brought you here for a reason.
[k]

＠Nero Bride
As we have grown quite accustomed to each other,[sr]I'm considering taking our contract to the next step.
[k]

＠Nero Bride
To be specific, we're here to increase my strength. Now, I am well aware that you have no complaints about me.
[k]

＠Nero Bride
I know I am a dependable Servant. Or, more accurately, the number one, most trustworthy Servant!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Nero Bride
But...you know... Well... That's not enough for me.[sr]I want you to rely on me even more!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Nero Bride
So, to make that wish a reality, I've created a situation where I am indispensable!
[k]

？1：Um...?

[charaFace A 2]
＠Nero Bride
Don't you understand!? I am going to be the ultimate Servant under your command!
[k]

＠Nero Bride
That's right! I hereby declare it!
[k]

？2：You're already indispensable, Nero.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Nero Bride
Umu! I knew it. I knew it![sr]Why you, stating the obvious! Yooou!
[k]

？！

＠Nero Bride
...Oops. This isn't the best place to raise one's voice.
[k]

＠Nero Bride
To business, then![sr]Our task today is to strengthen my sword.
[k]

＠Nero Bride
My sword is beautiful and excellent, but unlike many other Heroic Spirits' weapons, mine has no specific legend of its own.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Nero Bride
...Umu. This is just between you and me.
[k]

＠Nero Bride
I actually made this sword myself, by hand. That on its own makes it a most desirable weapon, but it doesn't make it very powerful.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Nero Bride
So, I've decided to reforge it, here on a new leyline! This iron meteorite is a spiritual stone that fell to Earth in the distant past.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Nero Bride
What did Simon call them... Tears of the stars?[sr]Things not of this world...
[k]

＠Nero Bride
...Fragments of hope that even the stars themselves could not know? ...Something like that. [charaFace A 0]No matter.
[k]

＠Nero Bride
We shall place it on the powerful leyline in the heart of this cavern, stoke it with fire, and infuse it with life.
[k]

＠Nero Bride
...There's just one problem.[sr]I am sure I need not even say it, but...

＠Nero Bride
Well, as you can see, this cavern is a den of wicked beasts! [charaFace A 0]While I am strengthening my sword, I want you to protect me.
[k]

？1：Leave it to me.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Nero Bride
Umu, I'm counting on you, Master!

[charaFace A 3]
＠Nero Bride
Urgh. Don't give me those abandoned puppy dog eyes.[sr]I want to fight with you as well!
[k]


[charaFace A 0]
＠Nero Bride
But the task of reforging this sword must be mine alone. I must refrain from battling alongside you.

They're here. I leave the rest to you![sr]Don't worry. I'm a genius. I can finish it up in a day!
[k]

＠Nero Bride
Commit yourself to a full day's worth of battle for me, without rest or sleep!
