Indeed.

You became a Servant,[sr]and I became a ghost.

＠Victor
But all the changes taking place in the world...[sr]It seems they have created the perfect environment for me.

＠Victor
I am but a ghost. A remnant of the past.[sr]I am nothing more, and yet[line 2]

＠Victor
With a strong enough will, I can do it again.[sr]I can start over.

If you do, you can take her place[line 2][sr]and become a new legend.
