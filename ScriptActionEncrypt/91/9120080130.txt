Well, it's not exactly a Singularity. It would hardly show up as even a tiny stain on the tapestry of history.

It's more like a little piece of lint. Even the faintest breeze would blow it off of the fabric of history.

＠Da Vinci
It means that Tristan is in the most dire of all situations because he's in a place that could disappear at any moment.
