＠Kiyohime
Ahh, such a magnificent view.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Oh, yes.[sr]...About that trip.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Kiyohime
The only thing that I saw was his back. That dreamy[sr]back. He abandoned me and simply ran away[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Kiyohime
...But just so you know.[sr]I did think back on my actions.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Kiyohime
Yet, still, even so.[sr]Why didn't he utter a single word of apology.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
If he can not do that, he could at least yell at me[line 2]
[k]

？1：That would be tough.

？2：That's never happening.

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Kiyohime
But why? I am not the type that[sr]would slit her wrists at the slightest reproach.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Kiyohime
However, my chat-room friend, Tamamo, told me,
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Kiyohime
"You know, your understanding of why[sr]Anchin left you is wrong at the most basic level."
[k]

＠Kiyohime
"He didn't want to stay away from you, in fact, he liked you a little, just a little."
[k]

＠Kiyohime
"However, your love for someone who only liked you[sr]a little is too heavy. Too much is as bad as too little."
[k]

＠Kiyohime
"With you it's either love or hate, one or zero.[sr]You really need to change your digital way of thinking!"
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Kiyohime
That is her opinion of me...
[k]

？1：You were too lovely.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Kiyohime
Because I'm lovely[line 2][sr]So he didn't want to say anything harsh to me?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
I see...
[k]

？2：That's a man's pride.

＠Kiyohime
A man's pride?[sr]That is a matter that I am unable to comprehend.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
...Such a pathetic man.[sr]Putting on pride and running away...
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Kiyohime
...Well. I am still completely unable to[sr]comprehend the heart of a man.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Kiyohime
Tamamo tells me to trust her on matters between men and women. She says she can give me the perfect answer because of what she's been through[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Kiyohime
Those are the kinds of things she says...[sr]But for some reason, I just can't trust her.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Kiyohime
It seems to me she's the type that would turn to mush[sr]the moment a handsome man gazed at her seriously.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
She's usually open about her feelings, but once the man makes a move on her, she'd freeze up and get swept away.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Kiyohime
She always says, "It's so easy to control a man."[sr]But in reality, it's more like, "Serving obediently is true happiness."
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Kiyohime
In the Holy Grail War that we're in right now, perhaps it's a good idea to have an offline party sometimes.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Everyone knows she's a shut-in, so I don't know[sr]if that Osakabe-hime would show up.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Kiyohime
Oh, dear me! I'm sorry.[sr]I'm doing all the talking.

No, I'm quite fascinated by what you're talking about.[sr]Chat-room buddy... Offline Party...?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Kiyohime
I want to hear more about Master.[sr]How were you born, and how you've lived your life[line 2]
[k]

＠Kiyohime
What's your favorite food?[sr]And what's the food you dislike?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
What's the type of woman you like?[sr]What's the type of man you like?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
What your schedule is like every day?[sr]Where do you wash first in a shower?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Your height, weight, eyesight, grip strength, speed, endurance, lung capacity, whether you've run a marathon...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Kiyohime
Oh! I forgot one very important thing.[sr]Are there any temples that you're acquainted with[line 2]
[k]

＠Kiyohime
If possible, I'd like to hear about them.
[k]

？1：What would you do if I told you that?

？！

[charaFace D 3]
＠Kiyohime
It's a secret.[sr]Hehehehehehe...
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Master, your face has become stiff...

[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Kiyohime
Your nature as a mere beast.[sr]Perhaps it's because you only care about your appetite...
