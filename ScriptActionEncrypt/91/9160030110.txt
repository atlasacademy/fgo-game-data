Excuse me, Master.[sr]May I have a word with you?
[k]

？1：Welcome, Hundred Personas.
？2：Welcome, Asako.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Hundred Personas
Why did you call me that?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Hundred Personas
...No, never mind.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
As we are a conglomerate, our existence is unique.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
Even though you are contracted with multiple Servants, things involving us are sure to still bewilder you.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
And calling us by name is probably one of them. We are fine with whatever name you choose to differentiate us.

...No, actually we wanted to ask Master a favor.
[k]

？1：A favor?
？！

＠Hundred Personas
Yes. We need the assistance of someone familiar with the layout of Chaldea and who knows where people in it can be found.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
Which is to say, we will probably need Mash's help, too.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
If you don't mind, we would like you to listen, too, Mash.

We considered that approach, but if she could answer such a call, we would have found her a long time ago.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
Actually, ever since we were Summoned,[sr]we have been looking for her in our spare time.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
We did not go as far as make an announcement, but we did shout out her name, peek inside rooms, and check all the hallways.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
But since we still haven't come across her...
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
She either doesn't want to answer the call,[sr]or she simply can't.
[k]

＠Hundred Personas
That was our conclusion.[sr]That's why we need to search for her.
