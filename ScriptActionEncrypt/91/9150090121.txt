Goodbye, Michelangelo.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
While it was only where the arts were concerned...my dear friend, you had a gift that was comparable to my own.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But I wonder. Why were you hanging around the Mage's Association library?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Or perhaps... Did the abnormality of the Singularity cause any lingering spirits lurking around the British Museum...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

...to fall underground? Haha, perhaps the truth really is something silly like that.
