I see, I see. There are exponentially more spirits here than in the land where I lived.

...And I wonder what else is here?[sr]Let's keep looking around.

Ah. This bounded field technique is impressive! It's so intricately constructed, appropriate for a small island nation like this.
[k]

＠Geronimo
It's like a fine Persian rug...such wonderful detail.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Geronimo
The fields that we created were quite crude.[sr]However, even if one is intricately constructed...

Ah, yes. Unfortunately, the mage who constructed this seems to have been somewhat lacking in terms of power.

If this is the best they could do, my field would still have been better.

In addition to that, I am not human. At least not anymore. Either way, you are also a budding mage.

Am I correct in pointing out that you have already abandoned being human as well?

By the way, would you mind telling me why it is you put a field here?

Hm, for example...

[charaFace A 5]

＠Geronimo
Was your intention to conduct a sacrificial ritual using those children standing behind you?

Oh, on the contrary.[sr]This will have been your ill fortune.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Had it been some other mage, they might have tried to steal the fruits of your efforts, but not likely impeded your progress.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Or rather, if this was truly your territory,[sr]they might have avoided this area all together.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Wherever you may go, most people prefer to avoid conflict with people with whom they have no connection.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Geronimo
However, unfortunately for you, the ones who happened by were myself and my Master.
[k]

＠Geronimo
I am afraid we are not good enough mages to allow such egregious behavior to go ignored.
[k]

＠Geronimo
That, in turn, means that you have no opportunity to explain yourself or negotiate.
[k]

＠Geronimo
You must die right here.

I see, I see. How fitting in a city like London.[sr]He's a werewolf.

＠Geronimo
However, this is merely a superficial transformation using newer magecraft techniques.

＠Geronimo
His kind is nothing compared to the Phantasmals who are said to have lived since the Age of Gods.

[charaFace A 5]

＠Geronimo
The coyote from my nation would be a better adversary. Well, if he intends to fight, I have no choice.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Let's muzzle this beast, shall we? Here, boy.
