Whaaaa? He's still excited after all the monsters are defeated?

Last time, he calmed down the moment they were wiped out, and we could just go back[line 2]

It's been a while.[sr]When was the last time we met like this?
[k]

＠Alexander
Perhaps I'm one of the Servants you summoned?[sr]I can't be sure, since my connection has been severed.
[k]

＠Alexander
So it's pretty hard to figure out what's going on there, sorry about that.

It's the opposite of what happened in Rome.[sr]Because you called to me so much[line 2]
[k]

＠Alexander
It seems I ended up being chain summoned by you. Maybe this place is still affected by the Grail?

＠Alexander
I do have to say, your determination sure is strong. Since I'm like this, I can't really grasp the impact of my later years.
[k]

＠Alexander
But I have nothing but respect for you.[sr]O brave king of Persia.

He wants to fight me.[sr]In that case, I think I'll just have to face him.

＠Alexander
Since how we are summoned is reversed from last time, it would be fun to also reverse our roles in life!
[k]

＠Alexander
You'll be the one marching onward![sr]And I shall be the one who stands in your way!

＠Alexander
The king who will eventually stand before me, no, who stood before me, Darius III! Come!
[k]

＠Alexander
Let's battle it out![sr]Just how much I can fight in this form[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Alexander
I've always wanted to test it out![sr]With you, my beloved rival!
