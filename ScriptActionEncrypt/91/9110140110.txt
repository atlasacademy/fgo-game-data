Sorry to bother you during your break.[sr]I'm looking for the Servant Consultation Room. Is this it?
[k]

？1：We're closed today...

[charaFace D 4]
＠Fergus
Hm, just as I thought.[sr]But I'm begging you. It's urgent, you see.
[k]

？2：Yes and no?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Fergus
Hah hah hah. You deny and say it isn't so, but your face tells me you've given up on refusing, Master!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Fergus
You're probably fed up with indulging the selfishness of Servants day after day. I sympathize with you.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Fergus
So now, I'd like you to just give up again. I've got an urgent problem.
[k]

＠Fergus
Could you hear me out?

War is important, but whispering words of love to a woman is equally important to me.
[k]

＠Fergus
Of course, I'd never force myself on an unwilling woman. Understand that I just want to look at her and hit on her.

Senpai, Senpai![sr]I found sweet rice cakes in the Doctor's room!

These are quite exceptional.[sr]Let's eat them before anyone finds out.

But of course, the main topic is investigating the Doctor.

We must solve the mystery of how the Doctor stockpiles sweets in this time of scarcity...

If you carelessly start hitting on other Servants, it may end in a bloodbath...

If at least I could tell which Servants are okay to hit on...

Hey, those sweet rice cakes look pretty tasty.[sr]Let me try one, nom nom...

＠Dr. Roman
I installed several Servant profiles into the virtual training system.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They're a bit robotic, but they should at least respond to you.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So try this out first, and if it looks good, you can go hit on them for real. How does that sound?
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
It will be good for future reference.[sr]I'll use the results for personal reference.
