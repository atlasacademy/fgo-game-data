No, I have chosen the opponent.[sr]What I'm saying is[line 3]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Saber Alter
I don't know who that person is. It seems like that one[sr]is fundamentally different than the other Heroic Spirits.

＠Mash
Fundamentally different... Was there someone like[sr]that? Oh, I feel like Elisabeth might be different.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Saber Alter
That one is just a weird.[sr]...Well, you'll sense it when we arrive.

What is that? They're burying the horizon![sr]It's like the Great Wall of China is advancing on us...

Either way, we're busting through the wall [%1]. They don't see us as enemies.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
They're just like a massive steamroller that crushes everything before it.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
There's nothing to be gained by fighting them, and there are too many to defeat.
[k]

＠Saber Alter
Concentrate on a few and open a gap in the wall!
