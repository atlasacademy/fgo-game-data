？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠Wu Zetian
Keh heh heh. That's right! Now that you are working for me, you are officially an ambassador!
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
I remember meeting with a group of ambassadors from Japan. They prostrated themselves to me on behalf of their country to request an audience.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Well, ambassadorial visits from Japan began with the Sui dynasty, and Taizong also held audiences with them...
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
At any rate, now do you finally understand how lucky you are to be working for an esteemed empress like myself? Hmm?
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Go on, you needn't restrain yourself. If you cannot resist the urge to prostrate yourself before me and sing my praises...
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
...or feel overcome by the urge to serve as my chair,[sr]I give you permission to do so.

Oh hey, what should I call you, anyway?

Empress Wu? Wu Zhao? ...No, wait, that's your real name, right? Probably wouldn't be proper if I called you that.

＠Wu Zetian
Hmph... Wu Zetian is what I go by now,[sr]so that will suffice.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Of course, I also have many other excellent names, such as Dowager, Empress Dowager, Empress Regnant, Holy Empress Zetian...
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
...so you may use any of those[sr]as well if the mood takes you.

[k]

＠Sanzang
They say the name makes the person, so it seems like having too many variations may be a problem.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Wu Zetian
That is exactly the point. Once you get a better name, you become a better person.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Sanzang
Oh, yeah, good point![sr]That's a nice way to think about it!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Sanzang
Still, I think it'd be easier if I go with the same name everyone else is using, so I'll just go with Wu Zetian!
[k]

＠Sanzang
Otherwise, I might mess it up and call you by the name of one of the people I met on my journey to the west!

If you try to “pet” my darling dead with your thousand-palm slap, I'll just call up another ten thousand spirits from my mirror of darkness.

[charaFace E 9]

＠Nitocris
Yes, I am. To be frank, I think Xuanzang Sanzang will have a tough time fighting alone.

＠Nitocris
Hmm. If you want to get past me...I think the empress herself might just have to pitch in.
[k]

＠Nitocris
She may hate dead spirits, but she is possessed of a powerful will. Casting her fears aside and standing tall is the only path forward.
