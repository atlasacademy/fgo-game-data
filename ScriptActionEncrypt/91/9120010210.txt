We've arrived at the Massive Cavern in Fuyuki.[sr]Emiya, what's here, exactly?
[k]

＠Emiya
I sensed this presence when I came to "this" Fuyuki[sr]before. I've been waiting for the right timing.
[k]

？1：Right timing?

？2：Presence?

？！

A tough foe I've a particular attachment to[line 3][sr]Or an impassable wall, you could say.

＠Emiya
[%1], you're aware that I can't use my Noble Phantasm yet, of course.
[k]

＠Emiya
I've sealed it away, until you've grown strong enough as a Master.

＠Dr. Roman
So that's why. I thought that was weird. Your Noble Phantasm manifests the landscape in your mind.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
No catalyst is necessary.[sr]You simply need to be there.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Yet you couldn't use it. That's because you were[sr]waiting for [%1]'s growth, right?

I'm well-aware that it's nosy of me, but there is an order to all things, you see.
[k]

＠Emiya
I didn't want you to become the kind of Master who relies too much on Noble Phantasms.

[%1] has grown as a Master.[sr]Enough for you to use your Noble Phantasm, right?
[k]

？1：I can finally use Archer's Noble Phantasm!?

[charaFace D 3]
＠Emiya
Yes. You've done well so far.[sr]But first, there's one more thing you have to do.
[k]

？2：Thanks, but that's overprotective!

[charaFace D 4]
＠Emiya
I'll just have to ask you to resign yourself to it.[sr]I get too attached to those I like.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Emiya
It might look different, but this is still the Greater Grail.[sr]The Holy Grail War that happens here...
[k]

＠Emiya
Its strongest Servant awaits within.[sr]You will defeat it for me.
[k]

＠Emiya
If you can do that, I'll have nothing left to teach you.

Within...Does he mean...

Come on, get a hold of yourself![sr]Berserker! It's Berserker!
[k]

That giant lump of pitch darkness.[sr]Just like a walking hurricane.
[k]

[communicationCharaClear]

？2：...Berserker.

...That's right.[sr]The Servant we stood no chance against before.
