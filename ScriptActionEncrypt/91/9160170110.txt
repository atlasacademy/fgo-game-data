Wake up, Master.[sr]I said, wake up, Master.

Which is your desire, Master;[sr]the Iron Maiden or the Brazen Bull?

No idea.[sr]How should I be expected to know such a thing?

Yet, quite clearly it is a pleasant place.[sr]Your pet and companion are here as well.

Are you awake, Master?[sr]...We're trapped somewhere.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
It appears we're in some sort of Reality Marble[line 2][sr]I'm unable to contact Dr. Roman either.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Carmilla
It doesn't just appear to be, it most certainly is.[sr]This is my castle, after all.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
What do you mean, "your castle?"[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Carmilla
That's right, this is the Castle Csejte.[sr]It's best that you don't wonder off somewhere.
[k]

＠Carmilla
The chances of escaping this castle are a mere one in one thousand. You really ought to relax and wait.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
But...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Carmilla
At any rate, I know this castle and I'm not going anywhere.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Carmilla
I am quite comfortable here, after all.[sr]The smell of blood here is so, so dear to me.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Ugh.[sr]...What should we do, Master?
[k]

？1：Let's move on.

？2：Let's escape.

？！

[charaFace D 5]
＠Carmilla
...Wait a moment, Master.[sr]Did you not listen to a word I said?
[k]

？1：Of course.

？2：I heard every word.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Carmilla
In that case, surely you know that[sr]you won't find any lies or deception in my words.
[k]

＠Carmilla
Ask your companion, there. Have her tell you[sr]the blood-splattered legend of Elisabeth Báthory.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...I'll admit, it's exactly as Carmilla says.
[k]

＠Mash
The only person to ever to escape here[sr]was a one single maiden out of a thousand.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
I do believe your safest[sr]choice is to wait here...patiently.
[k]

？1：We've been imprisoned.

？2：There's no help coming for us.

？！

[charaFace D 5]
＠Carmilla
...!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
You're right. After all...if this is Castle Csejte, we have been imprisoned...!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The longer we wait, the more likely we'll be sacrificed...
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Carmilla
Ugh. J-Just how foolish can this woman be?[sr]Do you understand? This is MY castle.
[k]

＠Carmilla
How could I be locked inside my own castle?[sr]Such self-injurious action would never be...never be...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Carmilla
...ok, it's completely possible.
[k]

＠Carmilla
To drain the blood from a beautiful maiden. To skewer[sr]a hateful rival. If it were for that purpose, it is a possibility.
[k]

？1：...Let's get out of here.

？2：...Okay, we're escaping.

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Carmilla
...As infuriating as it is, I'd have to say that is the proper[sr]choice. For the moment, I think I shall follow your orders.

[charaFace D 1]

Do you think I would bother with such trivial matters?[sr]All I did was give the order, "Don't allow anyone to escape."
[k]

＠Carmilla
As to what manner of security measures were taken, do you think I would bother myself with that?
[k]

＠Mash
...Uh, well.[sr]Do you have any advice on how to escape?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Carmilla
None whatsoever. Why do you look at me that way?[sr]You are a mere commoner[line 3]Eek!?
