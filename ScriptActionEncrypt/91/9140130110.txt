Heh. You make light of Queen Medb. But too bad.[sr]You'll never see me cooing.

I was called to rule and to take from others. I only need talented warriors and fertile lands to plunder.

＠Medb
Just you wait. I'll make my preparations in secret, and invade you again and again.
[k]

＠Medb
Doctor Roman, was it? You should store the Holy Grails in places harder to find.
[k]

＠Medb
You look easy to seduce. If three more Servants as wicked as me get involved, the Holy Grails would easily be taken.

Did I mention that “creating soldiers” and the typical “birth” are separate things to me?
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Mash
No, you didn't. Please elaborate.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Medb
I'm the Queen of Connacht. So giving birth to soldiers isn't like giving birth to an heir.
[k]

＠Medb
To make a soldier, I just need the bodily fluids of a warrior.
[k]

＠Medb
I take them into my chariot, we lie together, and then I prick my index finger and drip blood on to the ground.
[k]

＠Medb
Like mixing blood into mead, you see.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
