Based on my observation, I couldn't detect anything. Um, maybe I should expand the range?

Hmmm, you are in 1st century Gaul, within the second singularity that's being corrected.

Someone is calling me here. I'm certain that I felt it.
[k]

＠Altera
It's a destructive...impulse. What's worse, it's extraordinary.

Even if it destroys everything in sight, it still won't calm down... That's what it is.

It's more like a forced command, one more powerful than Command Spells. That's what I've sensed.
[k]

？1：Are you sure about that?

[charaFace A 7]

Yes, I am wondering the same.

I'm familiar with her name, but it feels unrealistic to have a wife.
