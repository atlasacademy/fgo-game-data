I don't really get what's going on there, but am I right in assuming there's going to be a fight in the simulator?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Well, just don't get hurt, okay?

What do you think, Sun King?

Escape and defeat are not fit for the divinity of the pharaohs! Thus...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Iskandar
That's right. If you run, you must renounce the title of pharaoh.

Never address yourself that way. Never use the name. And...let's see... Say you're sorry for being a pharaoh up until now.

Then you must fight. I don't have to say this, but you'll face the same consequences if you lose. It'd also be boring if you threw the game.

On the contrary, if you win... we'll give you some sort of reward.

Nitocris, even after receiving my endless splendor, will your mirror still reflect darkness, or won't it?

If you're a pharaoh, then withstand it! If you can't, you will fade away. That's all there is to it!

I'm an inexperienced pharaoh.[sr]But the fact that I am still a pharaoh is my pride.

If I'm going to lose that, then I can't afford to run or lose!

I must win this fight no matter what! Lend me your power! No, PLEASE lend me your power!
