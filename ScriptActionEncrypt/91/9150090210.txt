...That all happened a long time ago.[sr]A VERY long time ago.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
My family were notaries in the village of Vinci. Had been for generations. They were pretty well off, all things considered.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
My parents were never married. My mother, Caterina, was beautiful, but she was also a peasant.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Da Vinci
Back then, there was no way she or my father, Messer Piero, could possibly have been permitted to make their love official.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In other's eyes, she just wasn't good enough. I don't want to say it because it's too crass. But...that is essentially what people thought of their love.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Da Vinci
Still, that didn't stop them from having a beautiful child together.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Da Vinci
...she married another man after she gave birth to me. They had many children of their own. That's all well and good.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It was certainly better than continuing in a relationship that could never lead to marriage, and she didn't have to worry about me. My grandfather and uncle on the[sr]Da Vinci side took care of me.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Da Vinci
I grew up healthy and happy, and it wasn't long before my abundant talents started helping me accomplish amazing things...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...but I never forgot about my mother. It wasn't an obsession, really. But I thought about her often.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Da Vinci
I think it was Botticelli who said that “enough is plenty”? It certainly sounds like something he'd say.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Da Vinci
Anyway, when I was about forty or so, my mother fell ill. She died shortly thereafter.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I had a bit of money back then,[sr]so I tended to her sometimes.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That is why I was able to be there when she finally slipped off. Oh, I held her funeral as well. It was a rather nice funeral, at that.

I painted it in Milan, a few years before I had my mother come live with me. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out...
