＠Nero
Sorry about that [%1].[sr]I have some personal business I need your help with.
[k]

＠Nero
...The United Empire is gone, and Rome is in an ephemeral peace.
[k]

[wt 0.3]

＠Nero
However, the one who led Rome as its first citizen,[sr]Nero Claudius is no longer there.
[k]

＠Nero
Rather, the human "Nero" is no longer there because[sr]I contracted with you, [%1].
[k]

＠Nero
The human "Nero" already left Rome just like in history.[sr]Now "I" sit as its Emperor.

The Era's ability to bring back the past...[sr]No, to repair itself.
[k]

＠Mash
As long as the Servant Nero is here, the Emperor Nero must be dead.
[k]

＠Mash
In normal space and time, both the human before death and the Servant after death can exist simultaneously.
[k]

＠Mash
But in a Singularity, "what's accurate" and[sr]"what's stronger" ends up taking precedence.
[k]

＠Mash
Once the Heroic Spirit Nero contracted with you,[sr]the Nero at Septem became this Nero, unfortunately.
[k]

？1：You didn't have to say "unfortunately,"  Mash.

＠Nero
It's fine. You were just lamenting[sr]the fact that I passed away, correct?
[k]

＠Nero
If that's the case, I forgive you. Actually, I'm happy.[sr]You mourned me, even though I was called a tyrant.
[k]

？2：Is that bad?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Yes, sorry about that Emperor Nero.
[k]

＠Mash
Well, it's a confusing problem, so I ended up using a negative expression...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Emperor Nero, no...Nero.[sr]You are definitely here in Rome.
[k]

＠Mash
I am happy about such fortune, Emperor.

Umu, you're a really nice girl, Mash!

You feel regret for your mistakes, and feel happy when good things happen.
[k]

＠Nero
I'll forgive what you said with that smile of yours.[sr]You can accompany me to a bath later as an apology!

...Oh, not good. I always get carried[sr]away when [%1] is around.

＠Nero
There's only one reason why we've come to Septem.[sr]I want you to help me, Master.
[k]

＠Nero
Remember when I brought out a boat last time?[sr]I heard a little something during the voyage.
[k]

＠Nero
Supposedly there's a ghost that appears in the cursed deserts on the outskirts of Rome.
[k]

＠Nero
I think I might know who that ghost is.
[k]

＠Nero
Right now, I'm carrying out my royal duties as a Servant,[sr]but I'm not sure when I'll finish them and disappear.
[k]

＠Nero
That's why before that happens...[sr]I want to ease Rome's pain with my own two hands.
[k]

？1：I'd love to help.

？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠Nero
[line 3]Umu.[sr]I am counting on you, one who contracted with me.

？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠Nero
Umu, it should be around here. The shape of the rocks, the sound of the wind, the faded color of the setting sun...
[k]

＠Nero
I remember it all, even now. The fate of an emperor[sr]who died here, in these wastelands.

＠Nero
Umu. This is where I died.[sr]Nero Claudius slit her own throat here.
[k]

＠Nero
Nero loved the people and she continually showed her burning passion...
[k]

＠Nero
However, it wasn't the warm love people knew of.
[k]

＠Nero
Nero only knew how to love one way. To demand,[sr]give, and burn away... Violently.
[k]

＠Nero
It was like forcing people to do things, you may say.[sr]Nero didn't realize even until her end, that her actions were like poison to the people.
[k]

＠Nero
Nero made a mistake that weakened her own position,[sr]and was chased away from her throne by the senate.
[k]

＠Nero
The army turned against her, but even then she believed[sr]that the people she loved so passionately would defend her.
[k]

＠Nero
...I don't think I need to tell you what happened.[sr]The people didn't defend the foolish tyrant.
[k]

＠Nero
Although Nero escaped from her pursuers, she chose to end her life out of grief.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Nero
[line 3]I can't say what Nero was grieving over.[sr]Just that her life ended here.
[k]

＠Nero
But...Nero didn't die that easily.
[k]

＠Nero
Or more like she couldn't die, rather.[sr]She couldn't breathe. Her heart ached. Her eyes burned.
[k]

＠Nero
It was like being driven to madness by a never-ending fever.
[k]

＠Nero
Three days passed and Nero still wasn't[sr]discovered by her pursuers.
[k]

＠Nero
She woke at sunset each day,[sr]for she thought she heard people calling out her name.
[k]

＠Nero
It was the sound of the people that she loved. She knew[sr]they didn't blame Emperor Nero. That they were praising her.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Nero
Haha, talk about adding insult to injury.[sr]That couldn't have been, it just couldn't.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Nero
Even so... Nero awoke, just to verify what she heard.
[k]

＠Nero
At the first sunset, she sniffed her nose to an illusion.[sr]At the second sunset, she bit her lips to the inaudible calls.
[k]

＠Nero
And at the third sunset[line 3]

...That's right.[sr]Emperor Nero said her last words.
[k]

＠Mash
A soldier found her body, exposed in the wilderness,[sr]and out of pity, covered her with a cloth.
[k]

＠Mash
At that moment, Emperor Nero opened her eyes and[sr]said: "Too late, but how noble of you."
[k]

Umu, my fate ended there.
[k]

＠Nero
I don't know what Nero was thinking at the very end.
[k]

＠Nero
But Nero was okay with that.[sr]Even if it wasn't by the people she loved so much[line 3]
[k]

＠Nero
The tyrant was happy that her life ended with[sr]the warmth of a human.
[k]

＠Nero
That's the deus ex machina that I dream of even now.
[k]

＠Nero
Because no matter what happened, it was that very[sr]miracle which made the story a happy ending.
[k]

＠Nero
If that soldier hadn't come along, I would have still[sr]been waiting in the wilderness for the impossible.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Nero
And that is why![sr]Why I must kill you!
[k]

＠Nero
A tyrant's wandering dream![sr]The reflection of a flower that forgot how to wither!
[k]

＠Nero
The ghost of mine that cannot accept this end![sr]Show yourself and take up your sword!
