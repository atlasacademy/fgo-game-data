＠Holmes
Hm. This has turned into quite the aerial battle,[sr]but it appears Dos Mil Máscaras has the upper hand.
[k]

？1：Are Quetzalcoatl's moves not working?

？！

＠Holmes
Her moves are pretty flashy and nothing else. An expert martial artist like Dos Mil Máscaras can evade her easily.
[k]

＠Holmes
On the other hand, he's definitely hurting Miss Quetzalcoatl with his moves.
[k]

＠Holmes
Seems he has studied Baritsu. His moves are nimble,[sr]and he's definitely hitting the vital spots.

＠Quetzalcoatl
You're looking nervous, Máscara. I'll take this opportunity to answer your question.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Your attacks are effective, efficient, and very painful, yes! But the pain is still tolerable.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Why? Because...!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Quetzalcoatl
The limpio would never let the rudo's attacks defeat them, no! Instead, the more I get hit, the more fired up I get, yes!

Yep. This is not worth getting turned into a greasy smear on the floor.
[k]

＠Dos Mil Máscaras
I kinda half-assed taking this job. If it was a life-and-death sort of fight, I'd have asked for a lot more money to do it.
[k]

＠Dos Mil Máscaras
So, you win, since you took everything I had without going down. You good with that, Miss Lucha?
[k]

＠Dos Mil Máscaras
If the opponent admits defeat, that's the end of the match. Isn't that the best bit of pro wrestling?

That is correct, yes![sr]I feel like you and I will get along fine, yes!

＠Quetzalcoatl
...So I am a little disappointed. If we ever get to meet again, I'd like to see the face behind your mask!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Because if you stick to being shy,[sr]you might just lose your heart. ¿Entendido?
[k]

＠Dos Mil Máscaras
Ha. Thanks for that warning.[sr]I'd...uh...rather not ever meet you again...
