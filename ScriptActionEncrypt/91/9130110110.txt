What[line 2][sr]I'm not so special a man.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Fionn
Indeed, I'm a man that would be categorized as a great hero. But that's just the end result.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Fionn
I killed a raging demonic beast, and slaughtered a creature from the underworld you could call death itself.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Fionn
But, all that is expected of a guardian of Erin, a warrior serving the High King.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Fionn
The deed would have been done without me.[sr]For we are the glorious Knights of Fianna!

Haha, surely you jest.[sr]I'm just a man. I've nothing to brag about to anyone[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Fionn
Am I sure? Well, I'm sure I'm the hero who managed to slay a fallen Divine Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Fionn
I'm the descendant of the war god Nuadha, and the central figure in the Erin myth? But see, that's merely the end result.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Fionn
I'm simply a man. Yes[line 2]just a handsome man whose face is slightly more beautiful.
[k]

？1：You called yourself a handsome man!?
？2：What self-confidence.

？！


[charaTalk B]
＠Dr. Roman
Ugh, so bright! It's like a flood of self-confidence and bragging, isn't it!?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Why does it hit me so hard... So this is Fionn mac Cumhaill, the most fulfilled man in all of Erin!

Protector of peace who has beaten many monsters[line 2][sr]He's fit to be called a hero, a great hero.

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
But, well, Master.[sr]Well...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Fionn had his fair share of problems...[sr]Calamities...or more like troubles...
[k]

？1：Has he?
？2：I think I've heard something.

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Yes. You might say he had “lady troubles.”
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
Fionn may not be personally responsible, but if what I heard about the Knights of Fianna's downfall is true...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
it was partly due to his actions.[sr]At the very least, that's how the knights portray it.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
By not saving the life of his reconciled subordinate, Diarmuid, he lost his charisma, and the order[sr]collapsed[line 2]

[k]

＠Mash
(Like when we met Alexander before. Not the King of Conquerors of his later years, but the boy.)

[charaFace D 3]

Yes, I need only stand still, and noble ladies will propose to me. I even once received a twin love confession from a lovely pair of witch sisters.

That it made an evil fairy start stalking me like an idiot! Oh, this is all part of my destiny of endless lady troubles!

Oh, however, I don't want to put the blame on you ladies.

To the Ancient Roman era that's under correction,[sr]and heading out specifically to Gaul[line 2]
