The enemies were spineless! How careless of them to put such weaklings on the front lines!

Master, I have my report for you:[sr]evacuation of the townspeople is not yet complete.

We've gotten about forty percent out. I'm impressed with how well Diarmuid has handled the women...

＠Hundred Personas
But there are still children and the elderly.[sr]It won't be easy evacuating them all.
