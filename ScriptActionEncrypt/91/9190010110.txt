[line 2]I am having a dream.[r][line 2]"She" is smiling happily.
[k]

＠Jeanne
To kill all evil, to trample over evil, it's the right thing to do.
[k]

＠Jeanne
That's why she's "happy."[sr]That's why she's laughing.
[k]

＠Jeanne
[line 2]Ahh... I don't have that kind of "emotion."[sr][line 2]But still...
[k]

Could that be...[sr]"something" that is unattainable?

But since you seem so happy, Jeanne, I'm glad for you.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
I-I am sorry.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Jeanne, your hometown is Domremy, correct?[sr]I wonder if it's close to here.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
If you'd like, why don't you pay them a visit?
[k]

＠Jeanne
I'm afraid France is a very large country...[sr]I can't ask the both of you to accompany for that long.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne
Besides, I don't believe I should return.
[k]

＠Jeanne
When I decided to save France, I made up my mind that I could never return to my village.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Is that so...
[k]

？1：Have you ever thought about returning?

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
...Hmm, you asked a cruel question, Master.[sr]Yes, I have thought about wanting to return.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
Many, many times. Especially whenever I felt the burning[sr]sensation in my old arrow wound.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
But you never returned.
[k]

＠Jeanne
No. Even if[line 2]everything went well, and there was nothing to prevent me from returning.
[k]

＠Jeanne
...I just felt that I should not return.[sr]I mean, I threw it all away.
[k]

＠Jeanne
My family, my village, everything.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
You can't be serious...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Hehe. It's all hypothetical anyway.[sr]I was captured, and put to the flame.
[k]

＠Jeanne
It's all over now.
[k]

＠Jeanne
If we were to change that, I would end up like how Gilles was then.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
[line 2]But, I don't understand why.
[k]

＠Jeanne
On every occasion, people assumed that I have regrets.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
But...that really can't be helped.
[k]

＠Mash
You see, people tend to have regrets about their life[line 2][sr]For simply being young.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
Yes, you're right.[sr]That is quite correct.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Time...If I had time, I would've done what I wanted to do.[sr]Or, I would've done the things I couldn't.
[k]

＠Jeanne
...Even if I didn't have either... I could at[sr]least have found something that I wanted to do.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Humans have unlimited possibilities, and the younger you are, those chances skyrocket.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
But I simply threw that away.[sr]I was a fool, and certainly no saint.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Really?[sr]Then, I too have[line 2]
[k]

？1：You too, Mash?

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Oh! No, I mean ...It's nothing.[sr]Forget about that, Master. I can see a town.

Thank goodness.[sr]If it's peaceful, there's nothing that could be better.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne
...Huh?
[k]

＠Mash
What's the matter?
[k]

The castle flag... It's the flag of England.[sr]This place must be...under England's control.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes, that certainly isn't the flag of France.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Is this one of the situation...[sr]That needs to be fixed?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Certainly if they're oppressed, but it feels unnecessary[sr]for now. We shouldn't accidentally cause any trouble...
[k]

＠Jeanne
...Absolutely.[sr]That is absolutely right, but...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne
No, I'm sorry. That was just my personal feeling.[sr]I am entirely your Servant now, [%1].

France did not rise in defiance, was defeated, became the domain of England[line 2]and now enjoys peace.
