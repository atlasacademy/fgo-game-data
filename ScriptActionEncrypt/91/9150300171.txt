Kh...ghh... Not yet. It's not...over yet...

＠Scheherazade
And so, with the information gained from the Lion King, you learned that the Seventh Singularity existed long ago, in the distant B.C. era...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
I see. That was the Holy Grail the King of Mages sent far, far back in time. The Singularity that held the key to everything...

But, um...before we get to that,[sr]could I ask you something else?

Did you have any...reservations? About forming contracts with the Knights of the Round Table...?

＠Mash
Well...I can't say the thought never crossed my mind.[sr]Only at first, though.

＠Mash
The Heroic Spirit summoning system doesn't[sr]summon the heroes of history themselves.
[k]


＠Mash
It essentially downloads the information recorded about them in the Throne, assigns it to a class, and then materializes them in Servant form.
[k]

＠Mash
So I understand that each time a hero is summoned as a Servant, they are essentially a different version of the same person.
[k]

＠Mash
Though I have read they may retain some of the memories from when they were summoned by other means.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Scheherazade
So that is why you weren't concerned... I see.[sr]But...in my case...
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠Mash
(...Oh. I think I'm starting to understand[sr]what Scheherazade is worried about now...)
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Scheherazade
...My apologies for asking such an insipid question.[sr]I meant nothing by it.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
All right...let's move on to[sr]the Seventh Singularity...
