You're a mage. So perhaps you think[sr]physical strengthening is unnecessary.

[k]

＠Leonidas
You must improve your strength and endurance![sr]Relax, my calculations are flawless!
[k]

？1：I feel even more nervous now...

？2：I'm not so sure about that...

？！

＠Leonidas
Yes, just leave everything to me![sr]Come on, let's be off.
