＠
The line between man and beast is quite clear.
[k]

＠
Beasts bare their fangs on instinct, with only the slightest fragment of rationality to guide them.
[k]

＠
Humans, on the other hand, battle their enemies[sr]by chaining instinct with rationality.
[k]

＠
But he...he was unable to pick a side.
[k]

＠
He had one foot in the realm of beasts,[sr]and another in the realm of humans...
[k]

＠
...leaving him neither fully human, nor fully animal.
[k]

＠
Lobo the Wolf King.[sr]The beast with the right to seek revenge.
[k]

＠
Will you exercise that right?

Feasting on prey...[sr]Baring one's fangs at enemies...

Running from those stronger than you...[sr]Learning their scent, and never going near them again...

But once you begin to lead a pack,[sr]that simple life is no longer an option.

The wolf had subordinates. A mate. Cubs.

And so, he had to fight.
