You, Hektor, are the opposite of me. You specialize in defense, as proven by your successful defense of Troy for ten years.

And so I demand you teach me what you know. So long as it does not clash with Amazon tradition, I will accept any and all instruction.

No, now that I think about it, I can simply adapt your teachings to our own style. Perhaps it could culminate in an offensive defense capable of killing one's enemies... Yes, I like that.

Still, I want to at least say this. Even I wouldn't usually say something like that in a battle. Of course I wouldn't.
