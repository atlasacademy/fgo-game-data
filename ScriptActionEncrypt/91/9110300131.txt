＠Suzuka Gozen
...Just so you guys know, Master,[sr]they were basically right about me.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
I'm the daughter of the Demon King of the Fourth Heaven. I'm just another Servant, just another Saber.
[k]

[charaFace B 17]

＠Suzuka Gozen
But...that doesn't change the fact that I'm a high school girl at heart. That's just who I am now. Capisce?
[k]

？1：...Why did you pick that of all things?

[charaFace B 3]

＠Suzuka Gozen
It's not about a choice![sr]It's about being true to myself above all!

Actually I'm curious about that too.[sr]If you don't mind, would you please tell us why?

Aha, so you DO get it, Master.

＠Suzuka Gozen
(Sigh)... Look, a lot of real crazy[sr]stuff went down while I was alive.
[k]

[charaFace B 13]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Then, after I became a Heroic Spirit, I found out what modern high school girls are like, right?
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
They're, like, the embodiment of popularity, beauty, and cuteness. That is just, like, super fab.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Plus, they enjoy life to the fullest! So I thought, this is it. This is what I've been looking for.
[k]

[charaFace B 16]

＠Suzuka Gozen
...Totally makes sense, right?
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
So my wish is to find the best boyfriend ever, have the best romance ever, and get the whole happily ever after thing, 'kay?
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
So, to do that, I decided to be the[sr]best teenage high school girl ever.

[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
So, as a fellow teenage girl, you're gonna tell me the truth about your experiences with boys when we get to the break room!
