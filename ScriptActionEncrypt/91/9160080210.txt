...The ideal body! [wt 0.1][charaFace A 2][wt 0.5]That is what I seek!!![charaEffect C bit_talk_41]

＠Cleopatra
Indeed, has there ever been anyone in history who has not endeavored to sculpt their body into a monument to absolute physical perfection?
[k]

＠Cleopatra
Of course not! And that's why we're here![sr]Is that clear, Master!?

＠Cleopatra
(Sigh)...
[k]


[charaFace A 5]
＠Cleopatra
So I have to explain this whole thing again, do I?[sr]Well, I won't! Besides, as my secretary, you should already know what I mean!
[k]


＠Cleopatra
You only get to be a pharaoh's secretary because you truly understand them!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Cleopatra
Now, begin the preparations!
[k]

？1：Preparations?

？！

＠Cleopatra
To help me get in shape, obviously!
[k]

＠Cleopatra
You have my permission to activate the simulator!
[k]


[charaFace A 1]
＠Cleopatra
After all, there is no better way to get in shape than exercising, and there is no exercise more effective or beautiful than my Pharaoh Fighting Style!
[k]

＠Cleopatra
I already practice for an hour every morning to maintain my looks and my health, of course, but that's not the same as using it in live combat.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Cleopatra
Which is why now is the time for live combat!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Cleopatra
...Or at least, it would be, if something would attack us. (Sigh) Where's a pack of marauders when you need them?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cleopatra
Anyway, since I can't count on actual enemies to invade in accordance with my workout schedule, I decided to compromise and use the simulator with some help from other Heroic Spirits here.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
I trust you understand all that now?
[k]

？1：More or less!


[charaFace A 1]


＠Cleopatra
Good! That was a beautiful answer![wt 0.7][charaFace A 2][sr]Now, let us be on our merry way!
[k]

？2：What if someone's already using the simulator?


[charaFace A 4]
＠Cleopatra
Oh, right. I hadn't thought of that... [wt 0.8][charaFace A 2]Well, if that[sr]turns out to be the case, that will just mean fate has chosen to aid me by providing me with an opponent!

I was just using the simulator[sr]to check up on my battle summons...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]


＠Nitocris
Is there a reason you came all this way?[sr]I don't want to be rude...
[k]


＠Nitocris
...but couldn't you just set the simulator the way you want for your own training?[sr][wt 0.8][charaFace B 7]Cleopatra, what are you[line 2]

No. No, Pharaoh Nitocris.[sr]No more words.

[charaFace A 2]
＠Cleopatra
What I need right now is not talk, but exercise. Hard, strenuous, fat-burning exercise! I can't possibly get that from mere NPCs.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
Now go on, don't hold back. Hit me with your best shot! On my honor as pharaoh, I can take whatever you throw at me!

？1：It's okay. Please spar with her.
？2：I'm her secretary right now, so whatever she says, goes.

？！


[charaFace B 9]
＠Nitocris
V-very well then. I'll admit, fighting another Servant should help with my own training too!
