...Simulation complete. Both have only suffered minor damage to their Spirit Cores.

＠Mash
Also, um... Those were soul eaters.[sr]Not bears.

？1：It said they were bears.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The Doctor was being silly.[sr]Doctor, I don't think that's a good idea.

Sorry, I was getting too into it... But I think it was the only way [charaFace B 0]to calm down Shuten-Douji.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
She may look refined, but she's the most brutal oni of them all.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
She might've attacked [%1] if she got bored.

＠Mash
Yes, you're right. Both of them were extremely agitated...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
But I'm glad we made it back safe.[sr]Good work, Senpai.

And you too, of course, sweaty little boy.[sr]That was quite the invective for being impromptu.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I bet you could've taught those nobles in Kyoto a thing or two about plays.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Sakata Kintoki
I'm never reading poems or haikus again.[sr]Bikes are the big thing now.

...Sigh. Damn it, I got all worked up. You look unconcerned as ever... You were just toying with me, huh?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
How much of what you say is just an act?[sr]Crap, I'm so tired...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
Fufufufufufu. How much is an act?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Of course, I'm always serious.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Sakata Kintoki
...R-Right.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Fufufu. You're still a kid. Even though you're SUCH a big and handsome man.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Fighting for your life while drunk, outwitting your opponent while pressing your body against theirs...[sr]Now that's amusing.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Shuten-Douji
[line 3]Don't you think so, Master?
[k]

？1：R-Right.
？2：I-I didn't think you'd ask me.

Wow. In the face of a drunk Shuten-Douji, Heroic Spirits and their Master are all nothing but playthings.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm not sure if that's just how oni are, or just how she is, though.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...Yeah. I-I'll do my best, too...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Yeah, I don't think that's necessary.[sr]Actually, let's just get back to work. Yeah.
