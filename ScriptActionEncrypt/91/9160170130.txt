...Hmph! The hem of my dress has been torn.[sr]That was somewhat of an inconvenience.

Let us be on our way, Master.[sr]The exit shouldn't be far.

What's the matter, Carmilla?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Carmilla
Nothing at all. Only a slight headache.[sr]...Master, let me ask you this.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Carmilla
This is just an "if." If the door does not open...[sr]and we are truly locked in this castle, what will you do?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Carmilla
Would you give up in despair?[sr]Or would you[line 2]?
[k]

？1：I would find another exit.

？2：I would not give up.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Carmilla
...I see.[sr]I figured you would say as much.
[k]

＠Carmilla
Even in such a desperate situation, you'll continue fighting without giving up.
[k]

＠Carmilla
Just because you've been imprisoned,[sr]you're not the type to lie down and give up.

An enemy![sr]It's a[line 2]Shadow Servant...!?

[charaFace D 4]
＠Carmilla
Oh, dear... I am imprisoned again.[sr]Again, I am all alone.
[k]

＠Carmilla
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again there is no one to rescue me...!!
[k]

＠Carmilla
No! No! Stop...! I don't want to[sr]go back to that place! No! No! Noooo!
[k]

？1：Pull yourself together!

？2：I will rescue you this time.

？！

Here it comes...!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Carmilla
[line 2]So it is.[sr]Now, I am your Servant.
[k]

＠Carmilla
Even though it was my fate to become imprisoned, it is illogical that you should be imprisoned as well.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Carmilla
Master! Mash! Listen to me closely.[sr]This is merely "darkness!"
[k]

＠Carmilla
It is a darkness that envelopes this castle, preventing[sr]escape. It is the final barrier, the absolute ruler.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Carmilla
I cannot overcome this alone.[sr]But now, I have you with me.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Carmilla
To battle! Now is the time for me[sr]to make these ones pay for what has been done!
