For a Servant, past Holy Grail Wars are more like hazy dreams than distant memories.
[k]

＠Atalante
No matter how strong a past bond might be, it will inevitably fade.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Atalante
...Of course it will. Fighting a hundred Holy Grail Wars is like leading a hundred lives.
[k]

＠Atalante
More than anything, it ceases to feel real.[sr]You stop being able to cling to just one life.
[k]

＠Atalante
It doesn't mean we're choosing a noble death.[sr]We're simply abandoning a pallid life.

So we forget them[line 2]like they were the dreams we once had. But some things cannot be forgotten.
[k]

＠Atalante
That battle, to me, was one of them.
