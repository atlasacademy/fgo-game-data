I am sure you already know this, but let me tell you about the state of my database, just so we are all caught up.
[k]


＠Danzo
My body was created by Kashin Koji...
[k]

＠Danzo
...and my Fuuma ninja arts were installed by the first Fuuma clan leader, Lord Kotarou's predecessor.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_11 0.1]

＠Danzo
Following my creation, I served as[sr]a shinobi during the age of war.
[k]

＠Danzo
During that time, I accumulated many different experiences in the course of my duties.
[k]

＠Danzo
I served many different masters,[sr]and carried out many different missions.

Yes... They give me the impression that I was there doing...something...for a fairly long time...

＠Danzo
But unfortunately, they are far too fragmented, and the details too unclear, to tell what that was...

[charaFace A 0]

The only thing I know for certain is that,[sr]in the end, I completely ceased to function.
