[charaFace D 4]
＠Diarmuid
What happened after that, I don't need to tell you. I was not granted the king's healing.

＠Fionn
What a strange man you are. Don't you feel any hate towards me?
[k]

＠Fionn
Yes. In this forest, at this place, I refused to share water after you had collapsed..
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Fionn
I could have saved you under the circumstances, yet I abandoned you on purpose, you see?

You need not bite your thumb. I'm sure your new Master completely understands that.

[charaFace E 5]
＠Fionn
For one thing[line 3] You don't regret it.
[k]

＠Fionn
Even if you are summoned to a Holy Grail War somewhere, you'd not hope to overturn this unfortunate death.
[k]

＠Fionn
If you trace the cause of this misfortune, it was actually caused by my queen, Gráinne.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Fionn
You loved Gráinne, and you also reconciled with me.
[k]

＠Fionn
Therefore, you should accept this ending[line 2][sr]That's what you are thinking, right?

However, while you feel you weren't wrong, your true self regrets and resents!

Why did I not give you water back then?[sr]Why did I not heal your wounds?

What should you have done back then, and such!

Haha, correct! I'm a materialization of your resentment. What you were ashamed of and had sealed away[line 2]

The “something” that you cowered and ran away from, so you can keep pretending to be a knight.
