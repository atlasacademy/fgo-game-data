Killing you in a memory wouldn't make it real. That's just death within a fantasy. It'll only leave a bitter aftertaste.

＠Cú Chulainn
“Gate of Skye.” Have you seen it? It's a move where her enemies are dragged down into the Land of Shadows.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
At the bottom of the Land of Shadows, they're as good as dead. All living things simply perish.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

But then you don't even use it! If that's not holding back, what is, Scáthach!?

Looks like I got you there.[sr]That's a once in a lifetime sight.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_11 1.0]

＠Cú Chulainn
...Is it because you're summoned as a Servant now? You're showing off a human side of yourself.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
But I guess that's partly due to Master's influence.[sr]After all, Master's the most human of all humans I know.
[k]

？1：What do you mean?
？2：Is that a thing? That doesn't sound like a thing.

？！

[bgm BGM_EVENT_6 1.0]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
It means you always try your best, as much as you're able. And anything you can't do, you still try to find a way.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
You borrow wisdom from those came before you, and dream of a future. No matter how dire the situation, and fight as humanly as possible.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
At times you may be discouraged. You may look back to the past. But stopping and looking back is only for a moment.

Scáthach. For you to desire death is just your way of trying to escape. And that isn't you at all.

To allow you, of all people, to see my doubts.[sr]As a mentor, there is no greater disgrace.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Scáthach
Hrm. In order to offset this disgrace, I may need you to die three times.

[charaFace C 2]

Now you're just taking it out on us!

[charaFace B 1]

Idiot. It's to clear my name. But since I wasn't falsely accused of anything, I simply need to overwrite my disgrace by doing something even more heinous.
