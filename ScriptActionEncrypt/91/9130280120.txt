Nope. Nothing. Nothing at all.[sr]What about you?

Same here.[sr]I don't feel anything for this place.

[charaFace B 14]

＠Ishtar
...I see. By the way, I feel like you've been a lot less deferential to me since we got here.
[k]

[charaTalk C]

＠Emiya
It's better that way. After all, we're both Servants who got summoned by the same Master.
[k]

＠Emiya
A Heroic Spirit who can't work with others because they're obsessed with their position in some hierarchy isn't worth the energy it took to summon them.
[k]

＠Emiya
That...and I suppose I do feel a bit more at ease since we're in Japan. I'm more comfortable here than places like England or France.

Let me answer your question with my own question...because that's the jaguar way. Do you all know what this jaguar hates?

？1：I...do not, no.

[charaFace A 2]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Hey! That's no good! You need to show more interest in me! Specifically, you need to pet me more in My Room!
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
And so you know, the answer is: lions.
