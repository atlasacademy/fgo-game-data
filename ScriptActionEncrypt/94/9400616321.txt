＠E：Boar Piglet
Treats?
[k]

＠C：Boar Piglet
There's medicine for stomachaches from eating too many treats, yup.
[k]

＠D：Boar Piglet
It won't make you drowsy or tired either. Plus it works as a painkiller. Oh, and it cures cavities and appendicitis, yup.
[k]

＠E：Boar Piglet
And it's completely LEGAL, yup!

＠Mash
Those were some truly fantastic songs.
[k]

＠Mash
A standing ovation... Thunderous applause... The boar piglets seem extremely pleased with the outcome, too.
[k]

＠Mash
...Just one thing, though.
[k]

＠Mash
For some reason all of the songs they chose had troubling lyrics and a dark tone.
[k]

＠Mash
Like “One, two, Freddy's coming for you”... “Don't you ever laugh as the hearse goes by”... and “Bloody Mary”...
