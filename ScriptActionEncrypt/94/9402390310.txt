All right, if you insist... Anyway, I believe we have sufficiently verified that he is, in fact, dead.

＠Hawthorne
Given how much his body has cooled, I'd put his time of death at around midnight. Of course, the cause of death will be more important than the time.
[k]

＠Juliet
What do you think, Doctor?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Hawthorne
Poison would seem the most likely answer. Still, I can't tell what sort of poison, or how it entered his bloodstream.

I may be a doctor, but I must admit that this isn't exactly my area of expertise. I can't even be sure whether this poison was mixed into food or drink, or if he was injected with it somehow.

[k]

＠Hawthorne
In fact, she was the one who chose me to be the Violet family's doctor after her daughters were born.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Hawthorne
I owe a great debt to the Violet family for providing me with a steady income for so many years...which is why I'm so reluctant to bring this up.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
I'm guessing the Goldie and Violet families came across as typical members of the upper class to you...
[k]

＠Hawthorne
...but they are, in fact, two of the[sr]oldest crime families in the country.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
All that they have is built[sr]upon violence and blood money.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
However, in the past few years,[sr]they've found themselves in a dangerous position.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Hawthorne
For a long time, they were fighting each other[sr]tooth and nail for control of a certain city.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
But now both are under attack from a new enemy,[sr]and that attack has exhausted their resources.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Hawthorne
...The way things are going, they probably won't last another ten years. At worst, both could collapse.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Hawthorne
So the heads of both families arrived at the same conclusion. They would need to form an alliance...a merger of sorts.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
They needed a way to ensure neither would betray the other...and they decided the way to do that was to have their oldest children marry.
[k]

？1：So it's a political marriage?

？！

＠Hawthorne
Yes, that's probably the best way to put it.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Hawthorne
I'm still a bachelor myself,[sr]but I care for those girls as if they were my own.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Hawthorne
Sometimes, I can't help but wish Juliet[sr]was as free-spirited as her mother.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
She agreed to a marriage she doesn't want, purely to help her family. It really grinds my gears.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
And to make matters worse... Well, you've met Morris.[sr]How do YOU think he will be as a husband?
[k]

？1：Uh...
？2：...I think he'll make Juliet very unhappy.

？！

[charaFace B 0]

＠Hawthorne
I concur. Morris is no more than a thug who goes about picking fights over every perceived slight to his fragile ego. And he perceives...many.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Hawthorne
Unfortunately, he's not the only one like that[sr]in the Goldie and Violet families. Far from it.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Hawthorne
And those other thugs aren't happy about this merger. They're too concerned with what happened in the past and what's happening right now to give any thought to the future.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
In fact, many of them would rather have[sr]an all-out war than team up with an enemy.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
Both Aaron and Adamska are under a lot of pressure from their men not to go through with this.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
That's why Aaron decided to bring in the Marble Company. Any deal the Marble Company is present for always goes through, after all.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
Nobody in that city would voice an objection to this engagement with the Marble Company backing it.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
...While this is ostensibly a four-day family trip, the true purpose here is to close the deal between these two families in secret.
[k]

？1：...That's terrible.
？2：(But then, why am I here...?)

？！

[charaFace B 4]

＠Hawthorne
Of course, she has every right to go ahead with this marriage if that's what she's decided, but I don't want her to make a choice she'll end up regretting.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Hawthorne
Still, she has many years ahead of her, and there's no telling what may happen down life's winding road.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Hawthorne
If Juliet ever ends up reaching out to you[sr]for help, I hope you will be there for her.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
Not that I have any business telling you this, as I did not even have the guts to take a chance to get properly turned down by my own youthful crush.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Hawthorne
Now then, we'd better get back.[sr]I imagine Juliet is waiting for us with our tea.

I do beg your pardon, but I'm trying to think.[sr]Would you kindly keep it down?

[charaFace C 4]

＠Holmes
...Still, I must say, I'm disappointed to hear the detective was the first to step off the stage.
[k]

＠Holmes
Detective work is fraught with danger. Any gentleman worth his salt should have known to master a martial art or two for his own self-defense. Poor Sheringham clearly needed more training.

You're one to talk, given that your self-defense consists of shielding yourself with the culprit.

＠Professor M
That aside, something about Sheringham's death nags at me. It would make more sense had it been anyone else.
[k]

？1：Hm? What do you mean, Professor?
？！
[charaFace B 0]

＠Professor M
Assuming that whoever made the threat is among the other characters, Sheringham's arrival must have thrown a wrench in their plans.
[k]

＠Professor M
Let's further assume that the culprit made[sr]a number of preparations in the Kogetsukan.
[k]

＠Professor M
Assuming they have done so, then murdering Sheringham puts our culprit in a bit of a bind, since they had not prepared anything for him in advance.
[k]

＠Professor M
Which means they must have made a mistake somewhere.
[k]

＠Professor M
I certainly understand the desire to rid oneself of an unwelcome visitor, but I can't say I approve of this rushed, artless approach.

＠Professor M
As soon as someone dies, the survivors become much more wary, serving only to complicate the act of carrying out your intended murder.
[k]

＠Professor M
Assuming this is not a matter of vengeance, your first victim should always be the one you had intended to kill from the start.
[k]

＠Professor M
But that wasn't true for Sheringham.[sr]He was not involved with either of the families.
[k]

＠Professor M
Killing him now must have been a deeply[sr]bitter pill for the culprit to swallow.

Believe me, I can understand how they felt! If an unbearably smug-looking detective showed up like he was running the show amid one of my own schemes, I'd want to send him home in a coffin too!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Professor M
The detective's presence carries with it the risk of interference in the culprit's plans, or having them exposed once those plans are carried out.
[k]

＠Professor M
Detectives represent any number of problems for criminals, you know! Disposing of them before the plot truly begins is absolutely the best course.

Furthermore, by killing the detective off first, the person who made the threat has shown they are not afraid to get their hands dirty.

Come to think of it, there was a new development on our end while you were off in dreamland, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].

I wasn't able to track down the Marble Company...

＠Holmes
...but I did find two other corporations[sr]named Goldie Company and Violet Inc.
[k]

＠Holmes
They are both headquartered in a major American city, and have vied for control over it for quite some time.

＠Holmes
The CEOs of the two companies are listed as Aaron Goldie and Adamska Violet. It all lines up perfectly.
