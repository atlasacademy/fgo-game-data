I daresay the path to the warehouse where your vehicles are being kept is as good as secured.

Of course, you still have to dig your way there, and there may well be more unexpected trouble along the way.

So I think I'll go ahead and take advantage of those tunnels you've all been digging and make my own escape without anyone being the wiser.
