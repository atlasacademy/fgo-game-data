＠Diarmuid
My apologies... I was at a loss for words... I am greatly humbled by your gracious gesture, my [&lord:lady].
[k]

＠Diarmuid
But you must have many subjects other than me.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Diarmuid
Yet to receive such a gift... To be the only person to receive such affection pains me somewhat.
[k]

？1：You don't want them?
？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Diarmuid
No! Absolutely not!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Diarmuid
But my personal feelings aside, to be singled out among all the other Heroic Spirits...this is somewhat...
[k]

＠Diarmuid
For example...and this is only an example...[sr]If word of this interaction reaches my king...
[k]

？1：You don't need to overthink this!

＠Diarmuid
Huh? Really?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Diarmuid
...I see. Today must be a day where anyone is permitted to convey their feelings in ways like this. So this is the custom.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
Ah, what a wonderful age this is! I am so very happy to have a chance to see for myself how the times have changed.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Diarmuid
That alone makes me grateful to have been summoned as a Servant.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
And now, I shall give you this as a token of my gratitude.

As a proud knight, I, Diarmuid, shall finish this chocolate alone!

Even if it means giving my life! Even if a fierce battle should ensue, I will protect it with all my being!

？1：No, listen...
