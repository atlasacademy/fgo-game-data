I'm the last tenant? I see![sr]But I got a chance to appear, so I'm not complaining!

＠Heroine X
What's that!? Is it a bird? Is it a plane?[sr]No, it's a Saber!

＠Heroine X
That's right, I'm the Saber who races across the glistening etheric universe!

Mmm! Following a highly concentrated Saber signal has led me to a new Saber!

＠Heroine X
I have nothing against you personally, but I have a quota. A quota of Sabers to fight!

＠Heroine X
Ah, no, my mistake. That's actually karma. It's my karma. That's cool. I'm a character ruled by fate.

Huh? Who's this in a kimono with a Japanese sword? She's so serious and menacing...

＠Heroine X
All right, I apologize. I had the wrong person![sr]Can you just let me go home?
