Fou, kyaau?
[k]


[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...I can't contact Chaldea's control room. So the doctor[sr]can't analyze our situation or bring us back.
[k]

＠Mash
One possibility is... That this is a type of shared memory[sr]between the Servant and the Master... A type of dream.

I may be different than you.[sr]...[charaFace A 12]That makes me a little sad.

You are inside a dream, sharing a memory of an[sr]intense experience you both had.

...Something seems very different somehow...
[k]

＠Mash
You're not one of the Servants we saw in Fuyuki...[sr]Not only that, but I don't think
[k]

＠Mash
we've ever met you before.[sr]I don't...think so, anyway. My memory's hazy...

It's been 2,000 years since I've shown myself to anyone.[sr]We couldn't have met.
[k]

＠???
...If you said you had seen me,[sr]then we'd have a bit of a problem.
[k]

＠???
You're not an escapee from my realm, are you?[sr]You're not a ghost either, correct?
[k]


[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...We're not ghost-type monsters, no.[sr]But, you said 2,000 years, right?
[k]

＠Mash
That would be around the birth of Christ...[sr]Do you mean that's when you were alive?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠???
Hmm, I feel a passionate gaze upon me.
[k]

＠???
Oh, it's not me, but my spear you're looking at?[sr]It's good that you can assess weapons at your age.
[k]

＠???
But this isn't what you are expecting. It's not a Divine[sr]Construct, forged by The Sea God, Manannan.
[k]

＠???
Sadly, it's just a spear.[sr]A stick, made from the skeleton of a sea creature.
[k]

＠???
...Or perhaps you were pretending to look at the spear,[sr]but were actually looking at me?
[k]

＠???
Heheh. You've never met an Ulster woman, have you?

＠???
Hmm. How should I put this?[sr]Thinking back, I haven't given many people my name.
[k]

＠???
The warriors knew my name when they visited my home.[sr]The beasts and fallen gods challenged me out of fear.
[k]

＠???
They all feared me because[sr]they knew who I was.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠???
It's been a long time since you[line 3]no, people like you[sr]have asked me what my name is without prejudice.
[k]

＠???
And so I have no choice but to answer honestly.
[k]

＠???
I am a being which exists outside the world.
[k]

＠???
Something which was to exist forever,[sr]without getting old or dying.
[k]

＠???
My name is Scáthach, the ruler of Dún Scáith, the Land[sr]of Shadows. Although it does make me a little uncomfortable announcing it like that.

Scáthach! The god-killing superhuman who's said to[sr]practically be a divinity herself?

？！

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes, Senpai! She's mentioned in the Celtic myths of the[sr]first century, particularly the Ulster Cycle!
[k]

＠Mash
An invincible warrior, the ruler of a supernatural realm[sr]similar to the underworld. She even trained the great hero Cú Chulainn!
[k]

＠Mash
And she's also a "great magus," one of the best ever...[sr]But she shouldn't "exist in the Throne of Heroes," so [charaFace A 6]why!?
[k]

？1：Doesn't exist in the Throne of Heroes?
？2：You mean she can't be a Servant?

[charaFace A 3]

Huh? Oh, right.[sr]Thank you very much.
[k]


[charaFace D 1]
＠Scáthach
It's all right. In your case, it's more effective to speak[sr]quietly. Keep it all within you, and be like a silent burning flame.

[charaFace D 5]
＠Scáthach
...Sorry, that's an old habit of mine.[sr]We don't have time for long chats.

As Mash said, I was never meant to be here.[sr]Since I retired from the battlefields.

＠Scáthach
I won't get into too much of[sr]why I've been summoned, but[line 2]
[k]

＠Scáthach
I've shown myself for a good reason.[sr]To solve the problem occurring within this dream.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Master of Chaldea and you, new Servant,[sr]calm yourselves and open your eyes.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Witness what was brought forth by all the abnormality.[sr]Something is out of the ordinary here.
