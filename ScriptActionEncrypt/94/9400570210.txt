＠Mash
Senpai, did you know?[sr]The amount of water a human needs each day is 3 liters.
[k]

＠Mash
Actually, since we are in this blazing tropical heat, you should drink more.
[k]

？1：You're well-informed, Mash.
？2：I think you're being overly serious...
？！

＠Mash
Hydration is important. It's a life-threatening matter, so please be more aware of it.
[k]

＠Mash
We've been collecting rainwater and drawing water from different places. However, I'm starting to think it's all a bit inefficient, so...
[k]


＠Mash
I've discussed the matter with Scáthach.

＠Scáthach
Mm, she has indeed. For now, we've decided to create a watering place somewhere.
[k]

＠Scáthach
It'll be a place to preserve fresh water.[sr]My runes will help in the process too.
[k]

＠Scáthach
What we need Master to decide is its shape.

A watering place...the obvious shape would be a well.[sr]It should be easy to make it with wood.

A well is fine, but wouldn't the wood rot? I think it would be more durable if it were built with bricks.
[k]

＠Martha
And it would look nice too.

Water is important. I agree with Mash.
[k]

＠Anne
Of course. Water is your lifeline out at sea.
[k]

＠Anne
Once it runs out, all you can do is pray.[sr]Either wait till you die or it rains.

＠Mary
So here's my suggestion. A watering place needs to be practical. It needs to be in the most practical shape. Which means...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Anne
A faucet would be good☆
[k]


？1：...!?
？！

[charaFace F 3]
＠Mary
I've been impressed by it ever since I've been at Chaldea.
[k]

＠Mary
If you turn on the faucet, water flows out.[sr]It's such an amazing system.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Anne
Goodness. If a faucet had been installed on our ship,
[k]

＠Anne
maybe those ugly mutinies and water disputes would have never occurred...

We will be using it for a long time, so wouldn't a brick well be the most versatile choice?

By the way, I heard a rumor...

...that there's a faucet somewhere that pours out[sr]orange juice.

[charaFace D 3]
＠Anne
I've even heard there's one that pours udon broth[sr]from[line 2]
