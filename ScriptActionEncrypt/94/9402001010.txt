For my part, I have no objections to this latest mission. I'll carry it out quickly and quietly, just as planned.

Anyway, here's the biryani, sambal, and tandoori chicken you asked me to prepare, Archer.

[charaFace C 0]

＠Emiya
I think you might have the wrong idea.[sr]Let's make sure we're all on the same page first.
[k]

＠Emiya
We're here to throw you a welcome party.[sr]Shuten-Douji asked us to put it together.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠General Setsubun
D-did you say a welcome party? For me!?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Emiya
That's right. I accepted her request 'cause it[sr]didn't look like she had any ulterior motives.
[k]

＠Emiya
I'm guessing that's true for all the other[sr]Servants you've met along the way too.
[k]

＠Emiya
With the exception of the scam artist[sr]and the poor sap following him around...
[k]

＠Emiya
...I'm pretty sure everyone in this tower[line 2]hell, even the tower itself[line 2]wanted you to have a good time and make your stay here a memorable one.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠General Setsubun
...
[k]

＠General Setsubun
But, then... Why would those oni go to all the[sr]trouble of making a tower THIS enormous...?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Emiya
Sorry, I can't speak to that. No one is ever[sr]really sure what Shuten-Douji is thinking.
[k]

＠Emiya
She's always played her cards pretty close to the chest.
[k]

＠Emiya
But, at least this time,[sr]her request was clear and convincing.
[k]

＠Emiya
You're a Heroic Spirit from Japan. The idea of looking over your old homeland from an unbeatable view, all while enjoying gourmet food...
[k]

＠Emiya
Well, it sounded like a pretty[sr]perfect welcome party to me.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠General Setsubun
...I did notice that the guards we've encountered have demonstrated neither animosity toward me nor any particular loyalty toward Shuten-Douji.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
I believe each of them agreed to[sr]help her for their own reasons.

＠General Setsubun
Despite my young age, I have the honor of being entrusted with the role of general, and the task of dismantling this tower before it can transform into a Singularity.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
Right now, completing that task is my highest priority. How I do so, and how I feel about it, are secondary at best.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
I cannot stop here. I must continue on to the top floor and face the oni behind this, Shuten-Douji...
[k]

＠General Setsubun
Everything else is merely secondary.

You really take your job seriously, huh.[sr]I'll admit that this is a pretty rough way to throw a party.
[k]

＠Emiya
Personally, since I know exactly what Shuten's goal is, I'm not at all worried about it turning into a Singularity.
[k]

＠Emiya
Once this is all done, I'm pretty sure[sr]she'll get rid of the tower on her own.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Emiya
That said, I guess it was inevitable...
[k]

＠Emiya
...that you'd need to see her for yourself to find out if she's serious about this or not.

[charaFace E 3]

＠Boudica
Oh, but that doesn't mean you HAVE to stay and eat it, of course. Kids always do want to run off and play without knowing how much work went into the food on their table.

Or to fill up on snacks to the point where they're not even hungry for dinner, like Ex here.

The sugar has reached my Altereactor, but as I suspected, sesame dumplings are not true Japanese sweets, even if they are made with sweet bean paste.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

No more appetizers. Give me all the sweetest sweets you have. I'll make them my five-course meal of cola, cream pastries, cake, ice cream, and churros.

If you insist on turning your back on this feast we've made for you...then you'd better be prepared to fight your way past us!
