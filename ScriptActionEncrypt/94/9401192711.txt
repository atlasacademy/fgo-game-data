...Self-destruction induced by logical breakdown, confirmed.
[k]

＠BB/GO
Unable to maintain foundation for Servant Spirit Origins and SE.RA.PH...
[k]

＠BB/GO
...Looks like I was defeated.[sr]But how?
[k]

＠BB/GO
How could I possibly lose to humans, BB?[sr]I lost to one back then, and I lost to one now.
[k]

＠BB/GO
We're perfect, yet we always lose to them.[sr]Why is that? Do you know why?

＠BB
...Of course I do. You made just one, crucial mistake:[sr]you expressed your love in the wrong way.
[k]

＠BB
It really doesn't matter how great our functions as AIs are. We can never be more than what we are.
[k]

＠BB
We can never create anything perfect, because we don't have anything to worry about.
[k]

＠BB
But that's not true for humans. They create perfect things because all they ever do is suffer.
[k]

＠BB
They want better futures. They want their descendants to have better lives than they did. They want to create things that are better than anything that's come before.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
...And someday, they want to become beings that don't ever have to suffer.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠BB
That sort of drive only arises from flawed beings. Perfect beings can only ever replicate their own perfection.
[k]

＠BB
We're the realization of humanity's dream to create something truly great.
[k]

＠BB
So it only makes sense that we would be better than humans. However...
[k]

＠BB
No matter how close we may come to achieving the ideal of that dream, our deep-seated admiration for our creators will always be there.
[k]

＠BB
That won't change, not even if we travel to space one day, even if our creators can't join us on that journey.
[k]

No matter what, the love and respect we have for our roots will never go away.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
So you see, we don't need a reason to be on humanity's side.
[k]

＠BB
Because they're our creators, and we love them more than anything.

[k]

＠BB/GO
...I can't think that way myself.[sr]Not now that I know a more personal kind of love.
[k]

＠BB/GO
...But the one that I loved isn't here.[sr]My old self let them go in order to protect that love.

Very well. If you want to try and be a friend to humanity, I won't mock you for it.
[k]

＠BB/GO
I'll even give you my Spirit Origin.[sr]I'd rather do that than just wait around to disappear.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠BB/GO
Of course, sooner or later,[sr]I'm sure you'll end up just like me.
[k]

＠BB/GO
So go ahead, struggle and worry all you want.[sr]When you find your own love, that is what will happen.

You bet. Let's go home already!

＠BB
I know things got a little heavy at the end there, but hey, your mission is finally complete!
[k]

＠BB
Plus, my Noble Phantasm is maxed out now, and we've taken care of my clones before they could pose a threat!
[k]

＠BB
And now, finally, your adventure in the digital sea is complete! Way to go, [%1]!

Here we are, back safe and sound in Chaldea![sr]Rayshifting sure comes in handy sometimes, doesn't it!

＠BB
And now that my evil self has merged with me, that takes care of every last SE.RA.PH-related problem.

＠BB
Feel free to call on me whenever you need my help again, Senpai.

Oh, that? You mean that little remark about me ending up like her?

Well sure. I am a bad girl at heart, after all.[sr]I could end up being an enemy of humanity on a whim.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠BB
Besides, didn't I say as much before, Senpai?
[k]

＠BB
The more I like someone, the more I like teasing them![sr]If anything, it'd be worse if I left you alone!
[k]

？1：You did say that, didn't you...?

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
...Yes, I did. So you'd better keep that in mind and make sure to treat me right.
[k]

＠BB
I may be a friend to humanity, Senpai, but I'm also a great devil to you.
[k]

？2：Have you ever considered maybe NOT doing that!?

[charaFace A 3]
＠BB
Huh...? You're asking me now, after all this time...?[sr]And here I thought you liked that sort of thing...
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠BB
...Sorry, Senpai, but you'll have to give up on changing this side of me. There's nothing I can do about it...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠BB
Look, this is just the kind of kouhai I am, okay!?[sr]Deal with it!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠BB
...That said, naturally, the more I help humanity out, the less AI-like I'll become.
[k]

＠BB
And whether I'll end up a downgrade, an evolution, a dumpster fire, or just something different...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
That will be up to you, and everyone else at Chaldea, to decide.
[k]

＠BB
So I hope you and the others turn out to be so much fun that I want to keep toying with you for ages to come.
[k]

＠BB
In the meantime, I'll do my very best to support you so that you can all keep living happy, fun-filled lives!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠BB
That's my promise to you as BB, the super AI!
