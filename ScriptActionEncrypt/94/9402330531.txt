＠Sieg
That's right. I think you've all been summoned from the records leading up to it.
[k]

＠Sieg
Usually, your memories would be engraved in the Throne of Heroes, but the versions of you here right now are not actually complete.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Sieg
Alternatively, someone might have sealed them away on purpose. Perhaps whoever is orchestrating all this.
[k]

＠Siegfried
I'm told you still have your memories of the war, Sir Custodian. If that's true, I have a question for you...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Sieg
Of course.[sr]...Anything.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Siegfried
Did I stay true to myself?
[k]

...[sr]...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Sieg
I... I'm afraid I can't answer that.

What is it, Master of Chaldea?[sr]You look terribly embarrassed.

[charaFace F 1]

An apology?

＠Siegfried
Hmm, I don't know what it is you are sorry for...[sr]But I promise you, I'm fine. You needn't worry about me.

You are a Master, a crystallization of the future.

I, uh, I see.

So Siegfried fought a different Fafnir in Orleans...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Sieg
...Don't worry, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Sieg
I'm sure he meant it when he said he never wanted to fight a battle like that again...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Sieg
...but I doubt a hero like him would let something like that stop him from stepping up when he's needed.
[k]

＠Sieg
I'm sure he'll do whatever he has to.[sr]All the more so if the fate of humanity is at stake.
[k]

＠Sieg
After all, he's the sort of man who would risk[sr]his life just to save a homunculus like me...
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Sieg
He even put me ahead of his own desires,[sr]and those of the person he had pledged to fight.
[k]

＠Sieg
He ended up throwing all that away, because of me.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Sieg
I don't regret doing what I had to do to survive.[sr]But, I guess...
[k]

＠Sieg
...Hmm, it's hard to explain.
[k]

＠Sieg
I wanted to survive, and I want[sr]Siegfried to continue fighting.
[k]

[charaFace D 8]
＠Sieg
I feel like those two desires contradict each other,[sr]but then again, maybe they don't...?
[k]

？1：Do you feel guilty or something?
？！

[charaFace D 6]
＠Sieg
...Yes, I suppose I do.
[k]

＠Sieg
After I became the Greater Grail's Custodian, I learned a lot of things I would have been happier not knowing.
[k]

＠Sieg
Among them were things that happened without me having been aware at the time.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Sieg
...The last Servant Atalante fought was Achilles.
[k]

＠Sieg
Frankenstein was forced to use her Noble Phantasm's full power when she fought with Mordred, even though she knew doing so would be suicide.
[k]

＠Sieg
And...a great hero like Siegfried gave up his heart, all to save my life.
[k]

＠Sieg
They fought long and hard to acquire the Holy Grail.[sr]All of their wishes were pure and righteous.
[k]

＠Sieg
But in the end, I was the one who ended up with the Greater Grail.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Sieg
...Ever since then, I've been wondering[sr]whether I did the right thing or not.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Sieg
What would you have done? Would you have been able to accept a wish like that, and allowed the Greater Grail to grant it?
[k]

＠Sieg
Or would you have made the same choice I did?
[k]

＠Sieg
Or...would you have taken another option?[sr]One I didn't see at the time...?
[k]

？1：I'd have had to be there myself.
？2：That's really hard to say.
？！

[charaFace D 6]
＠Sieg
Right. That makes sense.
[k]

＠Sieg
...[sr]...Hm?
[k]

[charaFace D 8]
＠Sieg
That's weird. It's not as though my[sr]problem has been resolved, but...
[k]

＠Sieg
...for some reason, I feel a bit better now.
[k]

？1：Maybe you just needed to talk about it?
？！

[charaFace D 6]
＠Sieg
...That could be it.
[k]

＠Sieg
It's hard to repress the urge to talk. Maybe that's not so surprising, since I've manifested as a terminal.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Sieg
We still have some time before we leave for the Hanging Gardens. Would it be okay if we talk a little more?
[k]

？1：Of course!

But even if you fall,[sr]I'm sure one of the heroes will save you.
