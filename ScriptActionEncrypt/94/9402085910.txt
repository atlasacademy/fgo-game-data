＠???
The next thing my Fluffy Master realized,[sr]it was December 24.
[k]

＠???
Surprised? There's really nothing to be surprised about. Even if it's Valentine's Day, there are times when Christmas still wins.
[k]

＠???
Sometimes a nice fantastical situation like this is good civilization, or so the still-cold Santa thought.
[k]

？1：That voice...
？2：San(ta)!

？！

＠Altera Santa
Ho ho ho.[sr]Merry Valentine's Day, young one.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Altera Santa
Hehe. This is just another way to use Zerco.[sr]No other Santa could manage a trick like this.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Altera Santa
How have you been, Master?[sr]You did an excellent job during Christmas.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
The 24th turned out to be ridiculously busy. I had to go and visit every single village and city in the world[line 2]and all in one night!
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Altera Santa
Some people were not home, some addresses were wrong, some even cried and claimed they got the wrong gift. Often I would accidentally hit my own head with my candy cane...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Altera Santa
...Yes. But it was still a lot of fun.[sr]I'd love to distribute presents with you again someday.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Anyway, if I kept on going down memory lane,[sr]the sun would surely set before I finished.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Altera Santa
Today I'm here to deliver a present to you.[sr]Not, uh, as Santa...but as myself.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I secretly set this aside on Christmas Day.[sr]I... I hope you like it.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Y-yeah. Giving a gift to you directly[sr]like this makes my face warm.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I learned something new today. I'm a bit uncomfortable, so I'll have to make this a one-time-only thing.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Altera Santa
I heard that, to [&gentlemen:ladies] of a certain age, eating an entire cake on their own is the ultimate indulgence.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
So fill that grinning face of yours with cake.[sr]You're sure to have a good dream tonight.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Altera Santa
And now I'll be off. Altera Santa can[sr]only be on Earth for three minutes! (Turns)
[k]

？1：Let's eat it together. You know you're in a dream, right?

？！

[charaFace A 2]

＠Altera Santa
(Gasp!) Now that you mention it!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Altera Santa
You really are smart. And kind.[sr]...Okay, I shall take a bite too.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Altera Santa
Heh. I'm sure it's good. I can guarantee that much.[sr]After all, I personally chose this one over all the others because it looked the best.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
But be careful not to eat too much of it; you could get a stomachache. I'm talking from experience...
[k]
