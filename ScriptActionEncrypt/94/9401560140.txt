I see. If Miss Bunyan did have her favorite axe, she could open up this forest to create a path for us.

But the person who summoned me took my axe away...

Indeed! The pioneers all started out in small shacks and eventually built their own world!

Just like me! I started out in a small, poor lab, but eventually expanded into a giant corporation!

What are your hands for!?[sr]What are your arms for!?

＠Edison
Yes! To build your future! Don't hesitate! Break through! Fight it! And if you can't fight it, sue it!
