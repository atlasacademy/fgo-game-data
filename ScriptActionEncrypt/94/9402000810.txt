But I was just happy because I thought it meant you were finally accepting bats as part of my character!

Now, now, don't you think this is a lovely place for a party? It was only three thousand yen to rent it out for half a day, AND it's got an open bar and Wi-Fi.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Plus, we have a full menu of goodies thanks to that deal we made with Emiya's Kitchen! We didn't even need to ask Benienma for help.

[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
And that means everyone is welcome, and anyone who wants to leave has to pay their fair share.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Now that you're here, you're to enjoy our discussions, Pocky games, and sultriness until your head spins.

Of course, that goes for you just as much as Master, uh...General Setsubun, was it?

[charaFace A 4]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
This is nothing less than our respective lives crashing into each other with full force.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
It is a battle none of us can afford to lose, while also being an endless collaborative exchange of information...
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
We call it the Deadly Spider Lily[sr]Romance Talk Murder Party!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Girls' nights out are practically defined by tales of romance! It is a precarious, unavoidable gauntlet, but also a flower that blooms beautifully when nurtured!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Of course, at times, this flower can be so intensely hot that both sides end up getting injured and watching its petals wilt away, but such are the risks we take for love.

Okay, I don't feel great about doing this,[sr]but let me ask you too, Master...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Don't you think it's juuust a bit unhealthy and even kind of morbid for a widow to spend all her time playing video games whose point is just to murder people?

There is nothing morbid about me playing the games of video! In fact, grinding my opponents to dust always puts a smile on my face!
