＠Mecha Eli-chan
My motion sensors have detected something.[sr]...Hmph. So they're finally here, it seems.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
[%1], the Master of Chaldea, as well as Csejte's former ruler, and Osakabehime.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
I know to treat Elisabeth and Osakabehime as the trivial threats they are, but the Master is another matter...
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
I still haven't observed [&him:her] enough to know what [&his:her][sr]alignment is.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
It would be foolish to attempt to assess an opponent without information. I should at least have a brief conversation with [&him:her] before we fight.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
...Imagine, me speaking with a commoner as equals. Certainly Elisabeth could never have done that in life.

Well, I suppose I can play that part by ear.[sr]I am an expert at the hands-on approach, after all.

The word “robot” comes from a play called “Rossum's Universal Robots” written by Karel Čapek, a Czechoslovakian novelist.
[k]

＠Mash
It has all kinds of uses today, so people tend to forget its original meaning...

That's right. I can't remember why I originally thought to become an idol...
[k]

＠Elisabeth
...but I do know that a job whose sole purpose was to bask in the love and adoration of people everywhere never existed in my own time.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
It's no exaggeration to say learning about idols saved my life. Once I did, I knew that was my calling.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
I really believe it's the greatest job in existence; one that's worth clawing my way to the top for.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

...Which is why it's so strange.

＠Elisabeth
As a Heroic Spirit, I'm not restricted to just being a high-ranking lady anymore.

I still am one, of course, but I'm also my people's idol, there to bring joy to their lives.

Otherwise, I couldn't even manifest in this form.[charaFace D 4][sr]But Mecha Eli-chan's more, well...

She's more “me.” I mean, the me I used to be. More innocent, back when all I knew was obligation and duty.
