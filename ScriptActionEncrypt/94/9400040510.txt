Oh?
[k]

？1：Huh?

？！

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
These...appear to be the hills of France...
[k]

＠Mash
But what are we doing here?[sr]We were gathering rare dumplings...
[k]

＠???
Hehehe. I'll tell you, Mash.
[k]

＠???
“Thank you for all the work you've done for me and Orion. Good job, you two!”

Just kidding![sr]Good evening, Master of Chaldea.

＠Orion
Hey, how've you been, Mash♡ It's a bit late, but[sr]do you need an introduction and explanation?
[k]

？1：Yeah, I think we kind of do.

＠Orion
Hehe. Soft on the outside, and prickly where it counts.[sr]I like it.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Orion
All right, time to explain![sr]I was the one who attacked Chaldea's food supply!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Orion
Or at least, that was the plan.[sr]But it didn't work.
[k]

＠Orion
Um, I virtually proved the causality of being summoned[sr]by you, and managed to get into Chaldea,
[k]

＠Orion
but then it was just one failure after another.[sr]Lots of nasty traps kept me out of the storage.
[k]

＠Orion
All I could do was transport your entire[sr]storage into the Singularity.
[k]

＠Orion
And once I'd done that, I jumped to retrieve them, but...
[k]

＠Orion
By an unfortunate coincidence, a passing queen[sr]got to them before I could.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Orion
You know the rest.[sr]I chased after the dumplings,
[k]

＠Orion
gathered almost enough rare dumplings for the special Craft Essence, and waited for the time of my full revival!
[k]

？2：No, I think we're good.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Orion
R-Really?[sr]Hmm, you don't need an explanation, huh?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Orion
But, that's fine. It makes this easier.[sr]All that's left to do is fight.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
So you were the real culprit?[sr]But why?
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
[charaFace B 1]
＠Orion
For the dumplings, of course.[sr]The dumplings.
[k]

＠Orion
The dumplings are a manifestation of faith, created for[sr]the moon... An offering to the moon.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Orion
Do you understand? They're a way to win[sr]the favor of the gods and bring them here.
[k]

＠Orion
Even if Chaldea didn't intend for it to happen, doing[sr]a ritual like that in a place with a summoning system...
[k]

＠Orion
...was enough for me to awaken.[sr]More specifically, it slapped me awake.
[k]

＠Orion
But when I woke up, I was starving.[sr]I didn't have nearly enough magical energy.
[k]

＠Orion
So I wanted dumplings.[sr]The sacrifices that were created for me.
[k]

＠Orion
They are thoughts, created for me.[sr]A rare source of magical energy that exists to feed me.

Then[line 3]for the last few days Senpai and I[sr]have been running around to try and revive you!?

[charaFace B 1]
＠Orion
That's right♡[sr]But please don't treat me as evil or anything.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Orion
I'm on your side...well, I'm not.[sr]But, I'm not your enemy.
[k]

＠Orion
If my darling is on your side, then I'm willing to be, too.
[k]

＠Orion
Anyway, thanks to all the rare dumplings that [%1] found, I can join your other Servants.
[k]

＠Orion
All that's left is to wait for you to summon me[line 3][sr]But first, don't you think we need to test your skills?
[k]

？1：[&Agreed. You'll pay for tricking me.:Agreed. you're going to regret this.]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Orion
Hmm... I guess you're right.[sr]I didn't trick you, but it is true that I was having fun...
[k]

？2：Can we talk instead of fight?

[charaFace B 1]
＠Orion
Impossible. I don't like humans to start with.[sr]And I dislike the weak ones the most.
[k]

＠Orion
So I want you to show me that you're strong enough to beat selfish, unreasonable, and inhuman old me.
[k]

＠Orion
Otherwise, you can't handle a Servant like me.
[k]

？！

Sigh...I figured it would end like this.

＠Mash
But I was kind of ready for it, so it's fine!
[k]

＠Mash
Mash Kyrielight[line 3] Ready to go, Master!
[k]

？1：Right! Let's beat this goddess, Mash!

＠Orion
That's the spirit![sr]Let me reintroduce myself then.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Orion
I am the deity of moonlight, the elegant representation of purity, virginity, hunting, and eternity[line 3]
[k]

＠Orion
One of the ancient gods of Mt. Olympus![sr]I, the Moon Goddess Artemis, shall test you!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Orion
I hope you do well. Try and beat me, just like my darling did that day♡
