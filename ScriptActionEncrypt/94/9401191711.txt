There won't be any victor or Holy Grail if SE.RA.PH itself falls apart, after all. So, I'ma just kill you all off, go find that Archer, and[line 2]

Oh yes [&he:she] does. I don't know what's going on in that little fox head of yours, but you're acting exactly as though BB were pulling your strings.

You don't have a Master, a wish, or even a future happy household plan.

Of course Master would feel sorry for you.

＠Suzuka Gozen
BB and the Demon God Pillar have nothing to do with it.[sr]I belong to the Master who summoned me.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
...I heard a voice when I was summoned here.[sr]It was faint, but I still heard it.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
It said they wanted to win.[sr]That they didn't want to die for nothing.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Whoever it was didn't expect anyone to hear them. It was just the kind of thing humans say whenever they realize they're about to die.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]
＠Suzuka Gozen
I'm going to grant their wish. I don't know them, or if they're even still alive, but they called to me.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
It took every last bit of strength they had, but they called to me.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
I don't know their name, and they didn't know mine, but they still entrusted me with their final wish. The most human kind of wish anyone could make!
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠Suzuka Gozen
So I HAVE to win this Holy Grail War for them!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
If I ran away after hearing a wish like that, I could never face myself again!
