＠Holmes
[&Mr.:Ms.] [%1]. In your dream, you said you were being cared for by an unfamiliar girl named Juliet.
[k]

＠Holmes
Furthermore, you were staying at an unfamiliar Western-style mansion rather than Chaldea, along with two families.
[k]

＠Holmes
These families were made up of familiar Servants, but all of their names and some of their genders were different. Is that correct?
[k]

？1：Yes. It was really confusing.

？！

＠Holmes
That is far too intricate to be an ordinary dream. For one thing, did you even know the word “kogetsu” beforehand?
[k]

？1：No, I didn't.
？2：Isn't it some kind of old-fashioned word...?

According to the dictionary, it's an old Japanese[sr]word for “crescent moon.” [wt 0.8][charaFace A 1]A lot of Western-style country houses are given similarly old-fashioned names.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

In fact, I think they should have names like that.[sr]The Kogetsukan sounds like a wonderful name to me!

＠Professor M
Hmm. You mean the phenomenon of learning a word through a dream that one would have no way of knowing otherwise?
[k]

＠Professor M
In the magecraft world, there are no shortage of methods to accomplish that. Precognitive dreams... Clairvoyance... The remote sharing of minds...
[k]

＠Holmes
Indeed. This latest case may be[sr]the result of one such method...
[k]

＠Holmes
Given what we currently know, my hypothesis is that[sr][&Mr.:Ms.] [%1] is picking up a signal of sorts...
[k]

＠Holmes
...a signal originating from one who is witnessing these events in reality.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Professor M
Yes... I imagine it is something along those lines.[sr]How unfortunate for young [%1].

We don't know who's broadcasting it, but you[sr]seem to have unwittingly tuned in, so to speak.
[k]

＠Professor M
However, humans contain quite a lot of data. How they sound, how their skin feels, their expressions... A wealth of information.
[k]

＠Professor M
This was likely too much information for you to process about so many people, so your mind substituted familiar Servants for these new faces.
[k]

＠Professor M
Think of it as a kind of safety function. Were you unable to do so, your mind may well have broken under the strain of so much data.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Professor M
It is a very real danger. Indeed, your subconscious mind assessed the situation far more quickly and accurately than your conscious one.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Professor M
That is to say...this was not your last dream.[sr]This story will continue on!

Now, permit this old professor to give you a word of advice. There is a certain malevolence present in the situation and relationships you described...

＠Holmes
...[&Mr.:Ms.] [%1], allow me a word of advice as well, while there is still time to offer it.
[k]

＠Holmes
Consider... Why did your brain choose to substitute Mordred for Morris?
[k]

＠Holmes
Simple. It did so in error. It merely assigned Mordred to him based on his violent disposition.
[k]

＠Holmes
It is a stark difference between what you know and the events you are witnessing.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]

＠Holmes
As such, there may be other errors of a similar nature.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Holmes
Listen closely. You cannot take what you see at face value. That is absolutely crucial.
[k]

＠Holmes
Think carefully, and act cautiously. Once you are back in this dream, we will be powerless to help you.

＠Holmes
This dream is someone else's reality.[sr]As long as you are experiencing it, you ARE that person.

I don't want to scare you, but if you die in this dream, we cannot say what may happen to you here.
