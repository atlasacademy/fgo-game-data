Now that was an easy fight, I couldn't even remember[sr]what they looked like. I guess they weren't that tough, huh?

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
Now, tell me, [%1].[sr]What did those enemies look like to you?

We've fought them several times before...[sr]Did they look different to you, Scáthach?
[k]


[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
They looked like a smoky haze.[sr]To me, they seemed to barely exist.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Scáthach
And that's because,[sr]not once have I perceived the idea of death.

Death?
[k]


[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
Indeed. What you're seeing isn't[sr]memories of your past...
[k]

＠Scáthach
...Nor some kind of symbolism from your dreams.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Those are remnants left behind of a miserable death.[sr]They should not exist within you at all.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Scáthach
To be more precise, they are[sr]the "remnants left behind even by death."
[k]

＠Scáthach
These flames you see.[sr]The ones you fought.
[k]

＠Scáthach
They are the remnants left behind by the death[sr]you witnessed as you fought to protect humanity.
[k]

＠Scáthach
There were many others around.[sr]Ten thousand or so moving corpses and skeletons.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Scáthach
But I took care of all of them. They weren't worth[sr]teaching anything. They were far too weak.
[k]


[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
T-Ten thousand?
[k]


[charaFace D 1]
＠Scáthach
Hahaha, I'm pleased that you're surprised,[sr]but you could've just laughed it off, Mash.
[k]

＠Scáthach
To a Celtic warrior, numbers mean nothing.
[k]

＠Scáthach
We're all idiots who fight until we're dead,[sr]or there's no one left to fight!
[k]

？1：...You mean death is attacking us?

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
No, no, that's not it.[sr]That's not it at all.
[k]

？2：I don't understand.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
That's fine. That's how you should be.[sr]You probably haven't grasp the concept of death yet.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Scáthach
"This place" is overflowing[sr]with remnants "abandoned" by death.
[k]


[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
This is a dream I'm sharing with Senpai, right?[sr]So why would it be filled with something like that?
[k]

＠Mash
I don't think the Heroic Spirit I got my power from[sr]had the attribute to interfere with death...
[k]


[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
I'm sure. A Heroic Spirit who brings death wouldn't suit[sr]you at all. This phenomenon is taking place inside you...
[k]

＠Scáthach
...But the causal factor is outside.[sr]It's a touch unfair, but, [charaFace D 4]it can't be helped.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
That's what it means for all of[sr]human history to be incinerated.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
A normal extinction would cause death to overflow.[sr]Purgatory, underworld, anywhere souls can go would be overflowing.
[k]

＠Scáthach
But this is different. Incineration of Humanity is a[sr]"great deed" that doesn't just burn away life, but death itself.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
A great deed...that burns away death?
[k]


[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
Yes. Miracles that humans use are things like[sr]magecraft, rituals, sacraments, and curses.
[k]

＠Scáthach
And then there are the "Authorities" the gods are said to[sr]possess. But the Incineration of Humanity doesn't belong to any of those.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Thus, it is a great deed.[sr]A human "feat" which surpasses even the "gods."
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Scáthach
...Though not even I am certain what that truly is.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
And so what you're seeing here are the remnants[sr]abandoned by death, the direct result after many eras being incinerated.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Then, some of them leaked into this place.
[k]


[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
You don't...[sr]You don't mean inside Chaldea?
[k]


[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
That's correct, in a sense, but also not.[sr]Those remnants exist even closer than you imagined.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Scáthach
Indeed. But not those marshmallows.[sr]It's the warm "heart" that's pulsing inside of you with life.
[k]


[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
!!!
[k]

＠Mash
D-Do you mean...[sr]Those remnants have already been corrupting us!?
[k]

＠Mash
That's... What you mean, right?[sr]That's[charaFace A 12] why I'm suddenly with Senpai in these flames...
[k]

？1：It's okay. I don't think you have to worry.
？2：It'll be fine. Let's go back to Chaldea together.

Hehe. I thought you'd get scared, but you're holding on[sr]to hope. I can't believe how pure you are, but those purest are often the strongest.
[k]

＠Scáthach
[%1]'s optimism and Mash's pessimism. I find both equally worthy.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Scáthach
Even after two thousand years, you humans haven't[sr]changed a bit. So fragile and ephemeral, but noble and beautiful.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
[line 3]It's time to go. Follow me.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
R-Right.[sr]...[charaFace A 6]No, wait. Where are we going?
[k]


[charaFadein D 0.1 0]
[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
To destroy all the remnants that threatens[sr]to overwhelm you.
[k]

＠Scáthach
As my Land of Shadows no longer exists, normally[sr]I wouldn't waste time on ghosts abandoned even by the wheel of reincarnation.
[k]

＠Scáthach
But I do not think I can just let these things overflow.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Scáthach
...I know how frustrating it is to want to die, and not be able to.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
If the gods will not save them, I will.[sr]If they want a fight, I have no reason to refuse.
[k]

？1：So this is the Celtic way!


[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Y-Yes, Senpai...[sr]This violent but dependable power is the Celtic way...
[k]

？2：YEAH!


[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Senpai![sr]Is the Celtic way getting to you?
[k]
