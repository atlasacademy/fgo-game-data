I'm not picking up any more enemies nearby.[sr]Those must've just been some strays.

I suppose that's the quality of enemies you get right at the entrance. We need to find the real deal as soon as possible[line 3]

Um, shouldn't we head toward that totally[sr]suspicious-looking castle over there, Master?

Eh, not really.[sr]It was probably my imagination. Just forget it.

(A nearby tremor in the Singularity... Really. It couldn't[sr]be. Hmmm, I'll just pretend I didn't see anything.)

You kids just go on enjoying yourselves. You'd best[sr]head to the castle first, like the invitation said.
