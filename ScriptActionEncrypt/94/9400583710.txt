＠Mash
It doesn't have any special ornamentation, but it looks the way a lighthouse should. They look very pleased with it.
[k]


？1：For security purposes?
？2：Maybe they have a fetish for lighthouses?

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
No, Senpai.[sr]In my opinion, it was probably a practical request.

＠Anne
That's true. To pirates, lighthouses are invaluable guideposts. We would never take them for granted.
[k]

＠Mary
In fact, there are some pirates who even treated them as sacred. You could say they loved them as they might women.

＠Mary
There's nothing like arriving at your destination after a perilous voyage...seeing the light of a lighthouse...and making disgusting jokes about it.
[k]



？1：What? What jokes?
？！

[charaFace F 3]
＠Mary
Oh, come on.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Anne
You're quite a mean one, aren't you, Master?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Anne
I mean, we're pirates, so we're fine with that sort of thing, but an innocent girl like Mash would feel a tad uncomfortable hearing a joke like this.
[k]

＠Anne
Why don't we hold off on that answer for another time?

＠Mary
In any case, now we can have some peace of mind whenever we want to head out to sea.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Anne
Right. Speaking of which, Master?
[k]

＠Anne
If you decide you want to sail off as a pirate, go ahead and command us anytime.
[k]

＠Anne
Now that this lighthouse can clearly illuminate our way back, we'll happily sail the seas with you whenever you wish♪
