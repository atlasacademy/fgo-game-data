Of course. I need to be sharp.[sr]A dim-witted warrior would be useless.

＠Cú Chulainn
Besides, I love holidays. Not as much as Fergus, but “wine, women, and song,” right?
[k]

？2：You're pretty frank about this!

＠Cú Chulainn
It may look like it has no meaning attached to it, but those earrings have a bit of sentimental value to them.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Well, that's my own story to tell.[sr]You wouldn't know about it.

Either way the celebration's just begun, partner.[sr]Let's head on over to the cafeteria! Yeah!
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Everyone's getting into the holiday spirit.[sr]Let's have a contest to see how many we can grab!
[k]

？1：YEAH!

？2：What if Scáthach is there?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
Hahaha, seriously? Impossible...[sr]No, I guess I can't guarantee that.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.[sr]What will be, will be. Maybe we can both go in there and brace for death?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Don't worry, I'll bury you if you die.[sr]Though, I may be beaten to a pulp, too.

Well, I'll savor this at a later time. I prefer salty things, but I can make an exception just for today.

＠Cú Chulainn
A good Master and a good battlefield. This is enough for me, even without any liquor.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
I'll need to hold back a few more years until you're of drinking age.
