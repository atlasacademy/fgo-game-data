I would like to help out, but I'm in a complicated situation at the moment.

It's a bit difficult to do right away. It is likely related to the fact that I am forced to be a Lancer.

I agree. I think it is necessary to find a place to rest. Luckily, it looks like we can easily obtain wood.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Yup yup, Kiyohime gets it![sr]The smell of wood is really comforting, you know?

[charaFace E 1]
＠Kiyohime
I don't mind how small it is, Master.[sr]They say home is where the heart is.

Rather, we may be forced to keep our bodies close...perhaps our shoulders may accidentally touch...

I just wanted to point out that this is going to be Master's first base.
[k]

＠Altria
Considering this is going to be the new frontier for the pioneering of this island, a house made of wood seems to be a little austere.
[k]

＠Altria
I believe we should first use stones to build sturdy living quarters.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Altria
The stability of a stone-made base is incomparable.[sr]Its defensive powers are also very strong.

Dammit, even if it's a coincidence, our opinions matched! Yep, defense is important!

＠Mordred
Hey...what about iron?[sr]Why don't we use iron to build it?
[k]

＠Mordred
It's strong, and we'll be safe from any enemy.[sr]Good idea, right? (Glance)
