？1：Shoes...?
？！

＠Geronimo
They are called moccasins.[sr]Basically leather shoes.
[k]

＠Geronimo
I personally tanned them using a beast's hide, so it's a handmade item, not mass-produced.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Geronimo
To be honest, they're not very comfortable. Something mass-produced or made by a proper artisan cobbler would be more comfortable.

＠Geronimo
But hear me out, Master: what's important about these shoes is that they can be made by one's own hand.
[k]

＠Geronimo
You may not really know, but walking barefoot is tough. A foot injury may even be fatal.
[k]

＠Geronimo
And humans never carry around two pairs of shoes. So, what would happen if you had no shoes in a wasteland or a forest?
[k]

＠Geronimo
...You could make a pair like this. The ability to make moccasins may be the difference between life and death for you one day.
[k]

＠Geronimo
That's why the mocassins I just gave you are only a sample. Now then, Master, shall I show you how to make moccasins right now?
[k]

？1：Please!
？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Geronimo
Heh heh. You're one eager pupil. Let us begin work while eating the chocolates you gave me.
