If it's a man, let's melt him all the way to the bone. Taunt him, torture him, and then swallow him. Isn't that right, Silver Horn?

[charaFace F 1]
＠Silver Horn
Yes, Golden Horn. However, if it's a woman, let's welcome her warm-heartedly, play with her, befriend her, and then slowly drink her dry... Hehehe.

We've spent many days here already, yet you didn't see that ring of light in the sky, right?

However, a constant supply of magical energy is needed for us Servants to exist. That supply is coming from somewhere right now.
