＠Tamamo-no-Mae
As the summertime celebrity fox, I hereby declare myself quite suited to castle life! It brings out my noble aura!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Yes, it's so fitting that it wouldn't be strange to have a portrait of me hanging on the walls.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Huh? Inari god statues? Hmmm, well if they're put in place as gargoyles, I suppose it would be fine.

True, this castle is small, but it should be enough for this island. I believe it is a good castle, Master.

＠Altria
The only thing that perturbs me is that this place might have Heracles lurking about.

It's such a gorgeous castle, yet Marie and Altria seem right at home.

＠Marie
Any castle would appear small by comparison with Versailles or Schönbrunn. Those were royal palaces, after all.
[k]

＠Marie
But the fact that this castle is small is part of its charm. How can I put it? It's...homey?
[k]

＠Marie
Why, in Versailles, it felt like I was always crossing paths with total strangers.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
My experience is basically just with Japanese palaces, but I've had that experience too.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
The bigger the castle, the more people you need to maintain it.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
It becomes less “a home” than “a place filled with many people.”

True. In a smaller castle on a small stretch of land, the bonds of the people gathered get stronger.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Marie
Wouldn't it be nice if we became like that?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Altria
Indeed, Master. You are the king of this castle, and we are your knights.
[k]

＠Marie
Or rather, you are the king here, and I am your queen...perhaps?

And I, of course, am your ever helpful ideal wife shrine maiden fox!

The kind who stands behind her king with a mysterious smile, but will cast a deadly curse upon enemies when needed.

As one who will share this abode with you, I pray for our unity to be like a family...
[k]

＠Altria
And that we shall all have prosperity as small but certain as this castle.
