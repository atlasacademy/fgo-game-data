Oh, my... The little bird that flew away returns to my loving embrace. Mmm, what a delightful turn of events.

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Like a moth to the flame... Or perhaps you simply couldn't get me out of your head? Hehe...

[charaFace B 8]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
If so, I'll open myself to you all you wish...

＠Sessyoin Kiara
...Over and again until your hearts shatter and your passions wither.

Your unpleasantness has become...grating. Mmm, I will take my sweet time in tending to your destruction.

[charaFace B 8]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
Hmmm... Decisions, decisions...[sr]Your legs are the only part of you that is worthwhile...

Ah, of course! I'll begin by smashing those pathetic hands of yours first. You don't need those anyway, do you?

[charaFace B 4]

...What's this? And here I was thinking we could have so much fun together.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
Why, you ask...?[sr]Well... Heehee.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 10]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
...Because I was envious.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
It was so unfair, you see...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
Could there have been anything more incredible?[sr]The experience of Zepar's memories...
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
The battle at the Temple of Time played out for me like a dream.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
Zepar, Goetia... Everything from that time...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
It all seemed so...delightful. So much so that I found myself desperate to feel the same before long.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
I wanted to FEEL that punishment, that pain. I wanted to experience death at the hands of countless Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
But I could not make that dream a reality simply as a human, or a Demon God.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
So, I was certain that my only choice was to become a Beast.
[k]

？1：...
？2：Of all the reasons...!

I understand your shock, but that's just the kind of person Kiara is.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
That she would become a Beast just for something like that is what makes her so terrifying.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
At first, she had all the qualities you'd look for in a savior. But she forsook them for her own self-indulgence.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Her abundant love, her healing words, her beautiful devotion... She used them all for her own benefit.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Her saintlike appearance had everyone around her fooled. They all misunderstood.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
Isn't that right, Kiara.[sr]You said you loved humans and wanted to save them.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
But...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Meltryllis
But, in your world, the only human...was you.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
That's why you love “humans” more than anyone else.[sr]And you'll expend all other life to save “them.”
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Meltryllis
As far as you're concerned, you're the only human! Everyone else is just a collection of walking, talking toys that exist only for your amusement!

Can you truly call such beasts human? If you could, such nameless heroes would go unrewarded for their efforts.

...Does that answer your question? Good. Enough of this lover's spat. Let's pick up where we left off.

I want to use pleasure as my stepping stones.[sr]More and more... I want to be a receptacle of pleasure.

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Why, you ask? That should be obvious.[sr]I wish to be worshipped as a god.

＠Sessyoin Kiara
I have become the god of pleasure, an all-consuming nirvana. All life will be plucked from the vine and savored like fruit.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
All right, darlings. The day of salvation has come.[sr]Off to the heavens with you.
