＠Teach
Sea and sky. Though our territories differ, I also share my fate with my ship. I understand how Missy X felt so much it hurts.

I'm of the same opinion.[sr]I think X's sword is absolutely amazing!
[k]

＠Lily
It maintains its classic and noble design, but who would've guessed it's a secret weapon with that many functions...
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

I can sense the freedom in its design![sr]It's cosmo-good!

Dammit! Forget about mister gloomy.[sr]Let's talk about my little sister here!
[k]

＠Teach
To be precise, Lily's Noble Phantasm training.
[k]

＠Teach
How about this? By way of apology, how about if I, Blackbeard, train you myself?
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Teach
Well, I totally expect something to happen during training. I may look like this, but I know no shame.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Teach
I will turn my defeat into an opportunity. I will pretend to be your ally and wait for my chance to strike.
[k]

＠Teach
Now, this is top secret. The reason I don't use a pistol is so I can get in close to grapple with my opponent.
[k]

＠Teach
Try using your Noble Phantasm on me once.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Teach
I shall dance as gracefully as a butterfly and dash to catch you like a bee.
[k]

＠Teach
This is the kind of dazzling training experience I can offer you. How about it?
[k]

？1：How about no.
？2：It's obvious what you're after, Captain.
