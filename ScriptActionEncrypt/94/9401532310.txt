＠Professor M
Ishtar's fatal mistake was not competing in the race herself.
[k]

＠Professor M
Granted, it's understandable why she didn't, since the results had nothing to do with her goal...
[k]

＠Professor M
But if she had, she would have given herself a strong alibi.
[k]

“Oh wow! Gugalanna came back to life after I won the race! Since he's here, I might as well make him one of my Authorities, seeing as I won the race and all!”
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Professor M
If she had merely said something like that, the other racers would have been hard-pressed to object.
[k]

＠Professor M
"Winner takes all" is all well and good, but the very notion of “spectator takes all” is absurd on its face.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Professor M
...Which is why I went around taking bets on who would win the race from some of Chaldea's staff and the numerous hedonistically inclined Servants dwelling here.
[k]

＠Professor M
I modestly downplayed our vehicle's specs, and greatly played up the specs for our rivals' machines.
[k]

＠Professor M
Thanks to that, I was able to dramatically increase our winnings. Indeed, the house DOES always win!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Professor M
Of course, the ones placing the bets had no way of knowing that I was the house in this case.
[k]

＠Professor M
Perhaps matters would have been different if I had harmed [%1] in some way, but with a petty crime of this nature, even Holmes or a user of Clairvoyance would have no choice but to let me go.
[k]

＠Professor M
No thief can hope to escape punishment if their reach exceeds their grasp. Unfortunately for the greedy goddess, she failed to understand that.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Professor M
Now then, what to do with all this material and QP I've scraped together...?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Professor M
Under normal circumstances,[sr]I should probably present it to [%1]...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Professor M
But, as with all matters, timing is everything. At the moment, there is no telling what the future beyond this summer of 2019 holds...
[k]

＠Professor M
So I think I shall hold on to them for just a bit longer.[sr][charaFace C 0]After all, one never knows when they may be needed!
