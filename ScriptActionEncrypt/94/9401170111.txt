You have the power to fight.[sr]I don't just mean the skills necessary to fight...

You possess a sword. A sword that dwells within your heart, that is.

...but it's kinda useless once we start runnin' into weird magical anomalies and crap like Bounded Fields, huh?
[k]

＠Mordred
Hunting for Singularity remnants... I figured we could forget about them and they'd disappear on their own.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

Or...has it gotten so bad that it was on its way to becoming a full-blown Singularity?

？2：I didn't ask.

？！

[charaFace C 5]

He left without giving his name? Hah. What a big shot. I can't put my finger on it, but something about him sort of pisses me off.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
U-um... Regardless of whether he's human or a Rogue Servant...
[k]

＠Mash
He had amazing combat power.[sr]He was able to keep up with those giant creatures.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
According to Senpai...he was a hooded man who looked like a knight?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Mordred
Huh? A hooded knight? That means he's not from that Singularity, to say the least.
[k]

？1：He was like a knight, or maybe a swordsman...
？2：He's like a knight in shining armor.

？！

[charaFace C 5]
＠Mordred
What the heck?
[k]

Senpai mentioned that the man's attire reminded [&him:her] of the Knights of the Round Table. Isn't that right, Senpai?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

What? Us? But I don't remember anyone with a hood.
[k]

＠Mordred
I mean, Gareth wore a helmet all the time.[sr]And that jackass Percival didn't have anything either...
[k]

＠Mordred
Or...uh, did he wear a helmet? Like, when he was super serious? ...No, wait... Er, maybe that was Palamedes?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Mordred
...Nope, nope, it was definitely a helmet.
[k]

＠Mordred
So no. None of us wore hoods.
