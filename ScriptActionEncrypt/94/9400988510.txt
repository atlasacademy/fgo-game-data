Arrrgh, I'm so angry I'm ASCENDING![sr]I may get all the way to my third Ascension!

To calm this anger of mine, all lasting love must be eradicated! Like an epidemic, there is no end to this horrible plague!

Come, sweet death! Come, sweet death![sr]Or come, sweets...!

Oh-ho. It is you, Master. What business do you have?[sr]As you can see, I am in the middle of meditating.

At first glance, I may look like I am bored, but my mind is like unto an octopus's tentacle moving about a jar, swirling around!

I would appreciate it if you would leave me alone...

I had thought that my anger had finally twisted even the laws of physics, but here we are...

Excuse me. May I take a bite? Is it allowed? Allowed? Then if you don't mind... (Munch)

This guides your descent into the gentle abyss. In a sleepless night, this shall help you to fall into deep slumber.
