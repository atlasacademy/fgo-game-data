＠Sanzang
Golden Horn and Silver Horn escaped, but they didn't really do anything bad, so let's turn a blind eye for now!

Wise decision. The spoils of war are more important right now. Oh, leave the management of the treasure to me. I'll make sure it's done right.

＠Sanzang
How admirable. You're willing to give up your old ways even though you're a demon! ...But then again, you haven't done anything wrong, have you?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanzang
Let's see, which should I have you do... 10,000 Hindu squats or copying the Heart Sutra 10,000 times...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
You look fit already, so maybe copying the Heart Sutra will be a good punishment.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Bronze Horn
Well then, I will copy the sutra.[sr]Yes, copying sounds good. I'm not good at that.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
Okay! Then I'll write you a recommendation letter to the librarian at Daci'en Temple! Study hard!
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Bronze Horn
Thank you so much.[sr]Personally this is the best thing ever!

Bronze Horn... No, I shouldn't say anything now. It's better than being turned into some kind of demon king.

I was a little worried, but it seems this time around my disciples are hard workers!
