Senpai, Senpai, what is Mordred going to do to us at this quiet, secluded river?
[k]


？1：She's probably going to do us in...
？2：Our corpses will float downriver[csr]and it'll be the perfect crime...

...Anyway. I guess I did leave you in the dark. Here you go, Master. I threw this together yesterday. Go ahead and use it.

What? Was that a joke? It wasn't even funny...[sr]No, dummy, it's a surfboard. A surfboard!

I saw the jealous look you had when I was surfing, so here you are!

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mordred
And I'll teach you how to surf as well.[sr]It's your first time, right?
[k]

＠Mordred
I've taken up river surfing lately.[sr]Just for a change of pace.
[k]

＠Mordred
I thought this would be better for beginners, so I brought you guys along.

＠Mordred
Or did you intend to surf on your shield?[sr]It's probably not impossible, but still...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

Huh. That'd actually be pretty blasphemous. I like it.[sr]You really know how to rock.

If I ever form a suicide surfer squad, I'll let you be my right-hand man.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mordred
Of course, I'll be the leader.[sr]And, naturally, we'll be attacking King Arthur.
[k]

＠Mordred
I can already imagine... The king's forces in perfect formation...with our suicide surfers suddenly emerging from the sea behind them... Hah! We'll win for sure.

Going against the flow of a giant wave, not with it... Pretty treacherous, eh? The other definition.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

It matches my character, right? I always have to go against something. If there's no treachery, I can't go on...

For a knight, whether it be horse, wave, or woman... The harder they are to handle, the greater the valor in taming them!

Poison swamp? Bring it on! It's only deadly if I fall in. Did you think I'd be frightened by a wave that size!?
