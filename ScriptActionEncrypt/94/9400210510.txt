＠Mephisto
Hellooo, I'm coming in![sr]Oohhh! Now this is good! I like 'em charred!
[k]

＠Mephisto
And it's smelly in here! The smell of my kind! The kind that committed a crime, and thus was labeled as a monster...
[k]

＠Mephisto
...then ridiculed and feared by all! The kind that couldn't escape their punishment even after death!

Good, you're so considerate![sr]Let's see... I'm in the mood now!
[k]

＠Elisabeth
What was today's party supposed to be?[sr]Oh well, doesn't matter! It's a feast!
[k]

＠Elisabeth
I can take off your hands and feet while you're still alive, like shrimps, okay? Burn your organs from the inside like pigs?
[k]

＠Elisabeth
Yes! Then I'll kill you![sr]Let's kill, let's do it, humans!
