Then will you try and take it back with their help? Because I can assure you, we are prepared for anything you might attempt.

＠Mecha Eli-chan
If you truly long for your castle, now is the time to show the strength of your conviction.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Oh, by the way, I should let you know that I had all the gates welded shut, since I can just fly.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
So again, if you truly want to take Himeji Castle back...you and the Master of Chaldea's entourage will need to scale the walls.

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Well, farewell, everyone. I hope you have a wonderful day, complete with lots of fulfilling labor.

Granted, it did take everything I had just to glide out of the castle while carrying Batty, but I can still totally ascend on my own strength!

Boy, Batty, you haven't got much in the way of stamina, huh? You won't last a second in a Holy Grail War like that.
[k]

＠Osakabehime
...So what? I don't care about Holy Grail Wars.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
You don't?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

＠Osakabehime
Nope. All I want is to relax and take it easy all day.
[k]

＠Osakabehime
I get all the excitement I need twice a year from the summer and winter matsuri.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
Is that so? You Japanese princesses sure have a lot of time on your hands, huh. That sucks.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Elisabeth
Of course, as ruler of the castle and idol, the idea of having that much time to lounge around does have its appeal! Too bad I'm so busy each and every day!
[k]

＠Osakabehime
FORMER ruler of the castle. And I bet you're still just an underground idol at best.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Elisabeth
Hey, nothing “former” about me! Mecha Eli-chan hasn't beat me yet, after all! And every idol's career has to start somewhere!
[k]

？1：Are they fighting because they're so close?
？2：Listen to that fight. They must be such good friends.

？！

[charaFace D 3]

＠Osakabehime
I-I wouldn't really say that.[sr]We are both of very different social standings, after all...
[k]

＠Osakabehime
We've just made a temporary alliance because our goals are similar is all.

Really? 'Cause I kind of admire that crafty, scheming side of yours.

If that robot...dragon...girl...thing was telling the truth, the first thing we've gotta do is scale Castle Csejte from the outside.

The only problem with that is...well...[sr]See for yourselves.
