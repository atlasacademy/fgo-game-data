Phew, playing with beach balls is fun, but I'm a bit tired. How about we take a break? Don't worry, it looks like we have nothing but time.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I can't believe how elegant I was in securing that victory! I'm... I'm scared of myself! My own elegance is terrifying!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
BUT! Being the beautiful, successful woman I am,[sr]I mustn't gloat! I must be graceful with my gifts!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
And so instead off I go to relax in the shade of my parasol, brushing my tail and flaunting my sexy body for the whole world to see!

Girls, it's up to you to decide how tropical you want to feel on this island.
[k]

＠Altria
However, just know that your actions directly affect both our Master's present AND future.
[k]

＠Altria
Do not forget that. Make sure you pull yourselves together when you're supposed to.
[k]

＠Altria
By the way, Master, I have an important question.[sr]What is for dinner tonight?

[charaFace E 3]
＠Scáthach
...Hmm? What is with this feeling of excitement?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

Perhaps it's the sea, the beach, and the shining sun.[sr]This is rare indeed...

It appears that everyone is starting to get used to life on this island.

At first, everything was inconvenient and everyone was feeling dissatisfied, but maybe now all the hard work has finally paid off.

However... something strange has been happening. Would you listen to me, Master?
[k]

？1：Of course.
？2：Please grace us with your wise words!

[charaFace G 5]
＠Martha
I-I'd rather you not be that formal with me all the time.
[k]

＠Martha
If you ain't joking, then I'll really make you my lackey![sr][charaFace G 3]...Um, ahem, where was I?

Count me in. If they dare go against the teachings of God, I will punish them... despite the fact that they're also castaways.
[k]

＠Martha
That's right, this is not about us being nosy. We're simply taking a peek into what they're doing. It's a holy and sacred act of confirmation!
