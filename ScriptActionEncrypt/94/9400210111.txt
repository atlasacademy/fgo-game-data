Battle was interrupted, but...we still don't know that Servant's real name, nor its attack pattern!
[k]

＠Mash
Doctor, please give us your analysis!
[k]

＠Mash
How can a simple knife cut not only a Servant's body, but easily cut its armor too?!

＠Dr. Roman
In the world of Magecraft, magical eyes that can perceive all things mystical are called Mystic Eyes.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
These eyes can project phenomena without casting any sorts of chants or rituals. They just need to look.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The most popular types are “Binding,” “Compulsion,” “Contract,” “Flame,” “Illusion,” and “Jinx.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even among them, her eyes are special. The type that can “Stop” everything, it's even more powerful than “Petrification.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Her rainbow eyes materialize the concept of death and capture it. If I had to give them a name, I'd call them the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Dr. Roman
How incredible! That's an ability fit for a Divine Spirit! To kill an enemy just by looking at them... Talk about overpowered!

[k]

＠D：???
I'm not a Heroic Spirit.[sr]I can't kill anyone just by looking at them.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠D：???
All I can do is see death... Lines that trace death. Ummm, like the eventual end of all things.
[k]

＠D：???
Would you understand if I say I simply trace the cause, the result of eventual death?

Of course! Who else could it be? Physically, you're not a complete Servant, right?

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
R-Right. I'm a Demi-Servant,[sr]so you could say that my base body is human...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠D：???
I see. I thought you were that shadowy bastard's friend.
[k]

＠D：???
That [&man:woman]'s eyes are glittering. I guess that rules out the possibility of being possessed by some weird illusions.
[k]

＠D：???
My bad for attacking you. All right, see ya.

[FFFFFF]I am going to tear down this apartment.[-] I can't just leave it like that.
[k]

＠D：???
It's crawling with disgusting things inside. If I let it be, it's gonna cause trouble for the neighbors.
[k]

＠D：???
Say, do you guys watch horror movies?[sr]You do? Good.
[k]

＠D：???
You know the deal... Things like walking corpses, ghosts you aren't supposed to see...
[k]

＠D：???
Things like that are running rampant in there... All because of Servants.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
All because of...Servants?
[k]

[charaFace D 8]
＠D：???
Yeah. Servants live in that apartment like it's their own. Thanks to them, it's all becoming one big block party.
[k]

＠D：???
I mean, Servants are kinda like ghosts, right? If they gain physical bodies, others will get carried away too.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠D：???
...Well, as for myself, I am also showing up as a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠D：???
If you're a Demi-Servant, I guess that makes me a Pseudo-Servant.
[k]

＠D：???
Most likely I had a connection with this building, so I ended up being summoned. It's really annoying.
[k]

？1：If you're a Servant, you need a Master...
？2：Will you be okay by yourself?

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠D：???
Who cares? If I vanish, it actually saves me some trouble. At least I don't have to go through this ordeal.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
I don't know if you're being frank, or you just don't care about yourself...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mash
Still, though...[sr]There must be a reason why we met here!
[k]

＠Mash
If you don't have a Master, could you work with Chaldea?
[k]

＠D：???
...A reason, you say.[sr]This, too, must be my fate... I don't hate it.
[k]

＠D：???
That one over there is a Master, right? If I help you, that would really make me look like a Servant.
[k]

＠D：???
I'm merely an outsider who was summoned here. I don't intend on concerning myself with others.
[k]

＠D：???
However, I want to pay back that despicable shadowy bastard...

Right, this is Master [%1].[sr]My name is Mash Kyrielight.

＠Mash
If we're exchanging our names like this... Does that mean you'll help us, Shiki?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Ryougi Shiki
...Well, if you think about it, the fact that you're a Master probably means you're related to the Servants living here somehow, right?
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
In that case, you're supposed to be the ones to get rid of them. Good luck. I'll be giving you a hand too, so don't worry.
[k]

？1：Thank you, Ryougi-chan!

[charaFace D 2]
＠Ryougi Shiki
You can just call me Ryougi. Aren't you embarrassed, using “chan?”
[k]

？2：...Do you like cats?

[charaFace D 5]
＠Ryougi Shiki
No, I don't.[sr]Also, I wouldn't call that thing a cat.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
It has good fur and feels really nice, that's all. It doesn't even look like one. That's insulting to cats.

Erm... Should I call you Miss Ryougi? You seem to know all about that apartment?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
What was it like inside? Did it turn into a different dimension? It won't kill them upon entering, right?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As you can see, [%1] is just a human. If the air composition is abnormal then...

Here used to be the grave marker of an old mage who attempted to collect death. A hollow shrine that fused the yin-yang and hell together.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
People say “investigations start from the bottom,” right?[sr]Enjoy the case, [%1].

[charaFace D 6]

So once again, rookie Master... Welcome to this 64-story shrine, Ogawa Heim.
