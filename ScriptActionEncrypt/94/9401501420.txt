I could have conceivably given you a few points if you were at least wearing a bikini.

It's not seeing the nip itself, but the IDEA that we might get a little nip-slip that's so tantalizing.

＠Mister B
That dream...that hope for an uncertain future is what I wish to award beauty points to!
[k]

＠Mister B
And yet, I could also end up easily giving full points for a nip slip where the slipper is profoundly embarrassed about it. Truly, the adult world doesn't play fair.
[k]

＠Mister B
Incidentally, there is another reason why I might give points for a bikini.
[k]

＠Mister B
Namely, that I can now create polka dots in my mind's eye thanks to intensive training. Yes, I know how god-tier that sounds.
