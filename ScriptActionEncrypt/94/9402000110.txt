＠Da Vinci
So! Here's what we know about this latest incident.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Recently, a mysterious horned duo were seen using a combination of liquor and crocodile tears to scam the staff into secretly Rayshifting them somewhere.
[k]

？1：“Mysterious”? Really?
？2：Took me all of two seconds to figure who did it.
？！

＠Da Vinci
Sure, we don't exactly need Holmes's help to figure out the culprits this time, but that's not the real issue.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The REAL issue is the strange signal we've been picking up from the little Japanese village they Rayshifted to.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
After a bit of research, we've figured out[sr]that it's yet another minute Singularity.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Da Vinci
I'm guessing they Rayshifted there after they caught wind of some treasure to be found.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Couple of slick operators, those two[line 2]especially that Shuten-Douji. I could easily see them digging up, say, a Holy Grail.
[k]

？1：You shouldn't go around digging up Holy Grails willy-nilly.

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Mash
Indeed. There's a lot of variation to be found even among Holy Grails...
[k]

＠Mash
It is possible one could end up with a grail due to the space-time distortion created by the incineration and restoration of humanity.

That said, it doesn't look like[sr]this is a full-blown Holy Grail.
[k]

？！

＠Da Vinci
We did get a reading that looked like a Holy Grail for just a moment, but it turned out to be more like a pile of Holy Grail fragments.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Still, it's a fairly big pile, with a lot of pure magical energy to it. I imagine that's what Shuten-Douji and Ibaraki-Douji are looking to get their hands on.

Can you tell us what exactly's going on in that area, Acting Commander Da Vinci?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

If Shuten and Ibaraki are involved, does that mean there's an alcoholic fog hanging over the place, like there was during Rashomon?

Well our readings sure resemble the Rashomon mess,[sr]but things are a little different this time.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Da Vinci
Here, we're dealing with a tower.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's odd. The thing appeared out of nowhere and we're not sure what it's for.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Da Vinci
It's not just any old tower. The height and shape of the thing shouldn't be possible from a structural standpoint.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You'll know what I mean when you see it for yourselves.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Da Vinci
At any rate, I have no idea what they're planning, but we can't risk this turning into another Singularity.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[%1], I need you to Rayshift there yourself and handle this before that happens.
[k]

？1：You got it.
？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠Da Vinci
That's what I like to hear.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Of course, you won't be going alone.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Given this particular location, I thought it'd be best if a Japanese Servant well-acquainted with its climate and culture went along with you.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Fortunately, I already found one killing time in the rec room. Come on in!

I was quite busy sneaking up on cowardly snipers and knifing them in their backs...

I speak, of course, of the games where two players take turns commanding pieces on a wooden battlefield.

Shogi, chess, backgammon, Spehss Mehreens 41,000...

＠Da Vinci
A peaceful resolution would be pretty much out of the question with her in charge.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So I thought that since you're not a Berser[line 2]I mean, since you have a good head on your shoulders, you'd be a good choice to lead this mission.

＠Female Samurai
However... If it is not too forward of me, there is one thing I would like to ask of you, Master.
[k]

？1：What is it?
？！

[charaFace C 5]

＠Female Samurai
This will be my first mission since I was summoned to Chaldea. As such, I cannot afford to fail.
[k]

＠Female Samurai
Even as we speak, I have been steeling myself with even greater resolve than usual.
[k]

＠Female Samurai
Therefore, if you do not mind...I would ask to be given an official title for this operation. A “call sign,” I believe, is the term.

After all, a special name gives one a special sense of purpose.
