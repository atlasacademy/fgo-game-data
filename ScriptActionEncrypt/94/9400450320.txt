＠Dr. Roman
All right, I've sent Kotarou and Kintoki out on a recon and scouting mission.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As for us, we should go to check on the safety of the area.

Yes. First of all, let's take a peek over that cliff and get a look around.

＠Ushiwakamaru
Good idea. If the view is good, we might be able to see something.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I, Ushiwaka, have great confidence in my vision.[sr]That's because I was raised on Mt. Kurama!

＠Dr. Roman
How is it? Can you see anything?
[k]


[charaTalk D]


＠Ushiwakamaru
...Yes. I can see oni... and humans as well, gathering in an open space.
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Humans? I see, so there are some on the island.[sr]What is the situation like?
[k]







＠Mash
A forced labor camp... It looks like oni are supervising the humans and making them work.
[k]


＠Ushiwakamaru
Yes. They're wielding whips and shouting[line 2] It looks like there are some oni that understand human language.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
The humans there are digging holes in the ground, and carrying dirt and logs...
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Hmm. That really does sound like a forced labor camp.[sr]I wonder why the oni are making humans do that?
[k]


＠Mash
I don't know. All I know is there are a lot of oni gathered there.
[k]

＠Mash
Even if we want to free the people working there, we'll just end up in the same mess as before.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
...That's right. And there's more than just that one place where oni are forcing humans to work.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
To try and free everyone from all those camps...[sr]I wouldn't say that's a realistic idea.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
It would be best to keep making our way inland, and do something about the mastermind... I think.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
The information I have is just as I said.[sr]I found several work locations, and...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
A way to get to the middle of this island[line 3]to the highest point.
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Oh, so you've found a route there?
[k]

[charaTalk E]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Simply put, there is an easy path.[sr]It is not difficult to traverse. But[line 2]
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
...But what?
[k]

[charaTalk E]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
To get to the top, we have to go through three gates that the oni have constructed along the way. There is no way around them.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
And...they seem to be closed at all times.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
To open those gates, you need the keys from three great oni who appear to be the gate keepers.

Three great oni guarding the three gates... I see.
[k]

[charaTalk E]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
They also appear to be the ones commanding the lesser oni...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
They are far more powerful than the lesser oni, with strength I've never seen before.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
And what's more, I think...the oni have hired a terrifying guard.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Unfortunately, that's when it got away from me...

The oni that I extracted this information from.[sr]I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at interrogation.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
However, that oni didn't seem to be lying, so I believe it was a good trade-off...
[k]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 1]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Hahaa! You didn't have the desire to go after it and kill it, huh? You are very kind, Kotarou.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
If it had been me, I'd have gone right after it, and made it regret its cowardice.
[k]

[charaTalk E]
[charaFace E 4]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
No, that would have been a waste of time...
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
...Ushiwakamaru, who grins while speaking of violence, and Kotarou, always calm and unnervingly rational...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Japan's Heroic Spirits are, how to put this... They look approachable enough, but are actually terrifying...
[k]

？1：I know what you mean.
？2：Kotarou is a ninja after all.

Attack! We'll cut our way through them, Master!
