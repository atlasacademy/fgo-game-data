＠Both
We swear we're innocent!
[k]

？1：Caesar, is that true?

[charaTalk on]
[charaFace D 1]
＠Caesar
It's true!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Caesar
Selling those counterfeits for cheap wouldn't bring in any money anyway.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Caesar
First I'd tell the customer that I'm offering the real Mona Lisas! Then I'd buy up all of the Craft Essences from Da Vinci.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Caesar
Why? Because as long as I've got the real ones with me, the customers would be willing to pay full price...
[k]

＠Caesar
without having to worry about them being fakes![sr]To just distribute the counterfeits for free like that[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Caesar
I swear to you on my very soul.[sr]I would never do something so wasteful!

＠Mash
This Caesar is also the real thing!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Indeed. He knows that trust is the strongest foundation for a business.
[k]


？2：P, are you trying to do what you think's best, again?

[charaTalk on]
[charaFace E 4]
＠Paracelsus
Even if I did make Mona Lisa counterfeits... I don't think that would have any good effect on the world.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Paracelsus
The Mona Lisa is the pinnacle of art.[sr]Not many paintings share that same level of fame.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Paracelsus
Degrading it to the level of counterfeits is unthinkable even in the world of magecraft.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Paracelsus
...However, if something can be created by sacrificing the original, I guess that would be all right...

It wouldn't be all right![sr]My heart would sustain heavy damage!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
But... I guess the two of them aren't behind the counterfeits.

I'm sorry...we got ahead of ourselves.

＠Caesar
Humph. Don't be sad, oh girl who is plump and firm in a different way than me.
[k]

＠Caesar
After all, we secretly Rayshifted here because we heard about the rumors of the counterfeits.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Caesar
I thought I could use Paracelsus as a decoy and brought him here... Hahaha, [charaFace D 1]I didn't expect to get caught before we split up.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Paracelsus
It's embarrassing, but I thought the same thing.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Paracelsus
I was going to stand behind Caesar and use Sword P to get rid of both him and the counterfeiter.

I think that mage over there needs to reconsider what “embarrassing” means... Anyway...
[k]

＠Emiya
For now, we're the ones asking questions. I would have you tell us everything you know about the counterfeits.

We're sure there's a group of counterfeiters in this town. My “money sensor” tells me so.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Caesar
But there's one problem. I'm told a Servant is running the counterfeiter's workshop.

A-A Servant![sr]...I see. That explains it.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Da Vinci
But who could it be? Michelangelo? Raphael?[sr]Or perhaps... Donatello?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
There's so many...[sr]Him?[charaFace B 2] Her? Who?
