＠Irisviel
I am the terminal of the Holy Grail, Irisviel von Einzbern.
[k]

＠Irisviel
The Holy Grail has provided me with a blessing.
[k]

＠Irisviel
It is something beyond human intellect.[sr]Some may call it a miracle.

＠Irisviel
Master. Hee hee... What do you think this blessing is?
[k]

？1：I don't know...

[charaFace A 0]

＠Irisviel
Then I shall tell you.
[k]

？2：It's not about magical energy or a Noble Phantasm, is it?

[charaFace A 0]

＠Irisviel
No, it is nothing like that.
[k]

？！

＠Irisviel
Is it the Spirit Origin needed to come into this world? No. Is it one's magecraft abilities worthy to be a Caster? No.
[k]

＠Irisviel
The blessing I received...something wonderful like a miracle. That is...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Irisviel
Cooking instructors!
[k]

？1：I see!
？2：The Heroic Spirits who work in Chaldea's kitchen!

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Irisviel
Yes. That's right.[sr]Miss Boudica and Miss Cat. And...
[k]

＠Irisviel
Miss Shiki and Miss Raikou.[sr]And there's also Archer Emiya.
[k]

＠Irisviel
They all taught me so patiently, and so well!
[k]

＠Irisviel
I struggled at first, but now I can manage to make sweets.
[k]

＠Irisviel
This must all be thanks to being the terminal of the Holy Grail. A pure Heroic Spirit is unlikely to mature and learn this much...
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Irisviel
Or perhaps I am actually very skillful and I had a knack for cooking!
[k]

？1：Maybe.
？2：I don't...know about that...

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Irisviel
Hehe. Either way, I have been blessed.[sr]So that's why...Master?
[k]

＠Irisviel
Please have this.[sr]It's a Valentine's gift from me to you!
[k]

I made it with chocolate and a Japanese style in mind. It's a whole cake, so please enjoy it with Mash.
[k]

＠Irisviel
I shall be going now. I need to go find Illya.[sr]And also search for him...
[k]
