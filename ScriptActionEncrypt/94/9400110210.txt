I already know your names,[sr][%1], Mash. However...

＠Scáthach
...That doesn't mean I know everything about you.[sr]Nor the reason this city is on flames.

What happened here?[sr]This is a place where you once walked, yes?

＠Mash
Yes. Fuyuki City, in the far east. That first place we[sr]shifted to where a Holy Grail War was taking place.
[k]

＠Mash
The year was AD 2004. 13 years ago. It's very close[sr]to the present, but it's still part of the past.
[k]

＠Mash
This is where we...
[k]

？1：Got caught up in a Holy Grail War that shouldn't exist.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Yes, Senpai. We fought many Heroic Spirit[sr]for the fragment of the Grail.
[k]


？2：Got saved by that Caster guy.

[charaFace A 8]

...That's right, Senpai.[sr]Without him, we would've died.

Mash, [%1].[sr]I'm sorry, can I ask a question?

＠Scáthach
Was he doing well "at this place?"

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Oh... Yes![sr]He was doing very well. [charaFace A 6]That's right! You're...
[k]

＠Mash
Scáthach, a warrior, a mentor to many heroes.[sr]You're the woman who trained Cú Chulainn!
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
I-I'm sorry. I knew that in my head, but it's so hard[sr]for me to remember that the Caster who saved us...

＠Mash
...is the same Cú Chulainn who's part[sr]of the Ulster Cycle, and s-so...

I don't know what to say... Um...[sr]Y-Your student really helped us out.

We're alive today thanks to the spell he[sr]wielded when he materialized as a Druid.

I see.[sr]No, there's no need to thank me.

[charaFace D 4]

But nonetheless, as someone deeply related to him,[sr]I shall remember that. And someday, I will tell him.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
If I ever get the chance, that is.[sr]For now, [charaFace D 0]you must first survive this place.

[charaFace D 0]

Otherwise, I'll have to tell him[sr]that I saw the children he saved...
