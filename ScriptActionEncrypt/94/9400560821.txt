Now it actually feels nostalgic.[sr]Who knew I'd be this emotional...

[charaFace H 0]

Yes, it's amazing.

The Japanese card game? Hm, for some reason I remember playing it. Yeah, that'll help us kill some time.

As long as we just relax and enjoy ourselves on this ship, like we did on the island, then we may not have a problem.

＠Mash
Senpai, is there anything you want to do out in the open waters?
[k]


？1：Fish, I guess.

[charaFace B 13]
＠Mash
Well, we did a lot of fishing back on the island... But you're right. Saltwater fishing would be a different experience entirely.

＠Mash
I wonder what kind of fish we'll catch...
