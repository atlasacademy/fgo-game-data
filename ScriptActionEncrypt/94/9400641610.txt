Yes. For many years these ruins have been called the Land of Dead Bookshelves.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Helena
I'll tell you why.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Helena
The ghosts outside, as well as all the books in this room, they were once magical girls.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Helena
This is the graveyard of those poor girls who were plunged into this world. They're called “Echoes.”

Wasn't that place dangerous?[sr]But don't worry, everyone here is peaceful.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Helena
They just sleep here, in the form of grimoires.[sr]Many magical girls liked to read.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Helena
The Echoes who attacked you outside wanted someone to join them...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Helena
Or perhaps they wanted to match spells with a rival, as they once did.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Helena
The reason the Echoes don't attack me is because my role here is to serve guests.
[k]

＠Helena
And I have the jewel that's a symbol of my role.[sr]That's all.
[k]


？1：Are you the owner of the Reality Marble?
？！

[charaFace D 5]
＠Helena
Me? No, that's not me. I don't own the Reality Marble.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Helena
Then you're already aware that this world is inside a vast Reality Marble.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Helena
This world was created by a single magical girl.[sr]She's called the First Lady.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Helena
That's what the Echoes whisper to me.[sr]I've never met her myself.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Helena
It's said that the First Lady is in a sealed space at the center of this world, beyond the black wall.
[k]

No magic can destroy that black wall, and there's no way to know what's inside.

Of course I do. Part of it is my knowledge of theosophy, but...
[k]

＠Helena
We magical girls were originally invited here from many different parallel worlds.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Helena
We were girls who, for various reasons, couldn't be magical girls in our own worlds anymore.
[k]

＠Helena
We had no choice but to come here. We had nowhere else to go. Here, we could continue being magical girls.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Helena
This is, in a sense, our paradise.[sr]And it's the final stop on our journey.

[charaFace D 4]

The Throne of Heroic Spirits that's said to be a hall of records within the void? Unfortunately, [charaFace D 5]it's nothing so noble and innocent as that.

I'll tell you the most important thing.[sr]It's about your friend, Miyu Edelfelt.

＠Helena
This is a guess, but I don't think it was Medb who kidnapped her. It was the First Lady.
[k]

＠Helena
I've always assumed that she was silently monitoring this world from beyond the black wall...

＠Helena
... by transforming her familiars to blend in with those of the other magical girls.

The jewels are crystallized emotions that grant wishes. They should be able to cross the wall, and even reach the outside world.

But that may be part of what the First Lady wants, too. Even so, there's only one way to find out: get all the jewels.
