＠Martha
Wheat fields... They bring back memories.

？1：She's staring off into the distance...
？2：She's so picturesque even without her staff...

＠Mash
Wheat is a very old crop. It's been harvested for over 10,000 years.
[k]

＠Mash
As she has been around the beginning of the Common Era, we see her as someone from the distant past.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yet even for her, wheat was a natural part of the world.

＠Mash
And when you look at it from a different perspective, it still exists in our world today.
[k]

＠Mash
The way history and time form a continuous chain feels strange to me.

＠Martha
My, what a serious conversation.[sr]Ah, and speaking of serious...
[k]

＠Martha
If I had to hold a sermon over a wheat field, the topic should naturally be wheat. Shall I tell you about the Parable of the Tares? Or maybe the Parable of the Grain of Wheat?
[k]


？1：Wh-Why is she preaching all of a sudden?
？！


[charaFace G 5]
＠Martha
Lately I feel so weird without my staff!
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Martha
If I don't tap into that side of myself, I feel I may not be able to revert back once summer is over.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Martha
So it's time for a sermon. A very important one.
[k]

？1：I-I've gotta go...
？！

[charaFace G 5]
＠Martha
Huh!? I said it was very important![sr]Don't talk back to me, minion!
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠Martha
Now kneel! Right there!
