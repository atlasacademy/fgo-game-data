Right. I can feel her aura bearing down on me. Like an avalanche. Like sugar spilling out of a freshly opened package. Or maybe more like spilt azuki beans.

Suzuka Gozen. The heavenly maiden from the Suzuka Mountains who set off to defeat oni alongside her husband, Tamuramaro Sakanoue, during Japan's Heian period.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I knew her beauty and strength led to her being depicted as inhuman, but I never would've guessed she was actually a beast.

She isn't, Edgemiya. Her ears may be stick-on, but they're still real. Think of them like a pair of fluffy spoilers, only super close to real.
[k]

[charaTalk C]
[charaFace C 6]
＠Emiya Alter
So, those ears of hers were actually fake.[sr]Does that mean your ears and paws are fake too then?
[k]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 2]
＠Tamamo Cat
Of course not, you idiot![sr]They're real, and they're spectacular!
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
It may be hard to believe, but Fox is still the daughter of a heavenly emperor. She's got pedigree out the wazoo, and can grow new ears like it's nothing!

＠Passionlip
Plus she was part of a tragic love story...
[k]


＠Passionlip
She managed to defeat Sakanoue's archenemy, Ootakemaru, but only by agreeing to marry him.
[k]


＠Passionlip
Sakanoue was driven to despair without ever learning the truth, and ended up killing Suzuka after allying himself with the oni.

The legends depicted her as having a great intellect, but for some reason, the one we've seen is obsessed with 21st-century Japan.
[k]

？1：Namely the high school girl lingo.
？2：Yeah she's...nuts about the high school girl thing.

？！

＠Meltryllis
Right. I don't understand why she talks like that, but it doesn't make her any less powerful.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
BB even made her a Sentinel because of how much she enjoyed the Holy Grail War battles.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Of course, that was also after she scrapped me.

So, do we assume Suzuka's on BB's side then?[sr]Or the Demon God Pillar's?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Neither, I'm afraid.[sr]I don't think she cares about either of them.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
That's another thing about her I don't understand. Maybe she really does only care about fighting.
[k]

？1：Doesn't she want to use the Grail as a power-up?

＠Meltryllis
I'm sure that's just an afterthought. She doesn't really have any wish for the Grail, so the best she could do was make up something that sounded good.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
So for her, the war is its own reward, huh. If she's just a combat junkie, she shouldn't be too much trouble.

It's not just her. In fact, we haven't seen a single Master since we got here, now I think about it...
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I still don't know how BB, or rather, SE.RA.PH summoned so many Servants in the first place.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
It's probably safe to assume they're strays, and have no Master contracts. Rogue Servants, in other words.

Enjoy your little SE.RA.PH field trip?[sr]Get crazy in awesome battles with other Servants?

＠Suzuka Gozen
I just, like, forgot to mention it, y'know?[sr]It's not a secret or anything.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
I literally have no clue what my Master looked like.[sr]I never saw them. They never gave me an order.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Suzuka Gozen
But...no big, right!? I materialized just fine without knowing anything about them!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
The whole point of this whole Servant-summoning thing is nonstop winning, right? So I am like, super-awesome!
[k]

[charaFace E 12]
＠Suzuka Gozen
The only Servants left are me, you guys, and that Archer with the long hair that got away!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
And since the Servants from Chaldea apparently don't count and stuff, that really just leaves me and the Archer!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
So once one of us is dead, it's curtains on this whole Grail War, and someone's getting her wish granted!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
So TBH, I have zero shits to give about you guys. I'm just gonna wreck you real quick so I can go kill that Archer!
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 2]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Now let's do this thing already![sr]Four on one? Hell yeah! Bring it on!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Don't worry about being all like, fair and stuff. I've got my Karmaphage, remember? Real talk: four of you's probably not gonna be enough!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
If you guys really think you can take me[line 2]Suzuka Gozen, daughter of the Fourth Great Demon King, and badass teenaged Saber[line 2]then hit me with your best shot!
