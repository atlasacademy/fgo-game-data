Perfect. I've changed the power system from DC to AC. And...this must be the factory operation manual.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
A great genius like me does not leave the details untended. Hah! I will switch their operation manuals out with the ones I prepared.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
The diagrams all have images of AC circuits hidden within, undetectable by the conscious mind...
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
On each page, the letters “A” and “C” are always bolded...
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
Anyone reading the manual will be subtly guided to the conclusion that the factory should be run on AC!
