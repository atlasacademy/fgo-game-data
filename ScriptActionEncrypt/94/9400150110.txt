It's such nice weather, isn't it, Senpai?[sr]Oh, would you like some more tea?

＠Mash
Today I've prepared a special apple tea.[sr]Have some more. It'll help you relax.
[k]

＠Mash
Doctor ate too many rice cakes, so he's feeling ill.[sr]He wants you to at least enjoy yourself in his stead.

Yes. This is all thanks to Senpai's kind consent to help Lily get stronger.

gets posted on the bulletin board in Chaldea's cafeteria. But don't worry, if that happens, leave the management to me!

I'll manage your schedule with an iron fist to make sure you become the most loved person within the Heroic Spirit community!

＠Mash
What a surprise.[sr]You're training all by yourself, Lily?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Lily
Yes. I am still an immature Saber, so I want to hone my sword skills whenever I have time.
[k]

＠Lily
But...no matter how hard I train, my Holy Sword is not getting any stronger.
[k]

＠Lily
Though I'm improving little by little, my Noble Phantasm, the pride of a Servant, is still immature...
[k]

＠Lily
And so I've decided to take my leave at this time.
[k]

＠Lily
I have no future as a Servant, so I am afraid I will only be a burden to you, Master...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Oh, Lily...
[k]

？1：Whether strong or weak, you must...
？2：True, your Noble Phantasm must get stronger.

＠Mash
[line 3]Stop.[sr]This is important, so staple that mouth shut, Senpai.
[k]

＠Mash
I am an immature Demi-Servant, so I know painfully well how Lily feels.
[k]

＠Mash
In particular, the level of one's Noble Phantasm is a serious issue. Right now, Lily and I have formed an Unenhanced NP Alliance.
[k]

＠Mash
So I want you to be particularly careful about saying anything about Noble Phantasms.
[k]

？1：...Got it.
？2：Uhm, should you be in an alliance like that?

？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
That's why[line 2] The only thing left for us to do is to train.[sr]Training will never betray anyone!
[k]

＠Mash
You are a magnificent Saber.[sr]Given the opportunity, you'll succeed for sure!
[k]

＠Mash
Don't worry, ok? Isn't that right, Master!
[k]

？1：She will become an A rank for sure.

[charaFace B 3]
＠Lily
I-I'm not so sure about that...[sr]I think you're exaggerating when you say A rank.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Lily
But I appreciate the compliment.[sr]It builds my confidence to hear you say that, Master.
[k]

？2：Whether a strong Heroic Spirit or weak Heroic Spirit, you must...

It's all due to my lack of confidence and my inexperience...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
[line 3]All right. It's been decided.[sr]This next Rayshift will be for Lily's training.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
We must strike while the iron is hot! Before Doctor recovers from his stomachache. We're going to Rayshift on our own!

I'm sure...that it must be my lack of confidence that clouds the glow of this holy sword.

＠Lily
I am a phantom consisting of elements separated from a certain Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Lily
I am the “if” that existed between the time I drew the Sword of Selection and the moment I became King.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Lily
Yes. Indeed “she” also has a form that's in training.[sr]But that form is not as flowery as me.
[k]

＠Lily
I am nothing more than an “if” that is dissimilar to the authentic me.
[k]

＠Lily
But as long as this Lily exists, I am not a fake or a[sr]fraud[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Lily
It's just I cannot help but think that I am not who I originally was and that I am just a mere phantom.
[k]

＠Lily
Now I am unable to train without casting aside my doubt, and I can't unleash my holy sword's potential either...
[k]

＠Lily
More specifically, I can't increase my Noble Phantasm level... That's what my doubts have led to.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

Oh, Lily...
