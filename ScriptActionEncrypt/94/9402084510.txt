？1：What's that floating thing over there...wah!

[charaFace A 12]

＠Ishtar
K[messageShake 0.04 4 4 0]yaaah!!!???[messageShakeStop][sr]Oh. It's just you,[charaFace A 11] [%1]!
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Ishtar
Don't sneak up on me like that.[sr]What? Did some weird sensation draw you here, too?
[k]

？2：A wild EVIL GODDESS, ISHTAR, has appeared!

[charaFace A 2]

＠Ishtar
Who are you calling evil!? I've already reflected on what I did during the race, so now I'm off the hook!
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Ishtar
And besides, Chaldea's gotten scary lately. I really wouldn't be able to take being called an evil god now.
[k]

＠Ishtar
The real thing is wandering around, and we don't even know where it came from, right? I don't want it thinking we're pals or anything...
[k]

＠Ishtar
Just because I'm the goddess of Venus doesn't mean you can lump me in with weird sci-fi stuff like floating octopi and tentacles!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Ishtar
Whatever. I feel like taking a break today.[sr]I'll let all that offensive stuff slide this time.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Anyway, why are you here? As you can see, the only thing that's around is this weird upside-down castle...
[k]

？1：I'm just sightseeing. And also trying to get chocolates.
？2：I'm just trying to get chocolates. And also sightseeing.

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ishtar
I see. Chocolates and sightseeing. You're so greedy, wanting both, [%1]☆
[k]

＠Ishtar
This place does look like it could be a world heritage site, so I get it. Even I was drawn here.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Ishtar
But unfortunately, there were no shops or specialty products or even a treasury... The only things here are doves and a chocolate fountain...
[k]

＠Ishtar
Today's Valentine's Day, so I get that there would be chocolates...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Ishtar
Valen...tine's...Valen...tine's...getting chocolates...coming to...me...?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Ishtar
Oh crap![sr]The person you're trying to get chocolates from is ME!?
[k]

？1：That's right.
？2：I'd like something in return for all the offerings I've made.

？！

[charaFace A 11]

＠Ishtar
(Ugh... [&He's:She's] serious. There's no way I can say I forgot. Even an evil god couldn't feign ignorance here...)
[k]

＠Ishtar
(But I need to do something to cover my butt...)
[k]

＠Ishtar
(I'm the goddess of beauty, so it would be SUPER embarrassing if anyone found out that I completely forgot about Valentine's Day!)
[k]

[charaFace A 15]

＠Ishtar
Y-yes. Chocolate, right?[sr]I know, I know. I've planned something for you. Really.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_2 0.5]

＠Ishtar
Um... (How do I talk my way out of this...?)
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Ishtar
Um... (Covering my butt...)
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Ishtar
Ummmmmmm... (How to cover my...butt...)
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_7 0.1]

＠Ishtar
Argh! I can't! Sorry! I'm just going to apologize![sr]I'm sorry, [%1]!
[k]

[charaFace A 18]

＠Ishtar
I don't have anything prepared![sr]I really am a useless goddess!!!
[k]

？1：Did Ishtar really just...
？2：She...said she's sorry...?

？！

[charaFace A 11]

＠Ishtar
W-well yeah.[sr]I know how important today is.
[k]

＠Ishtar
And you always listen to my selfish requests. If I don't do something to repay you, my image as a goddess would be ruined...
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Ishtar
That's why I'm apologizing, sincerely.[sr]I'm sorry I didn't have chocolates prepared.
[k]

＠Ishtar
But...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Ishtar
Luckily, the day has just begun![sr]There's plenty of time for me to redeem myself!
[k]

＠Ishtar
Okay. Time to get out my scooter.[sr]Get on back, [%1]!
[k]

＠Ishtar
You want to go sightseeing, right?[sr]Then I'll take you to all the great places!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Ishtar
This is an honor, you know.[sr]I don't just fly people around on my Maanna all the time.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ishtar
And if we fly around the world, I'm sure we'll find some nice chocolates! Let's go and find the best chocolates together!
[k]

？1：Awa...awawawawa!
？2：Helmet...where's my helmet!?

？！

[charaFace A 19]

＠Ishtar
Ready? Then let's start our tour!
[k]

＠Ishtar
Nobody else can match this! I'm going to give you the speediest Valentine's Day present ever♡
