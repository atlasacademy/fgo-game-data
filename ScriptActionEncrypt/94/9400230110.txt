Doctor. These coordinates mark the location where a Singularity is forming, correct?

Yes, enemy readings are exceeding predictions and have been confirmed in several areas.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If we don't do anything about it, it might exacerbate the separation and collapse of the Seven Eras.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It seems that Servants are being summoned in opposition, so I want you to go and help correct the era.

What a cute little Servant... So you're the Master, huh! Nice to meet you!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Astolfo
Huh?[sr]Have we met before?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Astolfo
Hmm... I forgot, but whatever![sr]So what are you doing here?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Y-Yes. We are investigating a Singularity[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Astolfo
A Singularity?[sr]I see. I think I've heard of those.
[k]

＠Astolfo
But I don't really know much myself.
[k]

＠Mash
I see... In that case, do you know any of the remaining Servants?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Astolfo
Ah!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
W-What!?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Astolfo
That's right! The reason why I called out to you![sr]Now I remember!
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Astolfo
Oh man, I was just about to forget about it, too! Heh heh.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
Please don't forget...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Astolfo
There are actually two other Servants here.[sr]One of them is a Ruler!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
A Ruler... A Ruler!?[sr]Like Jeanne d'Arc?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Astolfo
That's right, just like her![sr]The other is an Archer.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Astolfo
Umm, I can't quite recall the name...[sr]Gira...Giri...Gil...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
...Perhaps “Gilgamesh”?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Astolfo
Oh yes, that's right! Gilgamesh!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The King of Heroes, Gilgamesh... The oldest Heroic Spirit who possesses an inexhaustible amount of treasures.
[k]

＠Mash
The weapons from his treasury later became prototypes for weapons owned by other heroes in this world.
[k]

＠Mash
Or that's what Da Vinci said.[sr]I've never actually met Gilgamesh, but...
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Ah, I'm not sure.[sr]I have this feeling...that maybe I have met him...
[k]

？1：Surely it was a dream.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
A dream, huh.[sr]I see. Now that you mention it, I think you're right.
[k]

？2：I've seen him.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Really?[sr]Umm... Are you talking about Santa?
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
What are you talking about?[sr]I apologize for my ignorance...
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Astolfo
Indeed. He did seem like a child worthy of that name.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Astolfo
I'm sure in the future that child will be a great hero! But he'll also probably turn out to be a tyrant!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
So, what happened to the two of them?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Astolfo
Oh, um, you see...[sr]How do I explain...
[k]

＠Astolfo
That Ruler and Archer I met, you see... They're...waging.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Waging... What are they waging?
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_2 0.1]

A Holy Grail War.
