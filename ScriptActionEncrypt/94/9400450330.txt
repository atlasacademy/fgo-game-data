I wonder if something happened to him...[sr]I should have been the one to do all of the scouting.

I mean...that thing he rides... It's so...noisy...

No, it's presumptuous to think he would ride the whole time... I mean, seriously, why would he do that...?

Let's not be negative all the time and think something positive. We have to give some credit to the mobility of that Bear.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He could be cruising around the lower part of the island at full speed. Let's wait a little longer.

[charaTalk E]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
You're right. It is presumptuous of me to worry about him...

Shh! Quiet. Mr. Roman, do you detect anything?

Spot on, Kotarou. Something is approaching.[sr]It definitely isn't Kintoki.

It seems they really can communicate. They look a little bit higher-ranked than those earlier ones...

Then again, if you so much as whip them, they die.[sr]I wish they'd learn to be more brawny like us.

Seriously? You brought a lunchbox? You never forget, do you? And you're only a prison guard!

I didn't bring this. I plucked the head off that useless old guy back there. It's a lame liver as well.
