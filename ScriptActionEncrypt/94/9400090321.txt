I can't believe I lost... It must be because I stopped[sr]myself at only three bowls of rice this morning...

＠Uesugi Altria
By the way, this is completely unrelated,[sr]but I think my shadow is getting...thinner?

It seems like when they were summoned, factors of the[sr]generals I considered my enemies were mixed in.

Well, I was a bit groggy when I woke up, and was[sr]just casually looking into that space's composition...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...when I discovered a certain particle spreading there.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A fascinating, funny particle that infects Servant[sr]spirit cores, causing bad stuff to happen!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Wh-What was that?[sr]What kind of “bad stuff” are we talking about?
[k]


[communicationCharaFace 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Weakened status, modified memories, damaged spirit[sr]core. But out of everything that could happen this is the worst...

“You become a disappointment!”
