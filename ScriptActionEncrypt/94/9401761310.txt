Its citizens would forget the value of labor and stay holed up in their homes. Eventually, it would even lead to a decline in the birth rate.

You're entirely in the wrong here. Or at least, you feel like you are. And yet, you can't seem to stop yourself.
[k]

？！

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Your argument doesn't make sense. You're supposedly doing this all so you can take it easy, and yet that choice is itself causing you to suffer.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
And now look where you are. Like me, you're trying to distance yourself from the very festival you dedicated your time to creating.
