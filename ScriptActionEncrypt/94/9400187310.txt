[line 3]Hmm. I just bumped into you naturally, it seems.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Scáthach
You always look so busy all the time.[sr]It's hard to run into you without some twist of fate.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Scáthach
But bumping into each other like this...[sr]Is this what a Master and Servant are like?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Scáthach
...Well, no need for a long conversation.[sr]Even I will adjust myself to those around me today.
[k]

＠Scáthach
You are a busy person too, no?[sr]Just hurry up and finish your business.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Be grateful and accept this. I, Scáthach, made chocolate for the first time, in accordance with the customs of the day.

＠Scáthach
...H-Hmm.[sr]How can I put it... This is beyond embarrassing.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Scáthach
But, seeing you with the chocolate is worth all the effort.[sr]My trembling is a small matter compared to that.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Scáthach
Ahh, Also. I'll tell you beforehand not to criticize my work.
[k]

＠Scáthach
It's probably not sweet and tastes awful.[sr]Regardless, I am confident about its effects.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Scáthach
Huh. Anyway, it's a chocolate that goes straight for your heart. I'm sure it will be effective.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Scáthach
Hmm. It was a delightful time making this.[sr]I...was so excited, like a little girl.
[k]

＠Scáthach
It was just for a short time but I thought it would be good to perfect my cooking, in addition to my martial arts.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Scáthach
What, that's not like me, you say?[sr]...Hey. Don't laugh.
[k]

＠Scáthach
I told you. It was after I got excited like a little girl.[sr]I have a bit of a soft spot too, okay?
