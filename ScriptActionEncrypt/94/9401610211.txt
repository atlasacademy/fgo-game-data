＠Archer of Shinjuku
Chaldea's Master and [&his:her] Servants managed to stop the out-of-control Valkyrie.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Oh, and the Valkyrie is quite safe. Her Spirit Core, too.[sr]In the end, she did not use a Primordial Rune.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Though this is indeed an interesting case study...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
It all, luckily, ended well.[sr]As to what caused her to go berserk in the first place...
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
El-Melloi had some idea, but unfortunately he couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was.

The important bit is that Chaldea is safe and sound.

It turned out not to be possible[sr]to locate another Holy Grail.

It's being held so everyone can relax.[sr]After all, everyone deserves a breather once in a while.

＠Amakusa Shirou
On the other hand...

Perhaps a minor bit of wickedness like that is more relaxing to you than anything else.

Not running away or hiding is unlike you. Have your habits changed now that you've become a Servant?

Either way, you are the culprit.[sr]You were the one who caused Brynhild to go berserk.

No physical evidence, obviously.[sr]I would not expect you to be so careless.

＠Holmes
But of course, I did come across the truth.[charaFace C 6][sr]Besides, Lord El-Melloi was the detective today.
[k]

＠Holmes
The reasoning via magecraft techniques approach is certainly interesting. But either way...
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Holmes
Even if there is no clear-cut evidence, there are always ways to find the culprit.

＠Holmes
While such a thing may be impossible for an ordinary man, it is surely not so for the Great Detective. I trust I needn't elaborate?
