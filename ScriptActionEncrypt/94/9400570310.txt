＠Mash
Um, Senpai.[sr]So far, we've managed to obtain our food on-site.
[k]

＠Mash
However, we are getting sick of simply barbecuing the food.
[k]

＠Mash
A few of the crew are suggesting we build a proper cooking facility.
[k]


？1：Good point.
？2：Yeah, I'm getting sick of barbecue too.
？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Also, I've found a small quantity of grains deep within our supplies.
[k]

＠Mash
If we have a proper cooking facility, we may be able to make something else.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
So, determining what type of facility to build...

...That's the big question.[sr]The problem is definitely boiling up.
[k]

＠Altria
It is as if you were being requested for reinforcements by three different troops.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]
＠Altria
If one is chosen, the other two will be sacrificed. Ugh...[sr]Must I pass royal judgment here too!?

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Of course, us reliable Japanese Heroic Spirits recommend a standard kamado stove!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
It is the perfect embodiment of practicality and versatility, and it makes a perfect fire to cook rice!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
“First use low heat, then switch to high halfway through.” Just recite that incantation then steaming hot rice will appear!

“And don't take off the lid even if your baby cries.” Baby... The one belonging to Master and me? Hehe...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
We'll leave Kiyohime off in la-la-land for now. Anyway, if we want to eat rice, a Japanese stove is the best!

White rice. White rice. Sounds good.[sr]Very...good.

＠Marie
Um, you know what? I think we should make an oven that we can make pizza in.

Marie, I didn't know you like pizza.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Marie
No, that's not what I meant. I don't know.[sr]I've never eaten one before.
[k]

？1：Really?
？2：Bet you've had tons of cake though... Never mind.
？！

[charaFace F 0]
＠Marie
I've had some flat bread, of course, but nothing quite like pizza, you know?
[k]

＠Marie
But I was watching Drake and the others at Chaldea enjoy some the other day...
[k]

＠Marie
...and I saw Caesar stuff his face with pizza and soda once too...
[k]

＠Marie
So I've always wanted to try it.
[k]

＠Marie
But Sanson and Amadeus would always come in and say, “Marie, you mustn't eat such junk!”
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
I'm sure they didn't want you to end up like Caesar.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Marie
See? So please! Since Sanson and Amadeus aren't on this island, I want to try a pizza!

Pizza sounds good, yes, but that thing's a pain to bake.
[k]

＠Mordred
What's important is the quantity.[sr]I think we should have at least one huge-ass pot first.

Only Master's opinion is left at this point! Now, please choose which one to make! Listen to your stomach!
