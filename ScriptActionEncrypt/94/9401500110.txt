There's a certain lord in charge of it,[sr]and she's running it right into the ground.

[charaFace A 8]

＠Ishtar
Its land has gone barren, its ground burns day and night, its people have gone berserk, and in all that mess, only the lord grows fatter.
[k]

＠Ishtar
My guess is that this small fry succumbed to greed and transformed the place when she took it over, making it her own.

＠Ishtar
At first I thought I'd just take care of it myself,[sr]but as luck would have it...

＠Ishtar
This lady's got a number of Heroic Spirits working for her, which of course complicates matters.

If this ritual succeeds, the Singularity will be destroyed, and this so-called lord will basically self-destruct in her own castle.
