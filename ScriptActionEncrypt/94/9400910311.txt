...The founders of the Fuuma clan were “ijin.”[sr]Which is to say, they were not from Japan.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I'm told my father was a large, red-haired, blue-eyed Westerner.

[charaFace C 4]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
For the founders, the fading memories of their homeland must have been hard to endure.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
It is the same with the children born here. We can no longer speak the language of our forefathers.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
So the least we can do is to use a few (cool-sounding) words of that language to bring them peace...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Such sentiment is embedded in my Noble Phantasm...[sr]So I can't change it.

No, she doesn't seem to. She's trying to do it right, but...it is sad, too.

She focuses on usefulness because she doesn't know what kind of gifts bring joy.
