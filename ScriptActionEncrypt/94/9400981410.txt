＠Paracelsus
Yes...? Is anything the matter, Master? Today is...
[k]

＠Paracelsus
It appears to be the holiday known as Valentine's Day.[sr]A few male Servants looked anxious.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Paracelsus
Haha, I wonder how Saint Valentine feels about this. I seem to recall he was a saint who passed away in the latter half of the third century.

＠Paracelsus
Oh, speaking of which, I hear that there are actually two saints called Saint Valentine.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
On top of that, there was also some obscure monk by that name.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
In modern times, Valentine's Day seems to have settled on the fact that it is a celebration based on some clergyman.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Paracelsus
And if you go even further back in history, there was an ancient Roman festival calling for an abundant harvest known as Lupercalia...
[k]

＠Paracelsus
Or that particular date is said to be the first day when birds begin to mate...
[k]

？1：How do you feel about this, Paracelsus?
？2：What do you think about Valentine's Day?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Paracelsus
Ah, yes. I believe it is a special day for people of modern times like yourself.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Paracelsus
That is why[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Paracelsus
My wish is that you can spend this day with someone special to you. Therefore, you mustn't be hanging around here.
[k]

？1：Well if that's the case...
？2：Happy Valentine's Day!

？！
