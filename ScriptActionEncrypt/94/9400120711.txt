My plan to take over the role of protagonist[sr]and grab the star of glory is ruined!

But this solves the problem. The fake Santa is gone and[sr]will never deceive people again.

＠Santa Alter
There's another Red Saber...[sr]Someday, I'll have to settle things with her.

？2：A Christmas Eve Miracle?
