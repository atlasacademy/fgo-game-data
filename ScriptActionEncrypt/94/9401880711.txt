＠Ishtar
If you've got the guts to go toe-to-toe with super me, you should be able to face Ereshkigal without just dying instantly, at least.
[k]

[charaFace C 8]

＠Ishtar
Fine, go on down to the abyss if that's what you want. But what are you gonna do about the gate?
[k]

＠Ishtar
I was planning to smash through it, but I don't have any magical energy left after that battle.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Do you have a way to break it? Come to think of it, how'd you get past all the other gates, anyway?

Now that the last gate is open, there's nothing standing between you and the abyss[line 2]the primal sea that was once home to Enki, the god of wisdom.

So don't think you need to conserve your magical energy or anything. Don't worry about what might happen; just go talk some sense into her!

Besides, thanks to these sheep, I think I've got a pretty good idea of why it's all Christmasy down here.

So maybe, juuust maybe...
