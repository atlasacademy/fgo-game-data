＠Nero
It is a party that brings joy to all people, regardless of the era or place!

The same can be said for my festival! It can already be considered a spectacle that both Rome and Chaldea are known for!

“But that's not the true meaning of a festival,” you say? Umu, I shall leave that distinction to the scholarly Servants.
