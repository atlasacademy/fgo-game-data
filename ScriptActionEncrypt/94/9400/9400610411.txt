Quite persistent, wasn't it. It was on a completely different level than the other demon boars we've met so far.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Scáthach
Just like the giant demon boars from the other island,[sr]it was a monster that reached the level of a Phantasmal.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Normally it should only be found on the reverse side of the world, or it would have long been extinct.
[k]

＠Scáthach
But it's here in this world, and it's building strength.

...Is it possible that this island is isolated from everywhere else?
[k]

＠Scáthach
There are plenty of heroes who have seen the whole world.
[k]

＠Scáthach
And a greedy mage would never ignore a land with demonic beasts of this rank wandering around.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Scáthach
...In that case, the possibilities are narrowed down for us. Now, let's walk a bit further.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Wait a second.[sr]The demon boar was protecting this tree.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Shouldn't we investigate it before we[line 3]
[k]

＠Scáthach
There's no need.[sr]That's an ash tree.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
...What?
[k]

＠Scáthach
Now let's go.[sr]If it's still intact, it shouldn't have weathered away.

Mash, this isn't an inextricable mystery.[sr]Everything is quite simple and obvious.

Considering the state this statue is in, one thing is perfectly clear: this is the same island as before.

We set sail and continued along a straight course, but ended up back where we started.

Not only that, but time here passed at an incredible rate while we were gone.
[k]

＠Scáthach
And so when we, oblivious to all that, returned to this place...
[k]

＠Scáthach
...little did we know that some 2,000 years had already passed.

This island is probably special.[sr]Time doesn't progress normally here.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Scáthach
Even if you spend a year on this island, only a fraction of that time passes in the outside world[line 2]that is, everywhere but here.

？2：How do we get out of here?

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 1]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Scáthach
Yes, the first thing to consider is a means to escape safely. As expected from our Master.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Scáthach
It's true that we've solved the mystery of this island, but as to how we escape it...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Scáthach
Well, I'm sure it'll be fine. We'll find a way out as we solve more mysteries.
[k]

？！

＠Scáthach
At any rate, this world has been cut off from “our world” for 2,000 years now.
[k]

＠Scáthach
No heroes or mages existed here.
[k]

＠Scáthach
It was just a world where the boar piglets lived in peace.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Scáthach
But then the intruders came.

I see.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
We lived on that island and established a civilization, and so the boar piglets awakened to that concept as well.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...However, isn't their civilization a little too advanced?

[charaFadeout D 0.1]

[charaFace B 4]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Scáthach
It is, yes. That's also something worth thinking about...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Scáthach
Anyway, over the course of 2,000 years, the boar piglets built up an advanced civilization on this island.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

They must have taken good care of that statue too.[sr]We built it, after all.
