＠Bedivere
Hello, Master.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I look forward to working with you today.[sr]I shall humbly accompany you wherever you please.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Shall we Rayshift?[sr]Or perhaps train in the simulator?
[k]

＠Bedivere
You seem to be very busy every day, so resting may also be a good option.

Oh, by the way, Master.[sr]It has been a while since your last medical check.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Why not go to the medical room and rest for today?
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Bedivere
I shall, of course, accompany you.
[k]

？1：Here, take this!
？2：Surprise! Happy Valentine's Day!

Th-this is...?
[k]

＠Bedivere
Master? What? This is... What have you given me?
[k]

？1：They're chocolates.
？2：Don't you know about Valentine's Day?

？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠Bedivere
Valentine's... Isn't it an ancient Roman event...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Bedivere
Yes. I have heard of it.[sr]It was about a saint who died for his beliefs.
[k]

＠Bedivere
His name and actions had aligned with traditional harvest festivals, which evolved into a new event.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Saint Valentine's Day.[sr]A day for lovers.
[k]

＠Bedivere
And according to modern custom, one gifts chocolate to those who are important to them.
[k]

？1：Bingo.
？2：Chocolate. Chocolate.

＠Bedivere
Thank...you...
[k]

＠Bedivere
B-but is that truly acceptable?[sr]I am but a Servant.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I am not actually a true Heroic Spirit. I have done nothing of significance to be recorded in human history.
[k]

＠Bedivere
So for someone like me to receive a gift from you[line 3]
[k]

？1：Thank you for everything.
？2：From the bottom of my heart.

？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠Bedivere
...Thank you very much, my Master.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Um... I do not know what to say... My apologies.
[k]

＠Bedivere
I-I'm terribly sorry, but could you wait a moment?
[k]

＠Bedivere
I'm a bit embarrassed to say this, but I...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Bedivere
I...I also prepared a Valentine's Day gift.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Bedivere
But as one who is in your service, I thought it would not be appropriate to gift you something as if we were intimate.
[k]

＠Bedivere
And so I had stashed it away in my room.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Bedivere
But, allow me to present you with a token of my gratitude.
[k]

＠Bedivere
Master. Though you may not be king, this is for you, who is my lord.
[k]
