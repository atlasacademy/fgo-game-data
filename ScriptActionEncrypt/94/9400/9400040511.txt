？1：We'll see her again.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
You're right. Even if none of us remember what[sr]happened tonight, I'm sure we'll be able to get along.

？2：I hope we can see her again.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
We will. She loves humanity so much.[sr]I'm sure we'll see her soon.
[k]

＠Mash
I know she said she didn't like humans, but I'm[sr]sure that's just because she can't leave us alone.
