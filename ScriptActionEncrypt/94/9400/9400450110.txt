＠Mash
Doctor, I brought Senpai.[sr]What did you want to talk about?
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Thank you. Sorry for the short notice, but we have a problem. I've just detected the development of a peculiar Singularity.
[k]

？1：Thought so. Where is it?
？！

＠Dr. Roman
Well, about that...[sr]It's in Japan.

＠Mash
Really... Again?
[k]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 4]

＠Dr. Roman
Yes, again. What's more, it's not that far off in time from when you were in Kyoto.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Normally, this era of Japan would have nothing to do with the Foundation of Humanity[line 2]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
However, if left alone, this abnormality could contradict that.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Dr. Roman
We've encountered unusual circumstances before, but this one takes the cake.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I can't even predict what kind of situation awaits you at your Rayshift destination.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
All I can do is prepare for whatever you encounter.[sr]Will you still go, [%1]?
[k]

？1：Of course.
？2：You can count on me!

？！

＠Dr. Roman
Excellent! That's very reassuring. At this rate, I can't really call you a rookie Master anymore.

＠Dr. Roman
Haha, according to Mash, Chaldea's very own lucky animal.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Only Mash really knew Fou before [%1][sr]arrived, huh? Even named him. I guess he's an essential member of the team now.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Dr. Roman
All right, Fou, please take care of these two.[sr]I'll give my best to support you guys from here as well.
