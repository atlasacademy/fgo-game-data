Well, that's that. It's over.[sr]That didn't measure up to Heaven's Feel at all.

Well, you were close, anyway. But how lucky it was for us to run into a real Master in a place like this.

＠Amakusa Shirou
If, someday, we are able to form a real contract between us, I hope I will be able to serve you well.

I will gladly work with you to grant my own dream as well.

Well, if it is in our fates to meet again, good tidings to you from Astolfo of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne!

If you'll kindly summon me, I'll give you a good, thumping shoulder rub! See you!

But I think, maybe, I could be more helpful than my adult form would be?

Yes. I'd really like it if, next time, you could judge which of us is the better Servant, Master!

Even among us Servants, there are those with dreams and ambitions of their own. Some will betray their Masters to achieve those dreams.

＠Amakusa Shirou
But the path walked by that “king” was no dream. The incineration of an era and the destruction of the world are hardly “dreams.”

Thus, something inside him must be irreparably broken. ...No, perhaps there's nothing inside.

There seem to be no exploitable weaknesses in his overwhelming power[line 2] Even so, perhaps I can be of service to you.
