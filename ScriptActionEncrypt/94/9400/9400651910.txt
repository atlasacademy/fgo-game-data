That is correct.
[k]

＠Fake Altera
I am one of those who manifested in this Reality Marble as a magical girl who was unfulfilled.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Fake Altera
But I stood out because I was too strong, and so I was ganged up on and defeated.

Perhaps we should see how far I can ram my Photon Ray down it?
[k]

＠Fake Altera
Humph. It's true that defeat and submission are humiliating.

？！

＠Fake Altera
But listen! I stand here by my own free will.

[charaFace D 5]
＠Fake Altera
Magical girls are bad civilization.[sr]They must be destroyed.
[k]

＠Fake Altera
If you have any rivals in the same season, you must defeat them. When you're over 12, you're automatically fired.
[k]

＠Fake Altera
Mid-season you are required to ride a bus or go to the pool. You work Saturday mornings for 10 years straight. No, that's fine.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Fake Altera
Do you understand? A civilization filled with competition like that will someday collapse.
[k]

＠Fake Altera
Now that my self-interest as a Servant has been shorn away and I've been reborn with the power of a stick.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Fake Altera
It's no exaggeration to say that I have surpassed my title of Great King and become the God of War.
