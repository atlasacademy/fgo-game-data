I've cut the beast's bowel open, but I did not find our crops. The true culprit lies elsewhere.

Well then, let's search for some. We'll use them to investigate the cause of the damage and, if possible, rid ourselves of it.

Very well. It is not something I usually openly show, but I guess it was meant to be.

Now, behold the wisdom that flows from within me.

This is an extremely high DHA response! It's an unbelievably condensed DHA reaction not possible on Earth!
[k]

＠Scáthach
I don't know what I'm saying myself, but the analyzing skill obtained from the Wisdom of Dún Scáith is telling me that!

Normally, blue-backed fish contain a higher percentage of DHA than salmon. But what on earth is this... Salmon of Wisdom...?

A-Anyway, Fionn.[sr]Did you find anything?

[bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Fionn
Yes. First of all... we have firm evidence that some kind of beast destroyed our crops.
[k]

＠Fionn
A clear mind is sensitive to smell as well.[sr]The faint smell of an animal can support my claim.
[k]

＠Fionn
There is no mistake. The culprit is a beast, not a human. From the footprints, it is likely a four-legged beast.

？1：Wow! And what might that be?
？2：Salmon DHA is just awesome...

？！

Diarmuid, we must stay up and watch over this crop field. What came before will come again.

The culprit is a beast.[sr]But I do not know what kind or where it is right now.
[k]

＠Fionn
So we have to see it with our own eyes...[sr]That's the answer my wisdom has led me to.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Fionn
My wisdom can help me solve mysteries, but it can't unconditionally tell me something completely unknown.
[k]

＠Fionn
If that were the case, I would have already known about this island or how to get back to Chaldea.

[charaFace C 5]
＠Fionn
...Wrong. I did need to.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Fionn
We must stay up and watch over the crop field...[sr]That was the conclusion I came to after analyzing all the clues. That's the important part.

[charaFace B 12]
＠Mash
Huh? I'm sorry, I still don't understand...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Fionn
Good grief. Then let me whisper it into your ear.
[k]

＠Fionn
There are many attractive, scantily clad women on this island. It's not just you and Lady Scáthach here.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Fionn
To be honest, I was thinking it's probably about time for me to run into some kind of lady trouble at night.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Fionn
Therefore, I am doing this to also keep us away from the ladies and cool down for a bit. I think.

I don't really understand... But it seems Fionn and Diarmuid have their own troubles to deal with... I mean, their own way of showing consideration.

[charaFace B 13]
＠Mash
For now, let's leave it to them for tonight, and come back tomorrow to take a look at the crops, Master.
