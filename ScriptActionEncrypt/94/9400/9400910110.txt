Somehow, it was as frightening as the beginning of the world, but as beautiful as the end of all things.

A gift that, supposedly, was never meant to be, was being opened before my eyes.

＠
...In the end, I was probably a failure as Santa.

That's why I'm sure these tears are tears of frustration.

Senpai, are you ready to go?[sr]That reindeer outfit really suits you!
[k]

？1：Thanks.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Oh, you forgot something important.[sr]Here, your red nose.
[k]

？2：Is that a compliment?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Yes! Of course!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I have sort of a care package for you from all the Servants.
[k]

＠Mash
We expect you to be out for a while, so please take it with you.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
First... This is a portable heater.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
You'll be flying at over 7,500 meters, so this will make sure you don't get cold.
[k]

＠Mash
It's made with Medea's magecraft, so it will definitely keep you warm!
[k]

？1：How helpful!
？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
And this is a lunch from Emiya.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
If you pull this string, it will automatically warm up.
[k]

＠Mash
He developed it together with Edison, or so he said...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Oh, the one flaw is that it emits a strong smell of dumplings, so be careful when you eat it.
[k]

？1：Rocket dumplings...
？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
And this is from Marie.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
“It's a little early for Christmas, but this is warm spiced wine,” she says.
[k]

＠Mash
“I'll put it in an insulated case, so drink it when you find yourself getting cold.”
[k]

？1：This is all so thoughtful...
？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
And lastly, Senpai, this is from Santa Alter and me.
[k]

＠Mash
It's a talisman we made together. It's meant to give many effects, such as safe travelling...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
At least, I hope it does.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Oh, and I have a message from Santa Alter.[sr]“You'd better not make her cry,” she says.

I need to undergo emergency maintenance, so I'm staying here with the doctor...

All the younger Servants are starting to get excited.[sr]I mean, so are the adults.

Why are they getting all excited for? Can you even call that candy-loving book a legendary hero who left a mark on history?
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

Ugh... Those so-called “real Servants” are satisfied with merely existing, and not at all interested in bettering themselves.

[charaTalk D]

＠Gilles

On the contrary, when I see the children get excited, it makes me want to smile.

Though for reasons I can't quite understand, my smile seems to frighten children!

When Christmas comes, she starts getting excited.

Who is “she”?
[k]

[charaTalk C]
＠Jeanne Alter
Don't you know?

[charaFace C 2]
＠Jeanne Alter
That awful, dark Santa with the skin the color of a corpse!
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Jeanne Alter
Last time I was just walking through the halls when I almost got blown away!
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
“You aren't looking where you're going, fallen saint. Can't you tell I'm in the middle of tuning my Llamrei Mark II?”
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
“Of course you can! It's almost Christmas! It's almost time for Christmas fun. My sword shall save the world once more!”
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Jeanne Alter
She said it twice! She just wouldn't shut up!
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
And then she went into the combat simulator and started humming “Jingle Bells” while blasting off her Noble Phantasm for hours before finally going home.
[k]

[k]

[charaFace C 0]

So I'm going to steal[line 2]ahem, borrow[line 2]Santa Alter's sack.
[k]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 2]
＠Gilles
What? The sack she uses to carry presents!?
[k]

[charaTalk C]
[charaFace C 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
That's right. And then I'm going to hand them out before she can.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

The children will cry. Santa Alter will cry.[sr]It will be my best Christmas ever!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
Do you see now, the genius of my plan?
[k]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 0]
＠Gilles
But, my Jeanne...
[k]

＠Gilles
If I may point out, even if it is the middle of the night, she is still a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Gilles
And we do not even have Presence Concealment.[sr]Won't it be quite difficult to steal from her?
[k]

[charaTalk C]
[charaFace C 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
Hmph. You underestimate me, Gilles!
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Don't worry! The cute little kiddie King of Heroes gave me a potion that makes you invisible!
[k]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 1]
＠Gilles
Ooh! So that the pitch-black potion you've been holding...!?
[k]

[charaTalk C]
[charaFace C 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
Yep. I'll turn invisible, steal her sack, and then spend the whole night delivering presents! It's foolproof.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
And tomorrow, when the children are happily opening their presents, I will feast on the sweet salt of Santa Alter's tears[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
[fontSize large]SERVES YOU RIGHT!
[k]

[charaTalk D]

[k]

[charaFace C 0]

[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
How strange. I'm suddenly a little...nervous for some reason...
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
It should be safe, right? I was careful not to ask the scary evil Gilgamesh and chose the dumb kid, as a precaution.
[k]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 1]
＠Gilles
Yes! I have no reason to be confident about that, but I am willing to bet your life on it!

[charaTalk C]

Gilles, feel free not to say everything that comes to mind.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
But that's fine. If I stopped to worry about consequences, I wouldn't be a Servant.

I am the witch of vengeance. Even if I've been tricked into taking poison, I'll still laugh and gulp it down.[sr]All the potion. All of it.
