Kiyohime... Why are you here?

I will always appear wherever you, [%1]... No, wherever Anchin is.

I mean[line 3]I yearn for my Anchin, follow him everywhere, and corner him. I am his faithful, loving dog!

That's not a faithful dog! That's called a hunting dog!

Of course I don't. I have no interest in being a feeble pheasant or a vulgar monkey.

＠Kiyohime
They say dogs are honest. I hate lies more than anyone, so the role of the dog is a perfect fit for me!
[k]

＠Kiyohime
But still, ohh[line 2] How could a woman other than I be Anchin's dog?

[charaFace G 8]

＠Kiyohime
I bet every night this bitch whimpers like a dog, barking “Woof, woof!” and being rewarded with rubs...
[k]

[charaFace G 9]

＠Kiyohime
I bet that's the kind of play that you've been having![sr]I cannot forgive such shamelessness!

Just thinking about it makes the flames of jealousy spew from my lips!

You are mistaken, Kiyohime!

It is true that I have taken the role of the dog, but we have not done a single shameless thing.

＠Ushiwakamaru
The only rewards that my lord gives me are a good stroke for a job well done.

[charaFace D 2]

That's all!
