＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Now that the development of the island has progressed quite nicely...
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I would like to propose that we build a lookout from which we can gaze over the whole island☆
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Looking down on the island from high up... The cool breeze blowing... My mind filled with precious memories of the person standing next to me... [charaFace E 3]Awww.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
It will be a romantic building that will surely make you blush. Don't you think so too, Master?

＠Scáthach
Hm. Romantic or not, it could serve many purposes. Building a tower of some sort is a nice idea.
[k]

＠Scáthach
The question is what material to use.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Yes! I'll go first. I believe a five-story pagoda, lavishly made of the best-quality wood, would be the most appropriate thing to build!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Its color, its beautiful shape, the seemingly[line 2]no, literally[line2]pointless number of roofs... It's the epitome of Japanese high society.

＠Anne
Wait a minute. We are building the first tower for this island, right? If so, then a lighthouse is the only way to go.
[k]

＠Mary
I agree. We should think about what our priorities are, Master.

A tower, eh? The ideas you guys come up with are always lame.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Mordred
Here, I'll design it for you... (Rustle, rustle)[sr]How about this!?

Thank you for the sketch... [charaFace A 15]Oh my. This is...

＠Mash
No, I mean... I'm sure some people think stuff like this is attractive, but why, of all things, would you choose it over[line2]

Hehe, if we're talking surfers, then it's all about rock 'n' roll! Don't you think this tower rocks?
