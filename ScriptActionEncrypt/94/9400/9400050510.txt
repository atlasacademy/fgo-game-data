[line 2]Hmm, so you made it this far, huh?

＠Vlad III
Carmilla went easy on you...[sr]Or perhaps not.

[charaFace E 1]
＠Vlad III
Very well then. I grant you the honor of fighting with[sr]Vlad Tepes, the Dracul.

Oh my. We actually ran into a serious warrior for once.[sr]Class-wise, he's the same as me, though.

Of course, no Berserker can rival me in elegance and breeding.

You make me laugh, man-eater.[sr]Your sin will scorch you from within.

Both you and I have trod a wicked path.[sr]Know that neither of us shall return to the light.

Even the jesters must give it their all.

As the ruler of a nation, I know the importance of[sr]festivals. Man needs circuses as well as bread.

[line 3]I find that a touch rude.[sr]I consider myself a gentleman with a sense of humor.
[k]

＠Vlad III
Mata Hari's dance was one of mirth.[sr]Carmilla's dance was one of suffering.
[k]

＠Vlad III
I would like to add a dance of my own, a dance of blood...
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Vlad III
But I must beg your forgiveness.[sr]I'm afraid I'm much better at embroidery.

Hahaha! How kind of you, milady.[sr]But no, this was the work of a special tailor.

I wanted to try my hand at it myself, but I had my position to think of.

Young girl, if you like, I shall give you a lesson later.

But first, we must attend to the battle.[sr]I've been asked to “hype up this party,” you see.
[k]

＠Vlad III
And the best way to liven up this banquet, I believe[line 2][sr]Is with your screams.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Vlad III
Let us begin with an appetizer.[sr]Eat, as your bones scream in pain!
