＠Phantom
To think you would follow me this far... You must know that I am made of death from head to toe!
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Phantom
But I will escape without making a sound.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Phantom
I shall escape through the rift between truth and lies, the stage and the dressing room, and both sides of the world!
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Phantom
And everything I do is for you![sr]For you, my diva!

He makes even less sense than that beard guy.[sr]I'm not sure who he means by “diva.”
[k]


？1：Maybe he means a magical girl!?

I think Fou is saying, “That's exactly right.”

Indeed. A whisper is a primitive spell. But the beautiful voice of a songbird, one that stirs the heart? Now that's something truly bewitching.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Phantom
Songs are true magic. Songs are true magic. A beautiful singing voice raises a girl's magic to its highest potential.

I'm starting to think we have no reason to stop Phantom.

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
It seems to me he is seriously thinking about magical girls. Don't you think?

I don't know about that. If being “serious” makes something okay, then most criminals are serious about what they do, too.
[k]


？1：Then let's ask Phantom.

Let me ask you a question. What would you do with a little bird that stopped singing?

Wait for it to sing, whisper to it to help it sing, then kill it.

Kill... What[charaFace A 14] if it were a hummingbird that always had an unpleasant voice?

＠Phantom
It should cut out its own tongue, jump into a furnace, and turn itself into grilled chicken. Or perhaps explode.
[k]


？1：How about a robin with an angelic voice?
？！

[charaFace E 1]
＠Phantom
Ooh! That would be my Christine![sr]She must stay with me...
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Phantom
...in a tightly sealed room where the sun never shines, filled with stone and chains and leather!
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Phantom
Until the moment when she dies, and her love is filled with the flames of hatred and the desire to kill!

Looks like we should try to convince him with a song.

Hahaha. That's right.[sr]Even birds that can't fly have the right to sing.

Nonsense. But entertaining nonetheless.

You've gotten my hopes up.[sr]But will my ears judge your songs worthy?
