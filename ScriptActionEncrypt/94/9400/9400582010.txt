Ooooh☆ Looks like we'll be able to get some marvelous woolen cloth now. Thank you, Master!

？1：Are you gonna make a wool swimsuit or something?
？2：Were you really low on clothes?

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Silly. With wool, I can make that amazing thing that is great at absorbing and retaining moisture...

？1：A good night's sleep is important...

Oh. I forgot there is an occupation called shepherding. Though if anything, I would probably be a sheepdog.

To have King David revert to his former occupation seems somewhat insolent... Would that be appropriate?
