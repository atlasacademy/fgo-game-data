Indeed, banquets are splendid.[sr]It was worth going along with that girl.

Of course. Out of all Servants, there are few who could spread such sweet delusions without shame.
[k]

？1：No, I think there are probably a lot...

？2：Well, I'm sure there's plenty...

？！

No, this isn't such a simple matter.

Even with the Grail's power, for a Servant to summon another Servant...

Be not afraid, foreign mage.[sr]We simply[line 3]answered the summons ourselves.

What she found was only a tiny sliver of the Grail.[sr]It lacks the power to incinerate eras.
[k]

＠Vlad III
She probably found it by chance during your battles at Orleans.

It must be the blessing of God that it was entrusted[sr]to the most harmless Servant there.

She has the mind of a child.
[k]

＠Vlad III
She's a very immature Servant who takes her childish thoughts and makes them real.
[k]

＠Vlad III
She acts neither for good nor evil, nor for dreams or[sr]greed. She simply seeks her own entertainment.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Vlad III
...But that's why it is fine.[sr]Her entertainment is a pure joy, unlike ours.

＠Vlad III
I know of it myself. Before I became the dragon who[sr]defended my nation, I, too, was once a father.

＠Vlad III
Now, it's time for me to fight for real.
[k]

＠Vlad III
My stakes have found their place in history.[sr]And now you shall feel their wrath!
