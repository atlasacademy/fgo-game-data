Of course.[sr]Archer is a serious threat to us as well.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
But your Servant's Noble Phantasm can defeat him.[sr]If you want to deal with him, it'll help us a lot.

＠Matou Kariya
A one-on-one battle with the Tohsaka Servant, someplace where no one else will interfere.

＠Matou Kariya
You're going to provide us that?[sr]Here, in this forest?

More specifically, at the mansion deep in this forest.

Right now, Archer, Saber, and Rider are all there having a standoff.

Um, Lord El-Melloi, doesn't that mean they're all going to fight each other?

No, it doesn't.

＠El-Melloi
All three of them have something they prize more than strategy: their pride as kings.

...I see. By the way, what is this forest?[sr]It's far away from Fuyuki's city limits.

This is an area the Einzberns set aside for the Holy Grail War. Of course, it has a powerful barrier.

Wait, is it okay for us to just walk straight into a dangerous place like that?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
It's not a problem. Rider destroyed all the alarms and defensive traps. There's no reason to worry.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Sounds like things are getting rough.[sr]What's going on inside there?

Heh. Listen to this.

They're just having a drinking party.
