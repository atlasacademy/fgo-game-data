Heheh. It costs a lot to rent, but this sphinx is the true guardian of my cavern.

Pharaoh Ozymandias may not look it, but he runs a very honest business...

“Oh, you want to borrow my army of holy beasts?[sr]Then the rental fee is three scarabs a week.”

“If you want a Marika Sphinx, add in 10 chains. Also, make sure its stomach is full when you bring it back.”
