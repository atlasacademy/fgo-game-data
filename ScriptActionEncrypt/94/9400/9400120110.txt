Emerging from the Rayshift tunnel, your eyes were met[sr]with the sight of a field blanketed in snow...
[k]

＠???
A most literary beginning. The use of the second-person lends a certain subtlety to the sentence.[sr]Don't you think, [%1]?
[k]

？1： That voice! Could it be[line 3]?!

＠Santa Alter
Ha! A lively response. I am possessed of a sudden desire[sr]to kick you in your arse.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Though our contract is but a temporary one,[sr]any Master seeking to transport me must be as so.
[k]

？1： You were in the Massive Cavern?

[charaFace D 5]
＠Santa Alter
...No. This is my first meeting with you.[sr]Can you not tell from my attire?
[k]

＠Santa Alter
I've certainly never been defeated by you, and have, under no circumstances, been brooding over it.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
I was simply in a foul mood, especially my stomach.[sr]All because Archer wouldn't cook a sound meal.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
...No, that is not it.[sr]I am precisely as you see me to be.
[k]

？2：A mi-miniskirt... Alter[line 3]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Santa Alter
...A m-miniskirt, you say?[sr]Well, I suppose one could see it as such.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Santa Alter
But mind it not, and allow me to say this in advance.[sr]One who would be Santa is unbothered by the cold!
[k]

？！

＠Santa Alter
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Santa Alter.[sr]I am a Santa Claus of Evil who slashes apart the icy breath of Midwinter!
[k]

＠Santa Alter
...You seem to misunderstand me. I merely wish to[sr]express my daily gratitude by delivering presents to all.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
However[line 3] After going through the trouble of[sr]gathering presents, I have lost my means of transporting them.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
The reindeer that I had hired previously to pull my sleigh have all run away in fear.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Santa Alter
What a bunch of cowards. All I did was use Excalibur[sr]Morgan as a jet engine to propel us into the stratosphere.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Santa Alter
I could pull the sleigh myself, but such a thing would tarnish the dignity of Santa Claus.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
I cannot capture the heart of children everywhere[sr]without a reindeer. Which is why[line 3] You understand, don't you, good [%1]?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Santa Alter
It is for that purpose alone that I have unsummoned you here by force.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
As a part of my daily gratitude to you,[sr]I bestow upon you the honor of being my reindeer.
[k]

？1： This is part of your duty as a king?

[charaFace D 5]
＠Santa Alter
No. I am not a king here, but a Santa Claus![sr]Kindly refer to me in those terms.
[k]

？2：You didn't have anyone else you could ask, did you?

[charaFace D 3]
＠Santa Alter
That is untrue! Of those I considered there was[sr]one, at least, with promise!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Santa Alter
But they were rather hesitant, and worse yet,[sr]extremely frail. Thus, I sent them packing.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
However, their eyes were so bright they would have[sr]made a perfect red-nosed reindeer...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Santa Alter
Honestly... Even if it is Christmastime, one should have[sr]limits to how much one lets loose.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Santa Alter
...No, wait a moment.[sr]It seems the presents have drawn some uninvited guests.

And I was in the middle of my presentation...[sr]But there's nothing to be done about it. Take up your sword, [%1].
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Your body shall know what it means to go into battle with Santa[line 3]!
