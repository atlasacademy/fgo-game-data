With all these feelings of gratitude, here is a special gift on this special day.
[k]

＠
Even if it's not special for that person, even if it's only natural for that person.

I don't mind if this feeling of mine is one sided,[sr]and will never be returned.
[k]

＠
For I will put my whole heart and soul into this brown pastry. I hope it will be accepted.
