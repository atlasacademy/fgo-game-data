...Mash, [%1].[sr]She looks calm, but don't underestimate that woman.
[k]

＠Orion
She's a natural predator, not just of us,[sr]but of you humans.
[k]

＠Orion
She destroys any buildings she sees, as well as some she[sr]doesn't see. She doesn't target anything of nature, but she ends up destroying it too.
[k]

＠Orion
She's a giant pain in the neck, who destroys[sr]everything around her just by walking.

That is a misunderstanding.[sr]I do make distinctions.

＠Altera
In the end, it comes to feelings.[sr]I've realized there are different types of civilization.
[k]

＠Altera
Nom, mmm.[sr]Basically, there are both good and bad civilizations.
[k]

＠Altera
Dumplings are good civilization.[sr]Moon Festival is bad civilization.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Altera
So I am taking these dumplings, nom, and destroying you for having Moon Festivals, nom.
[k]

＠Altera
If you get in my way, I will show no mercy.
[k]

＠Altera
I will use this War God's sword, I happened to find[sr]on the ground, to destroy you.
