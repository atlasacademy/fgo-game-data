Hmm. What do you want, [%1]?[sr]As you can see, I am taking a walk after my meal.

I kind of ate too many calories, and since there's no one for me to use my sword on, I am taking a walk.

Even for someone like me, I am done after eating 10 boxes of these chocolates.

But as king, I can't waste any military supplies. You need to eat every last bite, since you're my contractor.

[charaFace A 2]
＠Saber Alter
Farewell, then! Erase this from your memory after finishing the chocolate!
