...Ahhh, that wasn't enough, huh?[sr]But[charaFace D 0] that's okay.

＠Jeanne Alter
It was fun, just like that horror movie woman said.[sr]I had a lot of fun!
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
That's why this story and I shall end here.

Ahhh, this is so vexing![sr]But that's fine.

＠Jeanne Alter
The future me will form a bond with you. The current me will have a hearty laugh and go off into the sunset.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I'm sure the future me won't have any memories of being a counterfeit Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
So the current me at least wanted to make one last memory[line 2] So I wouldn't be lonely.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
...I guess it's about time.[sr]Good. [charaFace D 1]You've embarrassed me enough.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
You'd better take full responsibility...[sr]Goodbye.

Master. We've recovered a fragment of the Holy Grail.

＠Mash
Just as Elisabeth retrieved a Holy Grail fragment back in Orleans...
[k]

＠Mash
...it seems Jeanne Alter also obtained a fragment from somewhere.

Her elimination is confirmed.[sr]Now there's no more danger of counterfeit proliferation.

Good work. You can come back now. Although you could also retrieve the remaining counterfeits.

＠Emiya
Master, you were right. Sometimes there are people who just need to be defeated.
[k]

＠Emiya
There are people who can't admit defeat and move on until it's too late.
[k]

＠Emiya
She had to be defeated precisely because she has gained the qualification to be summoned as a Servant.

Yes, that's right. There are people in this world who need to be defeated before they can move forward.

Well, shall we go home? For a shut-in like me, the turmoil this time was a lot to bear!

I think you should get some exercise once in a while, Da Vinci, instead of tinkering with your strange inventions all the time.

Huh? I use an exercise bike in my room so I don't particularly need more exercise than this.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Emiya
Why, I got a clear understanding of just how athletic you are. To think you were good at close combat...
[k]

＠Emiya
As soon as we get back, King Leonidas and I will come up with a training menu to make you fit enough to stand on the front line.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Da Vinci
I don't want a total muscle-building menu![sr]If I get muscles, I'll lose this golden ratio!
[k]

＠Emiya
Don't worry. A little training and we'll send you to the front. I bet you're looking forward to that day, Master.
[k]

？1：I can't wait to have her on the team.
？2：A bulked-up Da Vinci!?

You can forget about that idea![sr]I'm not ready to go anywhere!

Unless something dire happens, I'm not going to the front! Keep that in miiiiiiind!
