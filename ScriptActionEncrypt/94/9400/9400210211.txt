Hmmm, I'm not sure.[sr]When a contract is bound to Chaldea...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The defeated Spirit Origin doesn't return to the Throne of Heroes, but to Chaldea instead.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Given some time, he'll probably return to Chaldea.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We still don't know why he was in that room, but it seems like you just “freed” a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Is that so? He was rather aggressive, but at least we've reached a solution.

＠Ryougi Shiki
As I thought, there's nothing here. This is the wrong room. Let's check the others, [%1].

＠Ryougi Shiki
What? You look sad...[sr]Don't tell me you're feeling down?
[k]

？1：Of course.
？2：I mean... Benkei's...

？！

＠Ryougi Shiki
Hey, guys. I should let you know, this apartment's always been like this, okay?
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
You can feel bad for him, but I can't do anything if you let that get to you...
[k]

[charaFace D 8]
＠Ryougi Shiki
I mean, if you guys didn't force them out, they would've gone on like that forever.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Don't you think that would've been even more tragic?

...That's right. It's just as Ryougi says.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It may be a little violent, but if a Servant attacks us, we'll have to face them as enemies.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Looks like that's our best option in this apartment. Do you understand, Mash and [%1]?
[k]

？1：...Yes I do.
？2：You're right, this room is full of pain.

We have to keep a positive mindset, no matter what. Those imprisoned here all had a negative way of thinking.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Let's keep pace and proceed with our investigation.
