As if to be expected, I'm not getting a clear visual of you. This time it's even worse than normal.

I'm guessing you can't pinpoint the cause?

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah. There are times when you travel so far back that we don't have enough data on that era...but that's not the case here.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This observation impediment doesn't follow any pattern we've seen before. It's like someone is jamming our signal.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
However, the fact remains that I'm picking up very unusual responses from that era. It's bound to turn into a Singularity if we leave it alone.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's why I sent you two to check it out.[sr]For starters, what are your surroundings like?
[k]

Right. Well, it's safe here. I mean, we've never been to a place this idyllic. Especially, um...

Cherry blossoms, huh? That's nice. I've seen them before, too. Although I didn't get to have a viewing party...

＠Mash
...On top of that, there's a kind of sweet aroma...all around... Mm...
[k]

？1：Yeah, I'd say it smells delicious.
？2：Wait, could this scent be...

？！


[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Hmmm... An aroma you say... I wonder what it could be. We definitely need more information.
[k]


＠Dr. Roman
My estimate is that you're in the Heian era right now. That said, the Heian era lasted for nearly 400 years.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Stand by while I try to pinpoint your exact coordinates. Please keep an eye on your surroundings.
[k]

＠Mash
Understood. Still...[sr]I can't get over how beautiful it is here.

Hehe. Shhh, Senpai.[sr]Caesar will appear if you bring that up again.

？！

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
But... Ummm. Actually, this has been bothering me since we got here...
[k]

＠Mash
There's a big pile of petals over there, but it's human-shaped.
[k]

It's as if someone fell asleep while viewing the cherry blossoms and was left behind for a full day...

＠Dr. Roman
Okay, if I just do this and voila... Huh?[sr]Hey, I'm picking up a Servant in your proximity.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Going by the powerful magical energy reading... No doubt about it, it's a musclehead Servant with a suffocating presence!
[k]

[charaTalk A]

＠Mash
Yes, Doctor. Mr. Golden, Sakata Kintoki himself is right in front of us.
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Oh, Kintoki is there.[sr]That would explain this strength level I'm seeing.

Oh! That's a nice greeting, Boss![sr]To be golden in the morning is very golden!
[k]

？2：God morning, Kintoki.

[charaFace C 4]

＠Sakata Kintoki
O-Oh, that's a strange mangling of the language.[sr]“God morning” sounds a little ominous.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 0]

＠Sakata Kintoki
At any rate, it's good to start off with a greeting.[sr]It shows you have good manners.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
A fulfilling day begins with a nice greeting, a nice breakfast, and nice wood-chopping.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
My boss... Oh, I don't mean you.[sr]My former boss, or I guess more like my foster parent...
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Boss Raikou, you know?[sr]She lived around here.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
She was usually lax, but very serious about table manners. Even bad sitting posture would earn a demonic glare.

Deep in the mountains, somebody called.[sr]I don't know who it is, but I'm goin' there.

All the signs point to good things, so I'll push on ahead. My axe will carve a way through the mountains. Make way for this thunderclap!
