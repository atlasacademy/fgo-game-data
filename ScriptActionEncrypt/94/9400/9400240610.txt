＠B：Avenger
You will see for yourself that human desire has no limits.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
I've never seen a man more greedy than he.[sr]It is astonishing.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Even the man who tried to offer his own daughter for wealth, money, and riches comes nowhere near him.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
His greed is for the world itself.
[k]

？1：You sound like you're having fun.

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
...Fun, you say?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
Hmmph. That's how I look to you?[sr]Then I must have very wicked tastes.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
First there was sorrow and tears. Then pain and suffering. Then he arrived to a great wish that could be called greed.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
It was never achieved, but his vengeance was the purest and noblest in the world.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
You would say I find that[line 3]fun.
[k]
[charaFace B 4]
But I do not deny it. I have given up all that is good in me.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
What is left must be like a demon.[sr]One who mocks the noble wishes of man.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
Haha. Hahaha. Fascinating![sr]Indeed, you may be right.
[k]

？2：Do you like him(?)?

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
Hmmph. Yes. I've never thought about it, but perhaps I do.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
He sought an answer. If there was no true righteous man in the world, he said...
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Or perhaps you could say he believed in nobility, and in human good, and thus denied a world where evil reigned?
[k]

＠B：Avenger
We will never know. Though, perhaps someone like you could understand him.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
Yes, he is the man who tried to do good for the entire world.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
He's very like you.[sr]He tried to save the world.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
Either way[line 3][sr]I have a certain respect for him.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
His boldness. His nobility. His greed![sr]They are worthy of acclaim!
[k]

＠B：Avenger
And thus...and thus...[sr]With the greatest respect...
[k]

＠B：Avenger
My black flames shall destroy them all. My flames burn brightest against righteousness and noble wishes.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
Be prepared, Master. You...
[k]

＠B：Avenger
You must crush this Greed that would devour the world. Kill, or be killed.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
To put it simply, yes[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
He is a tough foe. Let your guard down, and you will die.
