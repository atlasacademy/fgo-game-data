？！

＠Medea Lily
Anything you like, as long as it's something I remember. Oh, but I already know what you're going to ask.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
You're thinking I might be Medea, the Heroic Spirit of the Princess of Colchis. Correct?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Medea Lily
Well, hehe, you're wrong. It's true that I was born from Princess Medea, yes...

[charaFace E 0]
＠Medea Lily
But I'm not the Servant you think I am.[sr]Even if she exists in your world, it's a different person.

＠Medea Lily
I was merely modeled after Princess Medea.[sr]I am but a young girl's fantasy.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
I act like Medea, I get sad like her, laugh like her, and I live happily in the tiny world I was given.

The Servant System is an active summoning system, but we are passive, and born from the unconscious.

And no, no matter how much you want it, you can't have this jewel. I've named it the “Tomoi Stone.”

This stone is what supports this oceanic kingdom, and gives me my power.

This world is big, but it's also tightly closed.[sr]There were once many more magical girls here.

[charaFace E 4]

I am a healer. A medical magical girl.[sr]I have barely any means of attacking.

[charaFace E 0]
＠Medea Lily
The magical girls fought each other in pursuit of their own ideals for peace and order. It was a clash of values and worldviews.

＠Medea Lily
I tried to run from the fierce combat, but it was impossible.

I can tell. This stone is the catalyst that supports this fantasy.
[k]


？1：What of the area outside the kingdoms' jurisdiction?

？！

[charaFace E 0]
＠Medea Lily
You must be talking about the areas where the magical girls' influence doesn't reach.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
That's the neutral zone: a buffer zone born from the balance of power that all the fighting gave rise to.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
You cannot receive the blessings of your power there.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Medea Lily
Do you understand? This jewel is the only small hope I have left.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
Taking this from me would be equivalent to my death.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
So the only thing I can give you is a promise to leave you alone. Illya, I won't try to steal your jewel.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
So please leave. With that jewel you can create whatever land you want.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Medea Lily
If you want something, use your stone to get it instead.[sr]If you want friends, make a land of friends.

I was able to meet someone like that, someone as important to me as myself.
[k]

＠Illya
So I don't need anything else.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Illya
Compared to you and your wish to just live in peace,[sr]I know it's a very greedy and selfish goal, but...
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Illya
I'm sorry! Please! I came here to save my friend!
[k]

＠Illya
I'm not here to steal your jewel![sr]I don't even really know what they do!

It may seem cruel, Illya, but you cannot leave this world now.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Medea Lily
Not only can you not save your friend, there's no exit for you either. As long as you're a magical girl.
[k]

＠Medea Lily
No, you won't even have the will to leave...[sr]That's how desperate this place is.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Medea Lily
In the end, you will always be a weak magic user, a weak magical girl...
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Medea Lily
One who could only make miracles happen for the sake of her friends.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Medea Lily
So in the end, you will definitely come to rely on the power of that jewel.

It looks like she couldn't handle her guilty conscience as a healing-type magical girl, and pushed all her will to fight onto her familiar.
