＠Emiya
Yes. However, it's more accurate to say that I create a copy that's not better or worse than the original.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Emiya
No matter how similar it is to the real thing, it's never as strong. I guess fiction is too light to support the weight of reality.
[k]

＠Emiya
Although my projections must be similar to the originals. However, even if I create an identical copy, it's no more than reflections on the surface of water.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Emiya
They're nothing more than counterfeits, different from the originals.
[k]

？1：Different in what way?
？！

[charaFace C 1]
＠Emiya
It would take a while to explain everything, so let me skip that for now.
[k]

＠Emiya
However, that doesn't mean the counterfeits will always perform worse than the originals, if we're just talking numbers.
[k]

＠Emiya
If both of them perform equally well, it's not the “objects” themselves that decide which is better, but the “audience.”
[k]

＠Emiya
It's not really a nice topic for the people who made the originals...
[k]

＠Emiya
However, humans are a species that constantly aims for the future. The concept of improvement is necessary to move forward.
[k]

＠Emiya
Originals made from scratch are valuable, yes,[sr]but so are the imitations derived from them.
[k]

＠Emiya
My projections are just copies, but the imitations in this world are originals that have been developed further.

Now, after tracing and observing the Spiritron information on the counterfeits, I've concluded they came from these coordinates in this era.

Hmmm, it's been so long since I stepped outside of Chaldea. The feeling of dirt, the breeze on my cheeks...
