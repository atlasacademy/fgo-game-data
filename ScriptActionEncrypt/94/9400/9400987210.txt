Oh, Master.[sr]How are you today?
[k]

？1：Did she just...
？2：Give you some chocolates?
？！

＠Lancelot
Yes, embarrassingly.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Lancelot
Originally, Valentine's Day was a day where couples exchange gifts...
[k]

＠Lancelot
But this is troubling. There is nothing I can offer.[sr]I can only convey my appreciation, or...
[k]

？1：Or?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Lancelot
Give out single flowers.
[k]

？1：I'll take a flower!
？！

It's an iris.
[k]

＠Lancelot
I'm told it represents “hope” or “good tidings.”
[k]

＠Lancelot
I'm sure it's fitting for you, Master.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Lancelot
I can only offer this, I am sorry to say...
[k]

？1：I like it.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Lancelot
Hahaha, I'm glad you like it.[wt 0.8][charaFace A 0] And do not be saddened even if the flower wilts.
[k]

？2：I'll cherish it.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Lancelot
Thank you very much.[sr]Though, a flower will eventually wilt.
[k]

？！

＠Lancelot
Chocolates disappear once you eat them, but the sentiment that went into them lasts forever.
[k]

＠Lancelot
The same goes with flowers. At this very moment, our feelings are no doubt entwined.
[k]

＠Lancelot
Even if the flower wilts, its meaning endures forever.
[k]

＠Lancelot
Now then Master.[sr]I would like to enjoy eating the chocolates.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Lancelot
Would you care to join me?
