Have you heard of the story called[sr]“The Gift of the Magi,” Reindeer?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter Santa Lily
Personally, the truly moving moment kinda falls flat!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Jeanne Alter Santa Lily
Hair can grow out, but the special family watch is gone forever!
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter Santa Lily
From the way the story goes, the husband prolly won't be getting a new watch.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter Santa Lily
And every time the wife uses the combs, she'd feel real bad, and every time the husband see the combs, he'd feel kinda dumb.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Jeanne Alter Santa Lily
And that's bad. 'Course they wanted to be nice, but their gifts didn't make them magi, they made them dummies!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Jeanne Alter Santa Lily
...Yes, that's why this is the perfect present for her.
