N-no, wait. Please wait.

＠Martha
Wait a minute, are you crying? As a holy maiden, I cannot simply ignore someone who runs into me, starts crying, and then tries to run away.

What, you thought I would!? Seriously!?[wt 0.3][charaFace A 4][sr]...Uh, I mean, I would never do such a thing. Correct?

But what shall I do? I-I-I-I didn't realize today was Valentine's Day.
[k]

＠Martha
I didn't know! I didn't know! I didn't know![sr]I, of all people, shouldn't forget a day like today!
[k]

＠Martha
I don't even have any biscotti prepared.[sr]How could I...?
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Martha
This is all because my Spirit Origin is corrupted! Why, if only my Spirit Origin was correct and I was a proper Ruler Class...!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Martha
I wouldn't make this kind of blunder... I actually, really, honestly would be able to do things properly and correctly...
