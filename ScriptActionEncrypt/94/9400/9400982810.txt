Fine. Not that I'm her disciple or anything, but since we've got such history together, I should at least give her a scolding.

Don't give me that “this doesn't concern me” look! Sheesh.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
Listen: Valentine's Day is a day where someone hands out gifts to those they have feelings for.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
Apparently it originated from an ancient festival from the West. Something about some saint or whatnot. Something like that.
[k]


[charaFace A 0]

＠Sanzang
Oh, I know! It's like Halloween and Christmas!
[k]


[charaFace C 0]

＠Tawara Touta
Hm, it's likely related. A celebrative day where one could show their gratitude toward others. There's no doubt it's a festival.
[k]


[charaFace C 6]

＠Tawara Touta
That being the case, this isn't the time to be worked up about some secret summit, land, or adventure.
[k]

＠Tawara Touta
Come on, surely you must have someone.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Tawara Touta
There must be someone you want to show your gratitude to as an individual...not as a monk.

To Master, Mash, Da Vinci, to all the staff in Chaldea...

＠Sanzang
I also need to give you a gift, Touta, and to the other Servants as well! I can't just stand here!
[k]

＠Sanzang
With good words come good deeds![sr]I need to strike while the iron is hot!
[k]

＠Sanzang
Everyone, thank you! My gratitude isn't merely simple appreciation! It's beyond that! My gratitude is infinite!
[k]

＠Sanzang
Let's go! To give out Valentine's Day gifts!

No, it'll be okay! It probably won't disappear! After all, it's Xiwangmu's, the Queen Mother of the West's, favorite!
