＠Elisabeth
From the east, an unsightly puppy will hand me a sword if I cry! From the west, a brassy deerlet will lend me a shield if I get hurt!
[k]

＠Elisabeth
I wonder what hero that would be!?[sr]I'll give you a hint: her horns are stunningly cute!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Elisabeth
...That's not even a riddle![sr]Now come on, I need to make my appearance!
[k]

＠Elisabeth
The hero of Halloween, Elisabeth Báthory Brave![sr]I came here because I heard a call for an encore!
[k]

？1：But there wasn't a call for an encore...
？2：Hero and brave are pretty much the same.

？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠Elisabeth
I know that! I just said all that on a whim![sr]A whim! What matters is that it sounded good!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Elisabeth
...No! That's not it! Today's not that kind of day.

＠Elisabeth
Here, have this! I bet nobody has given you any, anyway.

＠Elisabeth
To keep the party members' morale high is one of the many duties of the party leader.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
A monk, from the heroic perspective of mine, is such a low-grade class. No, thank you.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Elisabeth
Well, seeing the happy look on your face isn't half bad![sr]I had to do it, so I just used what I had around.

How rude! It's still chocolate! It's a first-rate god-diva chocolate!

Besides, there's no Servant who would eat a ring. And if there was, even mathematicians would get really angry!

＠Elisabeth
Th-that's right. I thought you would be thrilled if I used the best materials.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
This is my first time doing something like this, so I didn't know exactly how to do it...but Tamamo told me:[sr]“Just don't do an octopus or a red pumpkin.”
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠Elisabeth
A-anyway, I've shown you the affection of a hero like me! I'll be waiting at the inn for your response!
