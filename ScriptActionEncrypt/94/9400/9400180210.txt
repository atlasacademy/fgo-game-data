There's an example of someone who you think might be powerful, but he's actually just another sandbag for you to practice your new moves on.

Either way, he's no threat to us.

You are like a minor character who randomly dies off in the background during a touching scene in some war flick.

You are but a candle that will go out at any moment, so there's no time for BGM.
