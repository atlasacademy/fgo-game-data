Oh, well. I guess that's it for that Holy Grail.

It was fake to begin with, so maybe it was easy to infect. Should have stored it immediately.

Should have put it under our control immediately.[sr]We should both think about what we did.

I mean, no matter how you think about it, our fight was the cause of all of this.

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
We need to take responsibility.

？1：Thanks.

[charaFace F 1]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
Got it.[sr]I'll be helping out then!

Looks like it's been completely infected. Destroying it immediately will prevent any more issues, I imagine.

I've already confirmed several Shadow Servants. It's possible it will become a Singularity if we leave it like this.

It won't nearly be on the same level as the Greater Grail at Fuyuki, but it would be terrible if it was even a fraction of that.

Yes. The one in a faraway, unrelated world, right?[sr]...Well, that aside...

We'll have one of us guard [%1]. The other two will intercept the enemy. How does that sound?

[charaFace E 5]
＠Amakusa Shirou
We'll take out the Shadow Servants first.[sr]After that we can destroy the Holy Grail.
