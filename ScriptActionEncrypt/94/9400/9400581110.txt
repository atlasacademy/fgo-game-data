＠Anne
She came to wash off the seawater, but she's going back in again.
[k]

＠Mary
It's called an infinite loop. I've heard about it.
[k]


？1：Um...
？！

＠Mary
But what's great about a shower is how easy it is.
[k]

＠Anne
Yeah. There's nothing you have to do to prepare.
[k]


？1：UM!?
？！

＠Anne
Yes?
[k]

＠Mary
What is it?
[k]


？1：Why are we all in the same shower room?
？2：It's too cramped...for three people.
？！

＠Mary
This is an experiment to see if we can use the shower properly, right? We might have missed something if we came in alone.
[k]

＠Anne
That's right. As the ones who suggested this, we have the responsibility to check it out.
[k]


？1：That's fine, but things are touching...
？2：We're like sardines in a can!

＠Anne
Hehe, we used to wash each other in the rain, didn't we Mary?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Mary
Yup, yup. That was the only fun thing to do during boring voyages. And there's something special about Anne washing me clean.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Anne
So, how about we all wash each other?

＠Mary
That's worth trying, isn't it?
