＠Kiyohime
Oh, this is like the Gojo Bridge that once existed in Kyoto! Right?
[k]


？1：Is that where Ushiwakamaru and Benkei met?

＠Mash
Correct, Senpai. If Ushiwakamaru and Benkei were here, it might have made them feel nostalgic.

＠Kojirou
Hahaha, I'm just passing by again. I have no intention of interrupting your moment of relaxation with Master.

＠Kojirou
However, they say that bridges are inhabited by evil spirits. It may be a perfect fit for you, Kiyohime.
[k]

＠Kojirou
I shall excuse myself for now. Hm, listening to the creaks of the bridge floor also gives one a sense of elegance.
[k]

＠Kojirou
But it would be most elegant if I could have a duel with an evil monk who's after my sword on this bridge. I wish it would happen to me.
[k]


？1：An evil spirit? Did you know about it?

[charaFadeout F 0.1]

？2：A Japanese-style bridge and Kojirou...[csr]A great combination.

＠Mash
Yes, it is quite picturesque.
[k]

＠Mash
By the way, Kiyohime, do you know about the evil spirit Kojirou has mentioned?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Yes, I have heard that something named Hashihime exists. It is a female oni that dwells under a bridge.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Whether it is fitting for me or not would be at the discretion of Master's.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Kiyohime
The keywords include “love,” “jealousy,” and “curse”... Something like that. Would you like to hear more details?
[k]


？1：That's pretty fitting already.
？2：I get the picture! (Sweat)
？！

[charaFace E 0]
＠Kiyohime
The story goes that if one compliments a different bridge or woman atop the bridge that Hashihime lives under, they'll be cursed to death.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Of course, in my case, I am not confined to the top of the bridge.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Kiyohime
No matter where it happens, I will never fail to hear either words of love towards me or words of infidelity towards other women.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
In other words, the whole world is a bridge called me, and Master is the one who crosses such a bridge all the time.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Kiyohime
Oh my... The idea that Master is always stepping on me somehow excites me...!
