Oh, good timing! Can you help me, Master?

＠Helena
I got a little too serious, and it turned into something unbelievable...

[charaFace A 2]
＠Helena
Oh, up! Heads up![sr]It's flying right above your head!

？1：It's a tiny silver UFO!
？2：It's flying around all crazy-like!

＠Helena
I've covered it in highly specialized foil chock-full of Mahatman blessings, so it's really resistant to magecraft!
[k]

＠Helena
There's no point trying to restrain it! It might have been easy if I had Mystic Eyes, but I don't have any!
[k]

＠Helena
Only a purely physical attack would stop it long enough to let me collect it!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Helena
But it's too hard!
[k]


？1：It keeps hovering over my head!
？2：It's SUPER scary!

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Helena
Isis-style spells would likely blast you away, and Kumara-style ones would probably smash you into smithereens!
[k]

＠Helena
I can't just hit it with powerful magecraft![sr]I might accidentally destroy you!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Helena
So please, Master! Shoot it down with something that's not so powerful as to completely destroy it!
[k]

？1：Gandr!

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Helena
Yes! Let's use that!

...Whew. Well done. Thanks.

Thanks to you, I was able to collect it without incident. Now, to do some of this...a little of that...

That'll do it. Now it won't go flying on its own.[sr]Its wrapping got a little torn, though...

But the inside should be fine.[sr]Here. A present from me to you.

Helena Blavatsky's special UFO chocolate![sr]Yep, it can travel up to two hundred kilometers an hour!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Helena
I mean, I want to emphasize that it's the real deal made with real cacao beans.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Helena
I prepared some for the geniuses and for Karna, but this particular UFO could fly the fastest.
[k]

＠Helena
This is for you, who is so spirited and straightforward.[sr]I wanted to gift a chocolate fitting for you.
[k]

？1：Thanks.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Helena
Hee hee. You're welcome.[sr]You can also have seconds.
[k]

？2：Is airspeed relevant to chocolate...?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Helena
Um. Well, you know, it means that it's full of magical energy. You must need it since you run around all the time.
[k]

？！

＠Helena
Tell me what you think once you eat it. I want you to submit your comments in a report in the Chaldean format.
[k]

＠Helena
I'll summarize the results of the experiment and share them with Da Vinci and Paracelsus.
[k]

？1：Results?
？2：Experiment?

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Helena
Oh, I'm kidding! Don't worry, eat up! But I really do want to know what you think of it, so tell me, okay?
