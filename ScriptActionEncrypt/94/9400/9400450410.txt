＠Ushiwakamaru
By the way, my lord.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Thanks to your integrity, you have gained both Kotarou and Kintoki as companions.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
When we arrived here, we went over this once, but how about we discuss our roles one more time?
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I say this as I believe if we settle it beforehand, we will be able to better fulfill our roles.
[k]

？1：Our roles?

[charaFace D 2]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Yes! The three animal companions of Momotarou, obviously! The original famed oni-exterminating companions!
[k]

？2：Oh, you mean like Momotarou's companions...

[charaFace D 1]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Yes, that's exactly right. Since we are exterminating oni, then it is a great honor!
[k]

？！

＠Ushiwakamaru
Regardless, whether we aim for the same role or not, we should declare which one we desire.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
From here onward, I think it best for our lord to decide which role is appropriate depending on our actions.

＠Ushiwakamaru
Now then, Mash, what about you?

On close inspection, you seem like you might be a bird, Kotarou. Your hair style and color kind of remind me of one.

＠Ushiwakamaru
...Are you happy with being the pheasant?
[k]

[charaTalk E]
[charaFace E 1]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
A bird... Yes, that's nice. If you don't mind me playing that role, then I don't mind.
[k]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 1]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Oh, that was a quick answer. Well, that settles the role of the pheasant. Next is Kintoki[line 2]

＠Sakata Kintoki
My name is Golden. Call me Golden. I mean, you and I have fought together in many battles.

＠Sakata Kintoki
We're already best buddies, right?[sr]So just call me by my True Name.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Also, Ushiwakamaru, I'm not so sure about making Kintoki the monkey. I mean, there isn't a monkey as strong as he is.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
If there were, then that would be the end of Japan. The future Nikko Edomura Park is still to come, you know.

＠Dr. Roman
(Yes, when it comes to Kintoki, Kotarou's eyes become quite serious...)

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 4]

＠Ushiwakamaru
...Hmm. What you say does make sense though, Kotarou.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Kintoki... I mean, Golden is best suited for the role of Momotarou.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
But our Master is in that role. Perhaps we will have to employ a double-Momotarou system[line 2]

What? The monkey role? Nothing wrong with that. I'll take it. I was raised in the mountains, so I'm perfect for it.
[k]

？1：That was unexpected...
？2：I thought he wouldn't like it.
？！

[charaFace F 0]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I don't mind at all. You don't realize how strong a monkey is, do you?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
The monkeys that lived on my mountain were crazy strong.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
They're on par with bears. There was even this one monkey I had a damn long sumo battle with.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Sakata Kintoki
He had wicked thick arms and pitch-black hair.[sr]But he had these sad eyes with a deep understanding.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
That one was a wise mountain sage.[sr]But when he got excited, he was like a storm!
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
He'd pound his chest like a drum and walk like a beast, dragging his huge fists on the ground.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
It was like all his wisdom transformed into muscle... Dang, thinkin' about this has me in the mood for some sumo!

At any rate, we've settled all three of the companions' roles! Now we can make headway as oni exterminators!

＠Kojirou
I am Sasaki Kojirou. The radiance of my secret technique was requested, so I was hired by the oni as a guard[line 2]

[charaFace G 0]

Then, based on the absurd... Nay, bold idea that “Swallows and pheasants are all birds so they are basically the same, right?”

But all I find is a spy with hair that looks like a bird![sr]This isn't what I was promised!

One, people who don't take care of their weapons.[sr]Two, subordinates who chase away the deliveryman.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
And finally, three[line 3] [bgm BGM_EVENT_3 0.1][charaFace E 8]Anyone who dares to rank my Fuuma Clan lower than Iga and Kouga!

You, sir, have crossed the line! As the fifth leader of the Fuuma ninja, I shall take that rare sword as a trophy!

However, my good Kotarou, as an apology for my impolite remark earlier, let me give you some advice.

＠Kojirou
This great oni's name is Kazakoemaru. According to the Oni King, he is heralded as the embodiment of speed.

He cannot be beaten when it comes to speed. Even up against my sword. Heed that when you face him.

That is so like you, Kintoki. Overcoming an opponent in their area of expertise, that is what you would call a true victory[line 2]Isn't that right?

It is an attack they won't see coming.[sr]It's bound to deal a huge blow to them psychologically.

However, our opponent seems pretty confident in its ability. It might be difficult to beat it if we charge recklessly[line 2]
[k]

＠Mash
In fact, if we are to take it on with speed, then I think we need to make the appropriate preparations.
[k]

＠Mash
Do we fight against its strong point, or do we try some other method? I leave the decision about that up to you, Master.

[charaFace A 1]

Whatever you choose, I will support you completely.[sr]This could be a long fight, so let's all do our best, Master!
