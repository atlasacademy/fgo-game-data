＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...Master. Master, do you have a moment?
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Hee hee. I understand how excited you are to see me, but you mustn't run through the halls like that.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
One must always be prim and proper. The only time for boisterous rowdiness is when you are slaying your enemies.
[k]

？1：Huh? Was I running?

[charaFace A 1]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...Hehe.

Being spirited is a good thing.[sr]But never forget your manners.

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
As a Master who has formed a contract with me, you are like a child of the Minamoto clan.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
You must always be mindful to behave accordingly.
[k]

？2：My apologies. I will keep that in mind, Mother.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Ah...Mother is happy.[sr]You have called me “Mother.”
[k]

If only Kintoki would be so proper.[sr]I do not know why he speaks so rudely.

...Just thinking about it makes this poor mother so sad.[sr](Sniff) He was so clingy when he was young.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I suppose you will one day grow up just like Kintoki.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I don't know if I can bear it. It is so dreadfully sad, but I must accept it as my destiny as your mother.
[k]

？！

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...Now, I hear that today is a wonderful day.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Has it gone well for you?[sr]Have you received any chocolates?
[k]

？1：I have!

[charaFace A 1]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Oh my! That is what I like to hear from my precious child.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
You are so radiantly popular, and you draw others toward you just by being you.

[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I am a little sad. You will one day sprout your own wings and leave the nest.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
It is the joy of every parent, but at the same time, it is such a lonesome feeling. My heart aches...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Mother... Mother...is about to cry.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
The sweet cuteness is so fleeting...[sr]No, you are still adorable, but...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
But we become distant. I may want to embrace you, but you are nowhere nearby...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I cannot caress you, and we speak less and less.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
... (Sniffle)
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Ahem. My apologies. I'm complaining.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...This mustn't be. The leader of the Minamoto clan must not cry like a baby.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
This is all Kintoki's fault.[sr]I wonder where Kintoki has hidden himself today.
[k]

As if it were my own.[sr]Yes. Why yes...in all sincerity.

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Valentine's. Valentine's. Ah, a special day for those who have mutual feelings for each other.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Justice, humanity, courtesy, wisdom, and truth are all there. In other words, it's love itself.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
You have no doubt gained all of it.[sr]You are loved by many Heroic Spirits.

[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...It is all right. Everyone is just embarrassed.[sr]There is no need to worry.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
There, there. You are a good child. You may not have received a single gift, but I am still here.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
You still have Mother to console you.
[k]

？！

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...Now, pull yourself together, Master.

This is a gift from your mother.[sr]Whether you've received scores of gifts, or none at all...

Just know that Mother is always thinking of you.

I am learning how to prepare dishes from this age. Everyone in Chaldea is kind and wonderful.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I was unused to that style of cooking, which made it difficult, but no task is too hard when it is done for one's own child.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Please try it.[sr]Ah, and if you can...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...I would like to hear how you liked it.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
In great detail.[sr]Take plenty of time.
