Have you learned your lesson, ruffians? The form of Santa Claus pleases me greatly but it is only a temporary one.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
My true form is that of Britain's Red Dragon,[sr]Altria, the King of Knights. Remember it well.

You there. You understand the speech of these other[sr]two, correct? Is that tree Darius, aged three, by any chance?

Since you would die before you could ever use a Noble[sr]Phantasm, use this to amass a little motivation, or perhaps a little love.

As I said, do not come near my reindeer.[sr]We are busy. We have a mountain of work to do.

＠Santa Alter
Let us go, [%1]. Santa should be as a[sr]passing breeze. We must not stay long.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
And it is painful to have to leave a party early, since my hunger is never satiated.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Well, then[line 3] Farewell, little ones![sr]Let us meet again next year! Merry Christmas!

All right. They were the perfect companions for some[sr]light warm-up. Now it's time for you to work, my reindeer.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
From now until the end of Christmas, many more battles await us, I am sure.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
At each stop, gather the stockings and bring them to me.[sr]Stockings are the crystallizations of the hearts of children seeking presents...
[k]

＠Santa Alter
It is by the power of such magical energy that Santa[sr]Claus traverses the globe. In other words, you could call it our fuel.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
The more you gather, the greater the reward I shall[sr]bestow upon you. Remember that as you go about your work.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Santa Alter
The next “Dear Santa” letter is on the 2nd.[sr]Let us build up our party until then!
