...Insolent fool. The eyes that can see death, huh? To think my servants will be disposed of so easily.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
If she's with you then you can win. I have no more reasons to stop you.

Master, Lancer Alter has lowered her spear.

Unlike the other Servants,[sr]maybe she still hasn't mutated?

Of course she hasn't. I mean, she's just not cut out for it.
[k]

＠Mephisto
How should I put this... The heart that's not afraid to go all out? The courage to pursue desires? Kind of like the class president?
[k]

＠Mephisto
No matter how strong she becomes,[sr]she never seems to turn into a cruel queen.
[k]

＠Mephisto
Unless you pour ale into the Holy Grail and have her drink it, she will never become a villain.

...Hmm. I can't let people without light tread into the darkness.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
I am here to filter the people who can't resist against the grudge in this place.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
But with that woman around,[sr]any immortal will face death.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
That's why I will allow you to proceed. Besides...
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Lancer Alter
Even with a light, it's common to be eaten by beasts.[sr]I will enjoy watching how far you can go.

Ouch, she scolded me... She's like a class president alright. Now for the necessary questions.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Heroic Spirit of the Holy Spear. Why are you here? Did Mephisto trick you into coming, too?
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
I don't know about that.[sr]I came of my own free will.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
...This is the tower that gathers grudges.[sr]It is the cenotaph that imprisons death.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
Originally it should've been drowned in the darkness of history. But someone dug it up, and tried to convert it to a Singularity.

Someone... It's probably the same person who's incinerated humanity. But you said they tried, did they fail?

...This is what you will find out from your investigation. Indeed, the King's plan ended in miscalculation.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
That's probably because he sent the wrong man for the job. As a result, this place did not turn into a Singularity.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
Instead, it became a tower that attracts and imprisons Servants, turning them into demons.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
There are many types of death that come here. Someday, it will become the Singularity called “Hell.”

＠Lancer Alter
Now, even if a Hell wasn't created here, one already exists. Adding one or two more holes to it wouldn't be a problem. However...
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
If you can't overlook that fact, then do whatever you see fit.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
This place has no effect on the incineration of humanity. The mutation of the Servants is the result of their own doing.

Oh well... We've already defeated the large chested woman, so let's go ahead [%1].
