Yes, well that kind of person is called conniving.[sr]Whereas you, Lily, are just too innocent.

I said I came to this era to save the world[line 3][sr]To save a future that had begun to crumble.

To be perfectly frank, the cause is Lily. You too, Nero.[sr]It's you ladies.

No, you ladies will do nothing. Well, the Red One's concert tour did bring Planet Rome to its ruins.

What!?
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠X
Yes. It was so bad even Altera ran away from it.[sr]But I am not here to speak on such trivial matters!
[k]

＠X
You Sabers will do nothing. However, your mere presence causes trouble for the future.

Get this. You may find it hard to believe, but in the future, there are many of you.
[k]

＠X
Actually, there are many of “us.” There are so many that the whole world could end up at war.

＠X
You bet I am! Why would I make up such a story to make myself look good!
[k]

＠X
The future is flooded with the Saber Class, and the inflation is out of control.
[k]

＠X
Due to that, the Class value has plummeted and the Servant-verse has fallen into an unprecedented economic crisis.
[k]

＠X
If it continues, the Lancer Class will be annihilated...
[k]

＠X
...and the Archer Class will all be rounded up as criminals and imprisoned.
[k]

＠X
Because of this, the free Servant-verse will lose all meaning. So I devoted myself to coming back here to the past.
[k]

＠X
Either I must destroy the Saber Class that will saturate us... Or eliminate whatever the cause is from history.

...Yes, that's right.[sr]I am a Saber that shouldn't even exist...

You could even call me one of the causes of the Saber Class saturation that you speak of, Ms. X.

N-No, Lily is all right.[sr]Destroying all the Sabers is not right.
[k]

＠X
I mean, if I don't leave at least one, then I myself will never be born.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠X
And the person that is most suited to that role is you, Lily!

Isn't it obvious?[sr]Your character is far too strong for it, and most of all...
[k]

＠X
Now that we're talking like this, you don't resemble me in the least.
[k]

＠X
...Anyway, though there are many things about you that I find inexcusable, I will forgive you for now[line 3]
