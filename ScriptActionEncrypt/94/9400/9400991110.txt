At the base, an ocean of vanilla ice cream. The middle layer also has vanilla ice cream to add more depth and flavor.
[k]

＠Altria
And on the top layer, the king of ice cream: vanilla.[sr]Hm. It's balanced perfectly.
[k]

＠Altria
And with the mound of vanilla as its center, I'll top it off with fruit, a chocolate cookie, a wafer, and blue mint sauce.

[charaFace A 9]
＠Altria
I'm done! It's completed! This is wonderful...! Something so perfect is sure to become a national treasure of Britain!

＠Altria
I'm compelled to try a bite...but I shall hold back. After all, it's Valentine's Day, and that only comes once a year!

？1：... (I don't know when to come out...)

(Gasp) [%1], you're already here!?
[k]

＠Altria
To not notice you even at close-range... My apologies, I was just so absorbed in what I was doing.
[k]

？1：I just got here.
？2：What were you making?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Altria
I was making your gift, of course.[sr]It's like a winner's trophy.
[k]

＠Altria
I wanted to show you my appreciation for all you have done. And with that in mind, I have prepared the ultimate treat.
[k]

Hmph. Where are your manners, Fou? I'm good with my hands, so any dish I've made once, I can make again.

＠Altria
Did you come here alone?[sr]Are there any other Servants around?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Altria
Then, please accept this! This is an original dish from “Restaurant of the Beachy King”...

Yes! This is the dish that I enjoyed after winning the Water Blitz contest. This is the greatest treat I know of!

＠Altria
While I was eating this, I thought that it would be more delicious if I had you to share it with.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Altria
...So I wanted that dream of mine to come true.
[k]

＠Altria
See, I tried my best. It was so good that I don't even recall how many times I shot with Viviane.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]
＠Altria
Yes. Consider that a perk of the job! Now, please start from the front, while I start from the back.
[k]

＠Altria
Once we finish eating, let's change into our swimsuits and go on a marathon swim! Let's have great fun today, Master!
