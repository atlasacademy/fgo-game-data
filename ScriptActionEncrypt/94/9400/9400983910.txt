＠Jaguar Warrior
I've finally CATched up to you! You know why![sr]Today's Valentine's Day.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Which means...hee hee.[sr]Well, I don't have to say anything else, do I?
[k]

？1：If you're talking about Valentine's...
？2：It must be about chocolates.

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Yep, yep! I knew Master would know![sr]So, here.
[k]

？1：Oh?
？2：Your paws are empty...

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Of course. This Jaguar's still a deity.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Which means! This Jaguar doesn't give, she receives! Giving chocolates and whatnot would empty out my wallet, and that's just a-paw-ling.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
I am beholden to no such human obligation![sr]Hooray, Jaguar! Long live Tezcatlipoca!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Jaguar Warrior
I should be the one who gets revered! Hee hee! I'll forgive you. Give me offerings! Sacrifices! Really, anything will do!
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Come on. Gimme! Bury your favorite Jaguar in an avalanche of PAWsome gifts! Let me drown in a pool of goodies!
[k]

？1：So that's it!
？2：I don't think the game allows that...

Hm? Something wrong?

＠Jaguar Warrior
Oh? Ohohahehue?[sr]Did you forget my present, Master?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Divine punishment? Should I smite you?[sr]Should I pluck off young Master's fragile petals?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Oh, of course, by that I mean your life, obviously. Nothing more, nothing less.

Yep. You don't need to say no more.[sr]Your present is...Master! You, yourself! Right?
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Hmmm, I totally read the room on this. You want to put some spice into the dish that is our relationship. Spice!

＠Jaguar Warrior
But even an angry god might have second thoughts. Want to redeem your Tig...your Jaguar Stamps?
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
If you redeem them...for a special exclusive offer just for today...I'll let you off the hook.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
And on top of that...you see... Um...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Right! If you redeem them now, you'll receive an exclusive gift! How about that!? Your life, or your stamps?
[k]

？1：Stamps!
？2：Life! No, actually...stamps!

？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Hee hee hee. I see. Then it can't be helped.
[k]

＠Jaguar Warrior
Behold! A special present from Jaguar to Master!

So here you go. You've redeemed one Jaguar Stamp. I've recorded it.

It's Valentine's Day. A day where handmade things are king. This could've been the oppawrtunity of a lifetime for me to score big points with Master.
