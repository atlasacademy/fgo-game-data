＠Robin
Being equally matched at hunting in the woods, we were supposed to take our contest to sea, so to speak.[sr]That's when[line 3]

That's when[line 3] A certain idiot stowed away on our[sr]boat and waited for his chance while the two of us were busy in the hold.
[k]

＠Emiya
And saying how he wanted to meet the ladies of the[sr]Southern Lands, steered our boat straight out to sea!

＠David
Now, you two. Weren't you ever taught that you must respect your elders?
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠David
By the way, I'd rather like to return to the shore now. What do you say?
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠David
What? The sail got broken and we ran out of our magical energy?
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠David
Then this is an emergency![sr]Quickly, you two! Jump into the water!
[k]

＠David
The boat can still hold my weight if I'm alone.[sr]The magical energy stored should hold out too! It's simple math!

Arrrghh! It's no use, I am about to snap[line 3]! Old man,[sr]how can you act so high and mighty at a time like this?

That's how every one of the Kings of Old behaves![sr]In fact, I can think of one who's like a walking mass of arrogance...

Oh yes, I'm sorry! That reminds me, do the two of you know the tale of Carneades?

＠David
When a ship sank upon a stormy sea, one man was[sr]fortunate and survived the wreck by clinging to a small piece of driftwood.
[k]

＠David
But there was another fortunate man who survived as[sr]well, and he swam toward the first man. Therein arose a problem.
[k]

＠David
The driftwood was large enough to keep one man afloat,[sr]but with two, it would certainly sink. Thus, the man[line 3]

For once, I agree with you, huntsman!

＠David
But I suppose if I were to knock you off the boat[sr]defending myself, none could blame me for it. So I shall join in your contest!
[k]

＠David
Despite my appearance, I was a King of many victories.[sr]I must warn you that I am skilled. Extremely skilled.

＠David
If there were a ranking of “Most-Victorious Kings” in the[sr]Servant World, I assure you, I would occupy its top spot.

The invincible Santa that descends upon Christmas like[sr]this storm! That is who I am.

＠Robin
Huh? Santa? Really?[sr]But wait! The sky? You came from the sky?
[k]

＠Robin
Meaning, you have some means of getting off this boat?
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Naturally, I do. Due to this storm, I have left my sleigh[sr]and reindeer waiting for me above the clouds.

[charaFace D 1]

A proper Servant must think upon their Master's safety.[sr]Isn't that so, Red Archer?

Come, warm this chilled body of mine as you did in the past. Come, hesitate not.

You are mistaken, King David.[sr]I am Santa Alter, not Abishag.
