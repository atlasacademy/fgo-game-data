Looking at the data, it seems they're made up of spiritual bodies on the inside.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They appear rough and crude, but in reality they could just be beings of higher spiritual existence.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I can't say all of the phantasmals in Japan are like this. Ushiwaka, what's your take?

You were raised by Tengu, right?

＠Ushiwakamaru
Mystical creatures from this land are not terribly different than those from the West. They are mostly categorized as spiritual beasts or spirits of the dead.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Spiritual beasts are physical existences hidden from the human world. The other is born into this world as a living curse without physical form.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
These oni are the latter.[sr]When I cut into them, there is no substance.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
They are like smoke that would kill you if inhaled.[sr]They are born of a curse created by human deeds.
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
So they're not a living creature of any proper ecosystem. Okay, then that makes sense.

But this is no time to be talking casually! [%1], put that pretty woman on camera!

Oh, shush [%1], you don't have to compliment me like that.

This time, I was only doing things for my own ends, and you only did what you did for yours[line 2]

As a result, our paths just happened to cross.

If fortune brings us together once more, then so be it.

Now then, I will be going.

But her aura is one that I seem to know from somewhere, her aroma... How can I put it... It's kind of nostalgic... Hmm?

But I also found a place similar to a human settlement.[sr]I only got a glimpse of it from far away though.

＠Dr. Roman
A settlement, huh? Obviously it would be inefficient to keep them working constantly. It's necessary to give the humans a place to live as well.

It's dangerous, but we might be able to get more information if we go there.
