＠Santa Alter
Good work with your reindeer training. You're fighting[sr]Christmas monsters when you have time, right?
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Thanks to your efforts, the fuel for my sleigh...[sr]The Santa Points have been building up nicely.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Now I can deliver the next present.[sr]Good work, [%1].
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Let's go over this one more time Christmas celebrates the birth of a certain person.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
It is the mass of Christ, hence the word Christmas.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
These days, Christmas Eve is December 24th,[sr]and the 25th itself is Christmas.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
But the original period was much longer. His birth was[sr]celebrated for days, reaching its peak on the 25th.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
In other words, beginning my advance this early[sr]is Santa's old way of doing it.
[k]

？1：You're doing it the classic way.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Santa Alter
Of course. Function follows form. Destroying everything[sr]thoroughly is the classic way to win.
[k]

？2：Advance? Like a military advance?

＠Santa Alter
...[sr]...
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Santa Alter
I see our destination. Give me your magical energy, Reindeer!
[k]

This “Dear Santa” letter is from Marie, a girl who lives in France.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Two of her friends are always fighting, so she wants a present to bring them together, it says.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Santa Alter
Humph. How stupid.[sr]Santa only grants one's own wishes.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
I have no presents to bring happiness to other people.[sr]What does this Marie think Christmas is about, anyway?
[k]

？1：Sounds like a mistake Marie would make.

＠Santa Alter
That's right. If she wants to bring them together,[sr]she should pick a present herself.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
She should do what I did. I once sent two knights who[sr]were fighting a single horse, and told them this...
[k]

＠Santa Alter
“This is for the one who thinks they're better than the other.” I knew this would test them and form a friendship.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
It worked perfectly. They stopped arguing in front of[sr]others. Although they were trying so hard not to snap at each other when they smiled, but oh well.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
That was Agravain's idea.[sr]Aggy always gave me the best advice.
[k]

？2：Sounds like a mistake you'd make.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Santa Alter
I'm not making any mistakes.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Santa brings gifts.[sr]She does not bring happiness.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Whether the gifts bring happiness depends on if the little ones have been good or not.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Santa Alter
...Hmm? This should be the insertion point...[sr]But it's a snowy field.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
The French Marie is without a doubt a member of the royal family.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
I was expecting her Christmas party to be nationwide[sr]chaos, with mountains of expensive turkeys...
