＠Altria
Yes! This is how a bath should be! Wonderful!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Altria
This is like the barrel bath you would take in an old mansion in Japan. It is very calming.

＠Martha
Yes, the confined space is just right. The walls and ceilings are built to last too. There's none of the indecency you find in a Roman bath.
[k]

＠Altria
Master told us to check how good this bathing facility is, but...
[k]

＠Altria
I feel a little guilty to be the first one to bathe.[sr]Maybe we should have let Master go first.
[k]

＠Martha
We're taking advantage of Master's generosity.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Martha
Well, if you are careful, two people can just fit in here.
[k]

＠Martha
You could have taken a bath with Master instead of me.

＠Altria
...

[charaFace G 5]
＠Martha
Never mind! That was an indecent suggestion, wasn't it? It's that wicked Roman custom that caught up to me!
[k]

＠Martha
By the way, may I ask you something?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Altria
What is it?
[k]

＠Martha
You're the King of Britain, right?[sr]Why did you suggest a Japanese-style bath?
[k]

＠Altria
...Why indeed. I don't know myself, but somehow[line 2]
[k]

＠Altria
Bathing here gives me vague flashbacks from when I was a main heroine... Somehow... Maybe...
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Martha
What?
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Altria
Like I said, I don't know.[sr]It's probably just a feeling.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Altria
It's like it struck me.[sr]It's like this bath and I were meant to be.

＠Martha
Now what? Why are you looking around?
[k]

＠Altria
I just had a bad feeling strike me.
[k]

＠Altria
It was like a vision of some other Servant bathing in this kind of bath, like she is the focal point...
[k]

＠Altria
Rider...Medusa.[sr]Perhaps it's a good thing she's not here!
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Martha
...I really don't get what you're talking about.
