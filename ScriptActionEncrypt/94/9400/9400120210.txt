Forward, my soldiers! Tear through the darkness![sr]Plunge into the blizzard! Wander! Wander!
[k]

？1：This sleigh really flies through the air!

[charaFace D 1]
＠Santa Alter
Naturally. One who would be Santa must be able to[sr]traverse the skies. We must deliver presents to the children around the world.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
I've dubbed this sleigh Llamrei Unit II.[sr]You may relax your guard and entrust yourself to it.
[k]

？2：Why are you yelling?!

＠Santa Alter
Insolent fool![sr]I am not yelling. I am singing!
[k]

＠Santa Alter
By announcing my presence this way, I can also avoid[sr]running into airplanes! It's common sense for a Santa!
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Santa Alter
Good. We are approaching our destination.[sr]Prepare yourself, [%1].
[k]

＠Santa Alter
The return address of this “Dear Santa” letter is in Persia. A request from Darius, aged 3.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
...Hmm. The writing is so black and smeared I can't read[sr]it at all. Well, I'm sure once I see his face, I'll know what present he'd like.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Let us go! We shall enter from this magnificent chimney!

Ahh... The iron lament that surpasses the vocal cords...[sr]Echoing from the depths of the hollow, the enamored yet hate-filled voice of a young girl's lingering affections as she “sings” of death...
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Phantom
Specifically, I should call it the raging moans of a girl[sr]who can no longer abide her hunger. Ahh, how unsightly yet adorable[line 3]!
[k]

＠Phantom
Though it's a far cry from my own taste, she conveys her feelings so well it truly pains me.
[k]

＠Phantom
A cry that would pierce Heaven itself. You who spews[sr]forth such hatred, I'd liken you to... Yes, a carp swimming up a waterfall.
[k]

＠Phantom
Actually, you are more like a carp banner. How auspicious. Ahh, how very auspicious indeed...[sr]And hateful, too!
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Phantom
Christine! Christine has gone so far from me! Why?[sr]Why does fate endeavor to tear us apart yet again?
[k]

＠Phantom
Couples! Christmas! Santa Claus! Whenever I hear[sr]that this is a night for loved ones, it makes me sick!
[k]

＠Phantom
Don't you agree, Sir Carp Banner? Why must we, upon such a night as this, be a company entirely of men?

...What a ferocious cry from the soul. It stirs the heart too[sr]greatly. Surely, that Servant is an actor of some renown.
[k]

？1： Yeah, that was quite an elegy.
？2： Ehh, it was certainly a self-indulgent soliloquy.

？！
＠Santa Alter
What a splendid performance. He probably has more[sr]passion in his pinky than that cursed Tristan...
[k]

＠Santa Alter
...But I can't imagine that either of them is Darius.[sr]Also, that object in the middle of the floor...

There's nothing here but that tree-like candle in the[sr]center of the room. Does that mean Darius isn't here?

That's fine, then. I should simply turn around and leave[sr]now, but I do pity these two.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Merlin has said that when a man is widowed, his suffering surpasses the pain of Death. As Santa, I can't just leave them be.

Let us go, [%1]![sr]We shall be like the Christmas Carol that saved Scrooge!
