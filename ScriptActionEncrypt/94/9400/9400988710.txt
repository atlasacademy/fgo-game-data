Hello, [%1].[sr]What a lovely day.
[k]

＠Amadeus
And to run into you in the hall on Valentine's Day... Hmm, is my assumption correct?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Amadeus
No need to be bashful. It's you and me! I don't mind you giving something to me even with people around!
[k]

＠Amadeus
I'm used to receiving gifts from fans.[sr]A chocolate or two is no surprise at all.
[k]

？1：If that's the case...
？2：...(Well that's irritating, but...) Here you go.

？！

Thank you, Master. Ah, I cannot carry all of this to my room. And so... (Tosses into mouth)

Hm. Mmmmmm.

...I made a mistake. This was not something I should have casually thrown into my mouth.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Amadeus
But... Yeah! It was unexpected, but a gift filled with such warm sentiment delights me!
[k]

＠Amadeus
And so, I have a very special return gift.[sr]How do you feel about this?

Yes, it's a toy piano. It's small, but you can still play it.
[k]

＠Amadeus
It's made well, and it's a nice decoration piece.[sr]But that is not my true purpose in giving this to you.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Whenever I visit your room, I can play for you anytime.
[k]

＠Amadeus
There aren't that many keys, but a man of my skill can compensate for that. If you wish to have sweet dreams, simply call upon me.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Amadeus
Just don't ask me to play any requiems.[sr]It might summon troublesome executioners.
