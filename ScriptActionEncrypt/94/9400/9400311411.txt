You have nothing going on, personally.[sr]You're a Servant without a Master.

＠El-Melloi
Of course, a Servant can only materialize in this world when there's a summoning and a contract.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
However, in his case, the contract wasn't made with a human. ...Isn't that right, envoy of the Counter Force?

＠El-Melloi
We're not part of this temporal axis, and thus have a bird's-eye view of the situation here.

＠El-Melloi
We know that the end of the Holy Grail War here in Fuyuki will lead to the end of the world.

...I wasn't going to say anything until the end, but there's nothing for it. I'm coming clean.

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
The ritual here at Fuyuki will succeed, unlike in the past and future, and it will lead to the activation of the Greater Grail.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
The reason all of this was observed by Sheba[line 3]was that this area had to be the cause of the Singularity.

I see! It wasn't just observed as an unstable dimension, but as the origin of the collapse that would become the Singularity!

＠Irisviel
You guys...know not only of the past, but also the future? From a different temporal axis?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
That is correct. I witnessed the failure of the fourth war, investigated the fifth war, and prevented the sixth war from happening. That's who I am.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠El-Melloi
And I've assumed the role of pinpointing what makes this battle different from the others I've known.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
And the answer to that...is you, Irisviel. You are the vessel of the Holy Grail, and also a Master that controls a Servant.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
It was supposed to take another 10 years to complete. The Einzbern family's ultimate homunculus.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠Irisviel
Ten years? That's...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
It's a small difference, but this is a definite advantage.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
I mean, for the Einzbern family to find a way to win not via a makeshift guerilla warfare, but actual frontal assault...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Having a Master with the highest specs, commanding the strongest Servant, and access to the Lesser Grail.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Victory is certain for Einzbern. And this victory is plenty reason...for the Counter Force to activate.

...The Holy Grail War you know of didn't have any interference from the Counter Force?
[k]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠El-Melloi
That's right. It wasn't a factor during the third war. Meanwhile the chance of success was about fifty-fifty during the fourth and fifth war.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
At the very least, from the perspective of the World there was no real emergency to get involved.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠El-Melloi
During the fourth war, the Einzberns' research results were behind by one whole generation. When they finally completed their research during the fifth war, they made a mistake in their strategy.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠El-Melloi
To be honest, I'm surprised to see that this time the Einzberns managed to call checkmate on everyone.
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[communicationCharaLoop 98003003 1 5 0 5]
＠Dr. Roman
So to sum things up, this Singularity is basically...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...the embodiment of the “if” situation where the Einzberns are the superior contestant in this war.
[k]

[communicationCharaClear]
[wait communicationChara]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠El-Melloi
Yes, and the Holy Grail reading that Chaldea picked up was most likely Irisviel's magical circuits themselves...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Seeing how perfect the results of the Einzberns' research are this time, you can probably even call her a pseudo Holy Grail.

＠Irisviel
I'm not sure whether or not you're praising me or insulting me, but I'm going to need you to explain more.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Irisviel
What do you mean the world will end if the Fuyuki Holy Grail is completed?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Yes, allow me to tell you everything. Agent of the Counter Force, you should follow along, as well.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
I'll show you an even better way to accomplish the task you have been given.

Well, I can't say that it's entirely simpler, but let me ask you something instead, Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 1.5]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Would you do anything because it's the simpler way?[sr]Do you wish to kill Irisviel here, no matter what happens?

＠Assassin?
...I do not know. I have not thought of that. I had resigned myself to thinking there was no other choice. I did not have the luxury of options.
[k]

[charaFace H 3]
＠Assassin?
And now that you're telling me to choose... I am faced with a conflict within myself that is rather difficult to explain.
[k]

＠Assassin?
If you're telling me there is a different choice with this homunculus...then I think I would like to explore that as well.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]
＠Assassin?
I wonder why? I've never experienced this feeling before.

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠El-Melloi
That's because you still have a human heart left in you.

A foolish but noble soul, from before you became part of the machine known as the Counter Force.
