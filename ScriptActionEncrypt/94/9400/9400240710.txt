＠F：???
...The man was saved, in the end.
[k]

＠F：???
When he finally achieved his bloody revenge, he abandoned all the evil he'd built up.
[k]

＠F：???
He regained once more the nobility he thought he'd lost.
[k]

＠F：???
His emotions. His love[line 3] His human goodness.
[k]

＠F：???
The man's name... His name, after he threw away the name of Count of Monte Cristo...
[k]

＠F：???
He became Edmond Dantès. The man who regained love, even after becoming a terrible avenger.
[k]

＠F：???
As he threw aside his revenge and set out on a journey, they say you could see a foreign princess at his side.
[k]

＠F：???
But...[sr]But now he is...

...Where is the woman?

＠B：Avenger
Hmmph. Don't look so confused.[sr]The woman. The one I called Mercédès.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Where'd she go while I was gone?[sr]There's no place to go in the Château d'If.
[k]

？1：Huh? She disappeared...

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
You've no idea then, I guess.
[k]

？2：The Hall of Judgment, maybe?

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
Yes, that's the only part of this hell that you know.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
But the prison tower you've seen is only a small part of the whole that is the Château d'If.

You have all you need, but there are many other wonderful rooms inside it.

Let's go. Get ready. The last Hall of Judgment has been prepared.

Kill the seventh Lord. Do not hesitate. Do not be uncertain. There is only one path, anyways.

Hah! You're right about that![sr]You're right about that indeed.
[k]

？2：How do you know so much about this place?

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
Because of what I am. This is different in several ways from the real Château d'If...
[k]

＠B：Avenger
...and in many ways its closer to what I am.[sr]Neverending grudge has altered its very essence.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger

Let me tell you an old story.[sr]It'll help pass the time.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
...I'd love a smoke, but I suppose I'll do without.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
It's a simple old story. But some say it's the greatest tale of revenge the world has ever known.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
There once was a fool who lived by the sea.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
He was an honest man.[sr]He didn't know that the world was full of evil.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
That was how the man fell into a trap.[sr]He was falsely convicted and sent to the Château d'If...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
He spent fourteen years in that hell,[sr]and when he escaped alive[line 3]he became an avenger.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
He threw aside all that was good in man,[sr]and attained the cunning and power of a devil.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
In his wrath, the man put all he had into his revenge.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
One by one he terrified and slew all those who had sent him to that hell.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
Heh...[sr]Oh, I can still remember their faces!
[k]

＠B：Avenger
The shock when I told them my name! The despair when the evil deeds they'd forgotten came back to haunt them!
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠B：Avenger
Haha[line 3]Hahahahahahaha![sr]That was true vengeance! Righteous revenge!
[k]

？1：Is that...
？2：Was that man you, Avenger?

？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
Hmmph. Don't be in such a hurry.[sr]Let your elders finish their stories.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
But that's most of what I have to say.[sr]The man achieved his revenge, but let the last one go.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
...Some say he abandoned his wickedness.[sr]They say at the very end, he regained his goodness.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
[line 3]That he gained love.
[k]

？1：...Why are you so mad?

？！

＠B：Avenger
...The man did indeed stop seeking revenge.[sr]He probably did regain the love he lost.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
He disappeared, along with the captive princess who had loved him.
[k]

？1：A happy ending.

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
Yes, it was.
[k]

？2：I've heard that story somewhere...

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
...I'm sure you have. A wicked author wrote it all down, and it became known throughout the world.
[k]

？！

＠B：Avenger
The man's life became a story.[sr]Or perhaps the story was his life.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
Whichever way it was[line 3]
[k]

＠B：Avenger
The story received unparalleled acclaim, and countless emotions turned it into a myth of revenge.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
Once the man cried out for the god of vengeance, but sadly, in the end, became that god himself.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
The man's place was carved into history, in the vengeful form that existed in man's imagination.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
His soul became a Heroic Spirit, and when the King of Mages tried to incinerate time itself[line 3]
