The beach really does make things feel more exciting! Not having my staff [se ad163]does make me a little uneasy, though! (Fwoosh fwoosh)

＠Fionn
Don't you think so, Diarmuid?[sr]By the way, which one is your type?
[k]

＠Fionn
I hope you don't like the same one I do. Like what happened with Gráinne. Or what happened with Gráinne.

Um, well... that's kind of a hard question to answer...[sr]I couldn't say, really...

Also, I don't know why you had to say that twice.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Fionn
Hahah! Don't worry. It was just a joke.
[k]

＠Fionn
The thing with Gráinne was just something the people around me set up. To be honest, I was surprised too.
[k]

＠Fionn
But this time, conditions are the same for both of us.[sr]It's a fair fight, I guess you could say.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Fionn
No, that's not right. It's not fair.[sr]You've got that Love Spot!

You're going to show it off by winking at all of them, aren't you?

Don't worry about it.[sr]Diarmuid's basically wearing a swimsuit already.

Even if the girls' outfits have changed, our position hasn't. You just focus on the girls.

She didn't need to change too...[sr]That combat outfit was water-resistant anyway.

That settles it. I'm staying as far away from her as possible. I'm not getting close. Forget about the beach.

...Yes. But I think the basic plan is just as Scáthach said.
[k]

＠Mash
Our goal needs to be to get resources to escape.[sr]And to survive until we do.
[k]

＠Mash
For that to happen, I think we're going to need to build some new facilities.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
At first, it's going to be hard, I think[line 3][sr]But I'll support you with everything I have.
[k]

＠Mash
I'll help you make the escape ship, and I'll help you make our life here better.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Let's search this island and gather materials and supplies!
