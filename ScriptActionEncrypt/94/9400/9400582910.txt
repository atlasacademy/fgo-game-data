Our defenses are perfect now. The bridge is an important landmark. We should guard it properly.

？1：Do you have any bitter memories associated with this?
？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Altria
Sure, many of them.[sr]There were plenty of enemies during my time.

The Picts and Saxons attacking, bandits and insurgent troops going berserk during times of chaos...

＠Altria
There were countless times when we had to destroy our own bridge with tears in our eyes. After repelling the enemy, the futility of rebuilding it...

[charaFace B 0]
＠Altria
But with a drawbridge, we have no need to worry about such a thing.
[k]

＠Altria
There's not a single scratch on it since it's brand-new. How beautiful...

What are you talking about, Master?[sr]This is not a family argument.

All I am trying to do is punish the driftwood-like thing that damaged our brand-new bridge.
