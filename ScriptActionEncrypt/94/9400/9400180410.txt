＠Paracelsus
Ah, how can this be? It's sad, but all of this is part of my plan[line 3]
[k]

？1：I knew that.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Paracelsus
As expected of my Master...[sr]I am impressed that you noticed.
[k]

？2：Ah, yes.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Paracelsus
As expected of my Master... That calmness is fit for someone who will save the world.

We're here... Lord Caesar incites people with his words,[sr]Lord Hohenheim changes people with his attitude.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Please be careful, Master.[sr]Mages are like an author's deadline.

＠Shakespeare
If you believe without thinking, you will pay for it later.

[charaFace A 2]
＠Shakespeare
A deadline of Friday EOD means it's okay by Monday morning. Depending on the situation, you can even turn it in by Monday night!
[k]

？1：I see, you can't trust him!
？2：Aren't you embarrassed for saying that?

[line 2]Wait, wait a minute.[sr]Please listen to me first.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
What is chocolate anyway, Master?[sr]That's right, it's a snack made from cocoa beans.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
With its abundant sugar, chocolate is sweet and the calories and fat are also overpowering.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Paracelsus
...Currently, there are countless female Servants in Chaldea.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
They give away chocolates, and if Master eats all of them, it wouldn't be good for Master's health.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Paracelsus
However, simply destroying the chocolates won't do[line 2][sr]They will simply make more on the spot.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Paracelsus
Besides, if I do that, they'll kill me.
[k]

？1：I know right...
？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Paracelsus
However, Holy Chocolate War, where people fight over chocolates... I can't let that happen either.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
The world must be forever peaceful and serene.[sr]That's when I finally came up with my idea.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Paracelsus
That's right, all I need to do is to eliminate chocolate as an ingredient.

Indeed![sr]How exceedingly logical of you!
[k]

？1：This is a little bit extreme, right?
？2：Isn't this way of thinking a bit dangerous?

＠Paracelsus
A mage like me even agonizes over the question if I should use spells like the ones you see in fairytales.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Paracelsus
...Well, I thought it would be good to fulfill a girl's wish in the process.
[k]

？1：A girl?

[charaFace B 0]
＠Paracelsus
Sorry, I talk too much.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
Therefore, I don't regret anything.[sr]I'll do the same thing over and over again.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

？2：Whose wish did you grant?

[charaFace B 5]
＠Paracelsus
I cannot reveal that.[sr]Revealing a girl's secret is the act of an evil man.

？！

＠Paracelsus
[line 2]Now, I think we have reached a mutual understanding... That our opinions will reach an agreement.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
So there is only one thing to do.[sr]With this magical sword of Paracelsus[line 2]

I will persuade (brainwash) you.
[k]

？1：Did you just say brainwash?

[charaFace B 4]
＠Paracelsus
That's sad... I think you might've misheard.
[k]

？2：What was that in the parentheses?

[charaFace B 5]
＠Paracelsus
Are you saying that's my true intention?[sr]I wonder what you mean by that?
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Paracelsus
In any case, cooking is just mixing ingredients.[sr]If it's mixing stuff, nothing beats alchemy.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Paracelsus
I have my own opinion regarding chocolate making.[sr]I will prove the justice in my plan through this fight!
