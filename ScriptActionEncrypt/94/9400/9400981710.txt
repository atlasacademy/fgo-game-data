Haha. I appreciate it, Master.[sr][&Receiving a gift from a man isn't too shabby.:A gift from a woman always excites me!]
[k]

＠Fionn
Did you think I would just give my eloquent thanks and slink off?
[k]


＠Fionn
As a man well-versed in love, I know very well what kind of day today is!

[charaFace A 0]
＠Fionn
This graceful body... This handsome face of mine cannot simply be oblivious on a day like this.
[k]

＠Fionn
Valentine's Day. It can be a day where one simply receives gifts, but it can also be a day for those friendly with each other to exchange gifts.
[k]

＠Fionn
There are multiple origin stories, but...[sr]Hm. It's a tasteful event.
[k]

＠Fionn
This pleases me greatly! I like it so much, I have prepared gifts of my own!
[k]

＠Fionn
It is...

＠Fionn
Yes, indeed it is! Salmon![sr]Remember, this fish is not for...salmon else.
[k]

＠Fionn
Nobody could stop me from gifting this... Take a look! Look at how wildly it splashes! How lively it is!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Fionn
Hm? There's no need to stand on guard. Come now.[sr]It's salmon.
[k]

＠Fionn
Yes... It's just salmon.
[k]

？1：Eh? Really?
？2：You don't gain infinite wisdom or anything...?

？！

＠Fionn
Of course not. Nothing will happen even if you lick its fat. But you might get smarter.
[k]

？1：DHA...

？！

＠Fionn
Yes. DHA. Docosahexaenoic acid.[sr]An n-3 type polyunsaturated fatty acid.
[k]

＠Fionn
It supports and improves brain and visual function. Understand?
[k]

＠Fionn
Well, farewell. Farewell, Master.[sr]I am a man with a lot of salmon to give to many ladies.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Fionn
To the female Chaldea staff who took one look at me... To those who have fallen in love with me...
[k]

＠Fionn
I must give each of them a fish, as a form of atonement. Oh, life as a considerate, good-looking man is so tough!
