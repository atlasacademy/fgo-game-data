Hmm... This place has a nostalgic feel to it, somehow. Soothing, you might say...

If we fill it with broken junk like a storage shed, it would definitely be even more soothing. Yes.

We've just about seen everything now.[sr]So finally, will you come this way with me, Master?

This is your room, Master. Since it's a very important place, I thought you should take a test nap.
