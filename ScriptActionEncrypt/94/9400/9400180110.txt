[line 2]Sweet, melting, and bitter.[sr][line 2]I guess chocolate is the flavor of love.

Today is Valentine's Day, Master.[sr]Kiyohime, unworthy me, has made chocolate.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Kiyohime
To be precise, I “became” chocolate rather than made it.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Kiyohime
If I can become a dragon by holding on to my feelings for a thousand years, becoming a chocolate is rather simple.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Come![sr]I will be the personification of that cheesy tagline!
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Kiyohime
I will melt in your mouth[line 2][sr]but definitely not...in...your...hand☆
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Kiyohime
By the way, if I transform my entire body in chocolate,[sr]I would be roughly 240,000 calories♪
[k]

＠Kiyohime
You can cut me into pieces and eat me up later if you want to.

＠???
Well, well, I wonder what kind of nightmare you witnessed?
[k]

＠???
Perhaps something like “The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind?”
[k]

？1：Well, Ms. K...

＠???
Oh, I see.[sr]It is almost Valentine's Day.
[k]

？2：I can't remember...

＠???
A nightmare so terrible you couldn't even remember, I see.
[k]

＠???
But, if it's a nightmare that can even torture our Master,[sr]I have no doubt its content is related to Ms. K.

...That aside... Hello, my Master!

[charaFace A 2]
＠Shakespeare
I, Shakespeare, the most renowned literary writer in the world, have come to destroy your golden slumber!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Shakespeare
Why? You may ask.[sr]No reason, I am simply here to wake you up.
[k]

？1：From you? That's rare.

＠Shakespeare
I am sure you'd think that way. After all, Lady Mash is the usually the one to wake you up.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Shakespeare
Unfortunately, as you may be aware, she's battling with chocolate at the moment.
[k]

？2：Where's Mash?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Shakespeare
Well, well, have you forgotten, Master?
[k]

＠Shakespeare
All of the female Servants, including her, are spending all their time on chocolate.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Shakespeare
Some of them... Like Lady Artemis, for example, is making the chocolate for their true love.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Lady Mata Hari, Lady Antoinette, and Lady Boudica seem to be making chocolate for everybody.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
I guess you could call those types of chocolate, friendship chocolate.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Shakespeare
Also, although it's only my own speculation, I have an eerie feeling about what they might get in return on White Day, except Lady Boudica.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Shakespeare
I mean, the majority of male Servants probably never received a chocolate in their life, and glare at the world with eyes that look like the Tibetan Fox.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Well, there are also Servants who don't care much about this kind of occasion, but that's that.
[k]



＠Shakespeare
“It (Jealousy) is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on.”
[k]



＠Shakespeare
...That's the saying, no?
[k]

？1：Would they be happy to get one from me?
？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Shakespeare
Ohhh, Master's handmade chocolate![sr]That would make any Servant happy!
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Servants are emotional entities. If they get chocolate from you, you can expect them to work extra hard.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Shakespeare
In that case, let's go join the ladies and make some chocolate with them!

Well, well, Master! I shall be rooting for you, so please go finish this quickly!
