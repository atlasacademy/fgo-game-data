The demonic boar has been defeated. Let the others handle any leftover business. All right, Master. Shall we have a swim together?
[k]

？1：I... I think I'm too tired for a swim right now...
？！

＠Kiyohime
Oh, really?[sr]But there's no need to worry, Master.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
You see... In the end, while thinking of Anchin, I went to the bottom of the river.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
It was cold... and quiet...[sr]The water seemed to engulf my burning feelings for him.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
It was me, and Anchin within my heart...[sr]Just the two of us... at the bottom of the river.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Kiyohime
...But what if it had been the real Anchin there with me?[sr]I have often wished it were so.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Therefore, Master, being alone with you at the bottom of the river might not be so bad either.

＠Kiyohime
If you ever tire of your life... feel free to let me know, all right?
