I'm not opposed to the idea of having a barbecue, considering all the extra meat we got...
[k]

＠Mash
But still, that sign seems very unnecessary...

We were wondering where you went, but didn't think you'd be off hunting alone... So much for us running around.
[k]

？1：She did come back with a huge deer on her back.
？2：Yes, and now we have so much meat we can't even finish...

Oh, Master... I cannot believe I did not notice you were starving. Shame on me.

＠Kiyohime
The next time you cannot bear your hunger any longer, will you please let me know?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
I am prepared to give up this body anytime for you...[sr]I recommend my tail first.
[k]

？1：W-Well, there's still a lot of meat left right now!
？！

＠Kiyohime
That is quite true. Then, here, Master. Please have some deer meat that I slowly roasted with my fire.

“Rune fire” this, “my fire” that...[sr]Such unfamiliar terms flying around...

I guess starting a fire is a simple task for those two.

Well, they are indeed very talented individuals.

[charaFace F 5]
＠Kojirou
However, does the flavor actually differ depending on the fire used?
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Kojirou
I did try to compare them, but with my unsophisticated palate I could not tell.
[k]

？1：I agree...
？2：M-Maybe it's just the feel of it...?

Hahaha.[sr]This would be charred meat, not chargrilled meat.

I tried to add to the types of fires, but dear me.[sr]“More than enough is too much,” I suppose.

But, as a cooking method, barbecue is simply a bit too sloppy. Surely there's no denying that now?
