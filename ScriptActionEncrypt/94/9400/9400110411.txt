＠Artemis
Oh dear, oh dear...[sr]I feel like I've been very mean to you.

＠Artemis
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.[sr]Even though Darling didn't tell me to, I...

...It was only for one battle,[sr]but if I was of use to you, there is no greater joy.

Shield maiden, temporary Master.[sr]Someday, beyond the end of time, we may meet.

＠Diarmuid
Farewell.[sr]Scáthach... A million thanks for your compassion.

Scáthach said this was the last remnant.[sr]Which means we should be done?

Correct. You get a perfect score.[sr]Now, since that's done...
[k]

＠Scáthach
This is as far as I go. The overflowing remnants[sr]have been removed from your hearts.
[k]

＠Scáthach
So there's no need for me to force myself[sr]to stay in this realm.

＠Scáthach
Even if you die, you will never become remnants.[sr]So there's nothing to fear... Though I suppose it's cruel to say that.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Fear, tremble, and yet stand against[sr]a pride that would incinerate even death.
[k]

＠Scáthach
If nothing else,[sr]you've done it once.
[k]

＠Scáthach
So it should be just as easy to do it again, or three times,[sr]or a hundred. Do your jobs, and become the heroes who restored humanity.
[k]

？1：I can't do it a hundred times, Scáthach!
？2：YEAH!
