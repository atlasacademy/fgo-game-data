＠Jekyll
Of course. I cannot just be on the receiving end. This is just a small token of my gratitude. Please accept it.
[k]

＠Jekyll
Master and the rest of us Servants are able to fight all thanks to your hard work and support.

[charaTalk B]

＠B：Staff

？1：Jekyll, what did you get?

[charaTalk A]

＠Jekyll
Ah, Master. The girls on the staff gave me chocolates, it being a special day and all...
[k]

＠Jekyll
So I was just handing them something in return.
[k]

？2：Jekyll, what did you give them?

＠Jekyll
Ah, Master. Happy Valentine's Day... Is that correct?
[k]

＠Jekyll
Just some gifts for the people who've done so much for me. Admittedly, it's not much...
[k]

＠Jekyll
I also received chocolates from those girls.[sr]Isn't that wonderful?
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Jekyll
Oh, my. Perhaps I should have prepared Valentine's cards.
[k]

＠Jekyll
I should have included some words of appreciation with my gifts. They were special gifts to those dear to me, after all.
[k]

？1：Is there someone on the staff who you have...?
？2：Special feelings for...?

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Jekyll
Haha. Of course not! There is only one person who is special to me in a place like this.
[k]

＠Jekyll
That would be you, Master. The mage who holds to our contract, even when I am on the verge of breakdown.

...I am extremely unstable.[sr]I'm sure I'm quite a handful...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Jekyll
But despite that, you keep me as your Servant.[sr]Thank you. I am truly grateful to you.
[k]

＠Jekyll
You have given me a second chance. You have given me the greatest opportunity to fight the other self within me...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Jekyll
As long as you fight for good and right, I...and the other me can manage to get by.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Jekyll
I'm sorry for rambling about such bizarre things. Oh yes. I almost forgot to give this to you.

？2：Did you make these yourself, Jekyll?

？！

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Jekyll
Yes, they're rice balls. Miss Kiyohime and Mr. Emiya taught me how to make them.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Jekyll
I hope they turned out well. To be honest, I'm not too confident about the finished product.
[k]

＠Jekyll
I hope you find them delicious.[sr]If not...well, in that case...
[k]


[charaFace A 3]
＠Jekyll
...I will show you my gratitude in a different way.
