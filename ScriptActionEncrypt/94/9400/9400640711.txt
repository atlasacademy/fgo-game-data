Then I don't know anything about her.

I think you should just give up. Too bad.

You know what this world is?[sr]A merry party hall where magical girls gather.

My attack on Nursery Rhyme actually had an effect on her[line 2]albeit not completely.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Perhaps she and Queen Medb possess different traits, even though they're both magical girls?

...Or perhaps I myself have changed in some way?

Going by topography inside the Reality Marble that we've already identified, it's toward a group of islands situated in an ocean.

I'm guessing this is the “Land of Dragons and Sea” that Nursery Rhyme mentioned?
