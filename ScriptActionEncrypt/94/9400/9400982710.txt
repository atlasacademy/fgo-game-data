＠Shuten-Douji
...I was wondering why I couldn't find you. My, my.
[k]


＠Shuten-Douji
So this is where you've been hiding.[sr]Everyone in Chaldea is out looking for you.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
How does it feel to have so many fawning over you?[sr]Is such a thing annoying, in truth?
[k]

？1：They just dropped by my room.

＠Shuten-Douji
Oh, is that so?
[k]

？2：Why are you here, Shuten-Douji?

[charaFace A 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
Oh, I wonder. Hee hee.

？！



＠Shuten-Douji
By the way, Master.[sr]Have you seen a certain Minamoto walking around?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
If you do see her, you may be in more than a little danger. You should watch yourself.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Not that I'd ever wish to frighten you, but if you answer a question wrong... Well, you know how she is.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
Just watch your back. Tee hee. Oooh, how scary. One never knows what's going on in the head of someone who slays her own kind.

Whatever. Isn't today one of those days where you give and receive sweets?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
How exquisite. I like things like that.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I prepared a little something sweet myself, but I'm not sure if you will like it.

Tee hee. This is almost like giving candy to children.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
What a good child you are. Oh my, saying such a thing almost makes me sound like that cow.
[k]

？1：What about Kintoki?
？2：Did you give some to Kintoki already?

？！

[charaFace A 4]

Hm?

Oh? Why would you ask? Are you curious?

＠Shuten-Douji
I don't care about that brat.[sr]He's been running around and trying to hide all day.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Well, I DO plan to get him drunk, tie him up, and stuff his mouth with all sorts of...things at the end of the day.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
Oooh, what would happen if I just ate him up right after? Do you think he would taste nice and sweet?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Mmm, that sounds good.[sr]Maybe I'll try that.
[k]

？1：Uh, maybe not.
？2：Take it easy on him...okay?

？！

＠Shuten-Douji
Ah. Fufufu. I suppose.

Are you trying to...
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
...keep this oni all to yourself?[sr]Oooh. I never knew someone so possessive.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Or perhaps you want the brat to yourself?[sr]I wouldn't mind that either.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Seize the things you want.[sr]Eat whenever you want to eat.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
That is how oni live. I gave you this gift because it's what I felt like doing today.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Shuten-Douji
...I shouldn't stick around too long. Who knows?[sr]A moment from now, I may want to eat you aaall up.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Shuten-Douji
But if you say you don't mind, I could stay here with you forever and ever.

Well, see you later.[sr]Don't tease the oni too much.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
One day, I might really dissolve your flesh and bones...
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
And then savor you to the last drop.
