＠Shuten-Douji
I don't know who's behind this, but it's a disgrace to us if someone can build an island like this overnight.
[k]


＠Shuten-Douji
Ibaraki and I got really angry about it.[sr]We came here to sightsee, and crush the place.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
We can't be having this botched Onigashima, these oni, or humans hanging around. We came to this island to turn it upside down!
[k]

？1：Then why are you running a teahouse?
？！

[charaFace F 0]

＠Shuten-Douji
Fufufufu. If we're going to do it, we may as well have fun. Just coming in to smash and kill is so... unrefined.

＠Shuten-Douji
Especially when we're up against these ugly oni. We want to have fun and put an end to this with elegance.

That's right. So for our first step, Shuten and myself sneaked into the island's treasure room.
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Stealing treasures is what oni do. When it comes to lock picking and sneaking, I'm better than any oni around.
[k]

[charaTalk F]

＠Shuten-Douji
When we were in there, we found an interesting cup.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
To try it out, I poured some wine in and drank it, and it tasted familiar[line 3]
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I had a realization and understood how this all started. I knew it wouldn't be good for just us to go crushing this island.
[k]

[charaTalk G]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
That's right. After taking a drink she said[sr]“Why don't we wait for Kintoki to join us?” of all things.
[k]

[charaTalk F]
[charaFace F 4]

＠Shuten-Douji
Would you shut up, Ibaraki? Anyways, since we had some good wine, naturally we had to have a banquet.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
That's why we're out here serving wine.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I don't know what it's like further up, but now there's a spell on all the oni and humans from here on down.

But there are several things that bother me about what you said. You poured wine into a cup? It tasted familiar? Could it be[line 2]

＠Shuten-Douji
If it isn't the spineless Onmyouji.[sr]Fufu, yes, it's just as you predicted.

These two are oni. Just because they are the enemy of this island's oni, that doesn't make them our friends.

It's not a matter of whether we can trust them or not. Nothing good will come out of oni being together with humans.

...It's different when humans betray each other. Humans are like... you know... They reason things out before a betrayal.

Oni are different. They will betray you without any reasons. They slit your throat and take your treasure while you sleep. To them it's like breathing.

They'll even go as far as destroying something they consider dear if it suits them.
