So why were you in the tavern with that sign?

Oh, that? All I did was say this to the owner lady:

“Now then! I'm looking for some strong, radiant companions! Ones who will put me in the spotlight and worship me!”
[k]

＠Elisabeth
“I'll be on vocals. I've never been in a band before. Looking for pros on guitar, bass, and drums.”
