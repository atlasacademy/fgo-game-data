I do agree that our stronghold shouldn't stay the same when the island has been through so much expansion.

Naturally, we suggest building a Japanese-style samurai residence! With a big garden. And a storehouse.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Mmm... As a good wife and maiden fox that all of Japan is proud of, I'd recommend a mansion...

Do you remember when we were building our first house? My opinion still hasn't changed.

All that matters is protection. A big house?[sr]That means it'll have to be a big fortress!
