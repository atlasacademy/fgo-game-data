...Hmm?[sr]No, what is this?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's a Servant... But it looks a little crude.[sr]Like parts of it are patched together.

Crude?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A Shadow Servant is literally a fake[line 3]a shadow modeled after a Heroic Spirit's Spirit Origin.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This is just “something very similar.” It's a well-made Spirit Origin down to the details, but...
[k]

＠Emiya
Should we call it a counterfeit?
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Yes. That's exactly right.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

We are counterfeit Heroic Spirits. We're Servants, yet we are neither pure Servants nor pure heroes.

Yup. No need to bring that up.[sr]I don't worry about that kind of stuff at all.

＠Alexander
What's required from me now is innocence and purity. That's what will bring her peace.
[k]

＠Alexander
On the other hand, that also means all she wanted was my abilities, without any unnecessary elements.
[k]

＠Alexander
But I guess that's fun in its own way.
