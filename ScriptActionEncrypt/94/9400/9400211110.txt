＠Mary
Ahh. So you've finally come. I was getting tired of waiting.

＠Mary
Are you from Silver Saucer?[sr]Or Othello Pizza?
[k]

＠Mary
Well, either is fine. As always, leave the loot at the door and get out. I'll spare your life, at least.

The kitchen is stuffed full of empty food cartons... There are empty pizza boxes stacked up in a tower...

This is unmistakably the apartment of a rundown corporate worker! It's a weary corporate worker's apartment, Senpai!

...Oh? You're not the mail order delivery man, are you? Call him, will you?
[k]

＠Anne
Please hurry and deliver my Top 100 High-Seas Adventure Novels set. I'm so beyond bored. We just keep getting food deliveries.

[charaFace F 1]
＠Anne
Oh, and of course, you won't charge us for this, right? As you can see, we haven't got a penny to our name♪

Even you're living this slothful life, Anne?![sr]Listen, you two! Where has your pride as pirates gone?!

＠Mash
Where are the girls who smiled, saying that they didn't seek the Holy Grail for treasure, but for treasure maps?

Before we knew it, we had sunk down into this lifestyle! But it's all right, because we're pirates!
[k]

＠Anne & Mary
The deliveryman threatened us for payment with a musket, so we sliced up the invoice with our cutlasses!
[k]

＠Anne & Mary
That's the pirate way! That's our new pride as pirates!

＠Anne & Mary
Mash! Master![sr]You can't grow up to become like us, okay?!
