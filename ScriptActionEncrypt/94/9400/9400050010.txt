Good morning, Senpai. I know you just woke up, but an[sr]invitation has arrived for you.

Here you go. The envelope is traditional looking,[sr]and extremely formal.
[k]

＠Mash
There's no return address on it but clearly this is Senpai's name on the envelope.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
From the heading, it appears to be an invitation to a Halloween party.
[k]

？1：Halloween! Is it already that time?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Yes. It is, indeed, that russet-colored season now.[sr]In Japan, it's the time for viewing autumn foliage.
[k]

？2：What's Halloween?

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
You're not familiar with it?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
It was originally a year's end celebration in Celtic culture,[sr]but it changed over time to become All Hallow's Eve...
[k]

＠Mash
It's now a celebration put on the night before people offer up prayers to saints.
[k]

＠Mash
Though, I haven't actually experienced a Halloween celebration...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The bigger problem is the invitation itself, Senpai.

I happened to overhear your conversation.[sr]A Halloween celebration, you say?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Sounds fun! I love festive events like that! Back when the Director was with us, she would never approve such things...
[k]

？1：...That's [&kinda:a little] inappropriate, Doctor.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Oh... I guess it was. Sorry, that was my bad.[sr]I'll be more careful from now on.

I feel absolutely ashamed... The greatest flaw of a science otaku is the utter lack of delicacy.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I really need to spend more time paying my respects to the late Director. This time I will put more time and emotion into it...
[k]

？2：The Director is still alive.

[charaFace B 2]
＠Dr. Roman
Huh?! She's alive?![sr]Ah, I see. You mean she lives in our heart.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
After all, I feel the same way.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I never fail to clean the Director's Office, and I make daily offerings with her favorite dried fruit.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
You know what, I think that tonight, I'll put up some[sr]pumpkin decorations in the Director's Office.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Although, Olga Marie never admits when she likes something. She'll probably say something like,[sr]“What are these useless things?!”
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
...Okay, I need to stop. It's a celebration, and here I am dampening the mood with my talk.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Ahem! All right, let's turn this mood around[line 3]

[charaFace B 1]

But really, [%1]![sr]You're a smooth one, scoring an invitation like that!

＠Mash
The fact that she emphasizes singing three times[sr]seems unbearably sinister to me.
[k]

＠Mash
...Senpai, what shall we do?
[k]

？1： This “deluxing” is supposed to be “relaxing,” isn't it?

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
You're right. I wonder if she wrote it out of[sr]excitement or if she didn't know what she was saying.
[k]

？2：So this “torture” bit is...

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
She really means “torture.” To translate it accurately, it would be “Sweet, blood-covered, fairy tale-like, and torturous.”
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
There's no signature on the invitation, but... Based on[sr]the content of the note, I have a good idea who sent it.
[k]

＠Mash
A Servant who loves to sing... Loves to daydream...[sr]And also enjoys blood and torture. It could only be...
[k]

？1：Elisabeth...

？2：Bátho...

No, you must not utter another syllable. To speak her name is to summon her, [%1]!

＠Dr. Roman
Just as speaking the truth isn't always the best idea,[sr]spotting a disaster before it happens doesn't necessarily mean you can prevent it.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
So[line 3]precisely what are you trying to say, Doctor?

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Well... If you can't avoid a dangerous situation,[sr]it's easier to charge in without a second thought!
