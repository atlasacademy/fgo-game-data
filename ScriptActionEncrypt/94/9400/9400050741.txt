...Master, this wasn't quite what I expected, but we did manage to recover a fragment of the Grail.
[k]

＠Mash
If we take this back to Chaldea, we'll gain a valuable source of magical energy.
[k]

＠Mash
So all that's left to do is go home.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Or, wait. This is your room,[sr]so perhaps we don't even need to do that?

Oh, the question mark means you're not lying, right?[sr]We still have to be careful.

Please stay still, and rest your head, heart, and ears.

Yes, yes, you're right.

＠Elisabeth
You're never going to have a private concert[sr]like this again! Probably.

＠Elisabeth
...But I forgot how to get home.[sr]So can I stay with you, my [&Puppy:Deerlet]?
[k]

＠Elisabeth
You wouldn't leave a little lost dragon out in the rain, would you?
[k]

？1：Oh, fine...

[charaFace F 1]
＠Elisabeth
Really? Yes! It was worth asking![sr]Man, this new Master's a pushover!
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

What? Who am I to talk?[sr]Hey, I'm no pushover!
[k]

？2：Are you sure about this?

[charaFace F 2]
＠Elisabeth
I am sure![sr]I even gave up my prison castle for you!
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Elisabeth
Huh? Then it's okay?[sr]You're asking me if I'll stop being bad?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

Of course, I'll stop being bad![sr]...Wait, did I ever do anything bad?
