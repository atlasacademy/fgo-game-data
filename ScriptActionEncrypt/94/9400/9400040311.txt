＠Georgios
What have I done...[sr]What got into me?
[k]

＠Georgios
It must be the magical energy of the moon[sr]that compelled me to use Ascalon.
[k]

＠Georgios
Please realize, milady...[sr]The true enemy...is close at hand... (ka-thud)

...I never before fought out of greed, and now greed has dulled my blade...
[k]

＠Kojirou
In the moment greed took over, my defeat was assured...[sr]Bean paste buns are scary...

＠Kojirou
Oh, and I was strangely strong not because I'm on my[sr]home ground, but because of my class affinity? (ka-thud)

They haven't disappeared. They're just pretending[sr]to pass out because they're embarrassed.

＠Martha
Men can be so proud over the silliest things.[sr]Who cares if you lose a fight?

A brutal strike! DWAH!

＠Mash
It's true that men and women may have different views on fighting.
[k]

＠Mash
Statistical data shows that women engage in competition on a daily basis, and don't obsess over a single defeat.
[k]

＠Mash
They'd prefer to use the extra calories obsessing over more constructive things, I hear.
[k]

？1：Is that true for you, too?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
I...I don't know. I haven't fought enough to[sr]really find value in the outcome of a fight.
[k]

？2：[&I didn't want to know that...:Yeah, she's right.]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Yes, but this is just statistical data.[sr]It differs for each individual.

Oh! The sea parted, and a dragon came out...[sr]No, a turtle? An extremely tired-looking iron dragon?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Whatever it is, it's spinning up into the sky!
[k]

＠Mash
It looks just like an unidentified flying object, doesn't it, Senpai?
[k]

？1：Yeah, that's what everyone thought.

？2：She just made the morning papers.

＠Martha
Oh, but as a way of expressing our gratitude for the dumplings...
[k]

＠Martha
Yes, we did buy them off of a strange group[sr]in a glass carriage[line 3]
[k]

＠Martha
But later we ran into a fat man calling himself[sr]an emperor, and gave him the other half.
[k]

＠Martha
He was very skilled at persuasion...A professional debtor.[sr]The type who never pays back what he owes.
[k]

[se ad17]
＠Martha
Be careful![sr]You'll find him in the wasteland!

Looks like we've got more work to do.[sr]I don't mind, though. I'm having fun.
