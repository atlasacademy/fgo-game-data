Is that your manuscript?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Let me see... Yes, this one's mine.[sr]However, this one's a counterfeit.
[k]

＠Mash
This one is the real one, and that one over there is a fake... Master, I can't tell the difference at all...

The manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci stretch for thousands of pages, and that's just what exists now.

[charaFace C 4]
＠Emiya
It also uses mirror writing, which means making a counterfeit must've required a ton of effort.

I can understand the reason behind the Mona Lisa and the other paintings, but why the manuscripts?

If you take them back for me,[sr]I'll trade them for items in my workshop.
