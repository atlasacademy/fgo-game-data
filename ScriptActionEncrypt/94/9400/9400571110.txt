Now that we have settled in quite nicely, some of us are thinking it's time to create a garden.

Enriching the soul is certainly important.[sr]I'd say that's a good idea.

Master, I'd prefer a conventional garden. Like one that's absolutely unremarkable, one you can find anywhere.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
What an unusual thing for you to say, Kiyohime. I was expecting you to have an idea that would be very you.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Like arranging the garden stones to read “MASTER LOVE.” Or like requesting a totem pole with Master's face from top to bottom.

Speaking of stones and gardens in the garden, I heard there are Japanese rock gardens called “karesansui” in your country.
[k]

＠Scáthach
I know of them, but I've never seen one.[sr]So I'm pretty interested.

It's unusual for you to make a request, Scáthach.[sr]Hmm... Karesansui... Interesting...

＠Mash
Er, I mean, I wasn't stating my support...[sr]I was just giving you my opinion.

Wait, how about a maze garden?[sr]We'll plant trees and lop off branches neatly.

＠Marie
It'll appear the same no matter where you look.[sr]You can experience a very strange feeling there.

Hmm. That sounds interesting, too.[sr]Oh, no, this is also just my opinion.

Anyway, we leave the decision to you, Master. Pick a garden that you think will be a relaxing place for everyone.
