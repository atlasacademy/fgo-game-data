＠Santa Alter
So here we are. This time our “Dear Santa” letter is from Jean Kay, address unknown.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
I guess she makes a living as an assassin, so has no[sr]specific address. Right now she's hiding in those caves.
[k]

？1：Are you talking about Jing Ke?

[charaFace D 0]
＠Santa Alter
It's Jean Kay, I think. How am I supposed to know how[sr]to pronounce it, I don't speak Chinese.
[k]

？2：What did she ask for?

[charaFace D 4]
＠Santa Alter
The mental fortitude to remain calm in adversity,[sr]and a pair of easy-to-draw double daggers.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Santa Alter
By the way, [%1].[sr]Do you hear that strange sound?
[k]

＠Santa Alter
It's like someone's repeatedly hitting heavy meat with a[sr]blunt object, or endlessly pounding a bag filled with sand.
[k]

？1：...I've got a bad feeling about this.
？2：...I can guess who that is.

？！
[charaFace D 5]
＠Santa Alter
You're pretty perceptive. I wouldn't have guessed.[sr]...Well, once we go inside, we'll find out even if we don't want to.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
This time it's a cave, so there's no chimney here.[sr]We'll go in through that door in the front.

You've got that right, Martha. If someone wants to send[sr]presents, they can do it any time.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I went and got the enemy general's head for my brother[sr]the instant the idea came to me. He refused it for some reason, though.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Ushiwakamaru
...My Lord said something similar, actually.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I went hunting monsters, and they said they wanted a demon's heart, not their head. “Stop that, it's scary,” they said.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Hehe... Both them and my brother want so little.[sr]It's such a virtue to be so not-greedy.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I think they said something about needing eyeballs a while ago.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
If they want me to do it, I'll pull all the eyeballs[sr]off a Demon God pillar, but...
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Unfortunately, I've been given no such order.[sr]I wish they'd give me some kind of mission...
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
...so crazy that it could make you shiver just hearing about it...

Welcome to this distant cave, which normally no one should ever visit.

[charaFace E 3]
＠Martha
I can see you're two... Um, two travelers, right?[sr]Please, sit down.

I'll get dinner ready. Once you have some warm soup,[sr]please kindly get out, okay?

Add in an order of seared beef, too.[sr]Some sea turtle soup would also be great!

[charaFace G 8]
＠Jing Ke
Aww. C'mon, just make it! Pretty please![sr]I really like the meat dishes you make!
[k]

＠Jing Ke
Yukhoe? Is that what you call that stuff? Those thin[sr]slices of beef you eat raw. It's so good with wine!
[k]

＠Jing Ke
But how do you manage to grind the meat without a blade?

＠Santa Alter
Wha[line 3]t is this?
