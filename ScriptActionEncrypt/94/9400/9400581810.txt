＠Mary
What a marvelous cornfield![sr]Thank you, Master!
[k]

＠Anne
It looks like we'll be able to harvest a generous amount of corn, no?

Yes... By the way, you mentioned something earlier, but how are corn and pirates connected?

Right. Mash, Master.[sr]Where do you think is famous for its corn?
[k]

？1：The Andes?
？2：No clue...

＠Mash
Yes... I feel like America would surpass other countries in amount of corn produced.

？！


＠Mary
Right. Originally, corn was almost only found in the Americas.
[k]

＠Mary
But, at some point it spread to Europe, where we lived at the time.
[k]

＠Anne
One man brought it back to Europe from the American continent.
[k]

＠Mary
Yes. The man's name was Christopher Columbus.
[k]


？1：I've heard of him.
？2：He crossed the Atlantic, right?
？！

＠Mary
It wasn't just corn, either.
[k]

＠Mary
Because of him, all kinds of things started to spread throughout Europe that were not formerly there.

＠Mash
Yes, I have heard that his actions led to an unprecedented exchange of flora, fauna, and culture
[k]

＠Mash
between the Western and Eastern Hemispheres.[sr]They call this phenomenon the “Columbian Exchange.”

＠Mary
Oh, I didn't know there was a term for it.
[k]

＠Anne
Well, label it however you like.[sr]But if you think about it, it's pretty amazing, right?
[k]

＠Anne
Things that people never knew existed...
[k]

＠Anne
People from opposite parts of the world probably had no idea other things existed in other places.
[k]

＠Anne
Yet such unimaginable things began to spread into their culture one after the other until they were regarded as normal. What people took for granted was completely transformed.
[k]

＠Mary
So, here's my thinking.
[k]

＠Mary
Columbus's long voyage robbed both continents of their so-called “common knowledge.”
[k]

＠Mary
In that sense, that would make Columbus the great forefather of pirates like us.
[k]

＠Anne
So we're going to show our respect to our great founder with this cornfield.
[k]

＠Anne
Maybe someday we will be lucky enough to plunder some great treasure that will shock the whole world!
