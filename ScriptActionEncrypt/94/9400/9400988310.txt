Done with work. Looks like we got rid of the mountain bandits around here.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
But you're a curious one, Master.[sr]You didn't have to hang out with the likes of me.
[k]

？1：Good work today. Here you go.
？2：Take your day's nutrition!

？1：Huh...? Hello?

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Robin Hood
No, sorry. It was so unexpected, I just kind of froze.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Valentine's Day, was it? I do like holidays, so...[sr]Thank you!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Robin Hood
But now I have to give you something in return. Something that my whimsical Master would appreciate...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Hmmm, it may not be useful during battle, but it'll net you good pocket money for your travels if you sell it.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Robin Hood
Here. As your squire, I humbly offer you this, my Master.

？1：...A silver coin?

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Robin Hood
Yeah. It's a commemorative item that was made when some evil lord was overthrown. It was apparently made by crushing all of his silver.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
It was none of my business, but some village maiden insisted I take it.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
It was a commemoration of victory, however brief. That's why it could probably be used as some kind of talisman.
[k]

？2：What was up with that look?

Eh, nothing special. I was just remembering something. Caught me off-guard.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Well, something similar happened in the past.

Today's supposed to be a celebratory day. What's up with you calling on a wanderer like me on a day like this?
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Robin Hood
Wait a minute, we shouldn't be hanging around in this forest if it's Valentine's Day!
[k]

＠Robin Hood
We'd better get back to Chaldea.[sr]If it's a festival, we should enjoy it to the fullest.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
After all, a real connoisseur knows the best part of a festival is when you head back to your room to bask in the memories you made.
