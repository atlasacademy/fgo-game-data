At last, it's time, [%1].[sr]Tonight shall be our last and greatest work.

[charaFace D 5]
＠Santa Alter
The last “Dear Santa” letter is from an Alter, address unknown.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
An evil Servant, crawling in the abyss of a curse...[sr]In other words, like me.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Santa Alter
Her present request is for[sr]“A board game everyone can have fun playing together.”
[k]

＠Santa Alter
It's a game like the Japanese sugoroku, where you roll[sr]the dice to advance your piece, and buy up properties on a game board.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
The players buy land, charging tolls and usage fees[sr]to strip the other players of their fortunes and become rich.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
There are many ways to clear the game, but the most[sr]common is to reach a certain amount, or bankrupt all the other players.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Santa Alter
Below us is a Servant who would desire such a game.[sr]Exciting, isn't it?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Santa Alter
Let's go. Don't forget to smile.[sr]Don't forget to pray. Don't forget to be sadistic.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
As Evil Santa Claus,[sr]it's time for me to perform my last job!

[line 3]This is awful. This is the worst.[sr]The worst possible woman who could've come.
[k]

？1：Jeanne d'Arc Alter?

[charaFace E 3]
＠Jeanne Alter
I thought it was just that disgusting Servant,[sr]but you're here too, huh [%1]?

What does a pure-hearted Master want with a fallen woman like me?

[charaFace E 2]
＠Jeanne Alter
How?[sr]What part of all this is luxurious?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
The spirits did this on their own.[sr]It's not my taste. I would've used a burning stake motif.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Jeanne Alter
Or what? Will you be my straw doll[sr][%1]?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
A straw doll, crucified and burning.[sr]I like that. It's enticing.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
If you will, I'll forget about what happened before.[sr]It won't matter, because you'll be dead!

Heh[line 3]I was shocked when I saw the name on the[sr]envelope. A girl who's nothing but hatred towards what is good, making a wish?

The reason I started this was to fling this present[sr]in your face, but now this is my real job.
