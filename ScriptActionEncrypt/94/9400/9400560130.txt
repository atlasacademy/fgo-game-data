I don't want to badmouth you, my mentor.[sr]But try to read the room a little, would ya?

This ain't the Land of Shadows where violence rules, so try and adapt just a bit, kay?

We're by the sea, and it's summer. In a place where everyone lets themselves go, I can tell... You're getting really worked up, aren't you?

Hahaha, no need to keep it all inside. What do you say? Shall we go at it right now?

Worked up? Go at it!? Why you...! That's enough sexual harassment, thank you very much!

Alas, that's not what I was getting at. What I desire is the combination technique from you and Tarasque.

There are no other saints around.

＠Kojirou
I thought you would be able to show me your forbidden technique if there's no one around to mock you. Was I mistaken?

Oh, there you go again, techniques and battle once more...
