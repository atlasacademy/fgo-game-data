What are you babbling about![sr]My name is Gilles de Rais!

＠Gilles
I am “a sad father who was loved by his daughter when she was a kid, but is now hated by her since she became a rebellious teenager!”
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Gilles
I am Gilles de Rais, who gets shooed away with comments like “Dad, you smell like an old person!”
[k]

？1：How tragic...
？2：Oh... Yeah, I know where she's coming from though.
？！

Thank you, sweet young lady![sr]Oh,[charaFace D 0] if only my daughter had your kindness!

But so it goes. This is also fate... If this is the stage that child envisioned, I must resign myself to that fact.

Enough. Gilles de Rais, we have nothing to ask of you.

Finally, I have a question for you, Master.[sr]Why do you interfere with us!?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Gilles
If Leonardo da Vinci's counterfeits are a problem,[sr]we'll persuade that child to forge someone else's works.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Gilles
I beg you![sr]Please don't interfere with us!

？1：We have to meet her.

Right.[sr]Marshal Gilles de Rais.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We know her identity.[sr]We simply want to understand her motive.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Da Vinci
Well, it's possible that we already have a rough idea, but...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
To go into bouts of fury, despair, and contempt by merely imagining others' motives...
[k]

I can't give my approval.

Agreed.[sr]In any case, we cannot avoid a fight.
[k]

＠Emiya
Whatever her purpose is,[sr]it doesn't change the fact that she opposes us.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Emiya
No matter how touching her wish is,[sr]we must first defeat her if we are to reason with her.

...I see. In that case, we shall be your opponents.[sr]For that child's dreams and wishes.
[k]

＠Gilles
We seven Servants[sr]were created to fulfill them after all.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Gilles
Let the counterfeits surpass their originals![sr]Let falsity overpower truth!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Gilles
Even if we're branded as spurious, false, or specious,[sr]we still exist now, in this place!
