We built a place to live, and a place for water.[sr]I thought we were doing well, but...
[k]

＠Mash
This is the biggest mistake I've ever made.[sr]How could I have not noticed?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

...We're almost out of food.

Servants don't need to eat.[sr]If anything, food is like a mood stabilizer for us.
[k]

＠Martha
However, that's not the case for Master...[sr]This is a big problem. How did you guys get by so far?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
We've been eating the rations we brought from Chaldea, but they're about to run out as well.
[k]

？1：We tried to conserve them, but...
？2：I guess they had to run out eventually...
？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Martha
That just means... we'll have to procure food ourselves.
[k]

＠Martha
A lack of food is a serious issue. It doesn't just affect our Master, but it lowers our morale as well.

I thought Scáthach might be able to help, but I haven't seen her for a while...

[charaFace A 7]

So for now, we'll have to rely on ourselves.[sr]Let's see if we can find something to eat!

[charaFace B 4]

Hmm... all the plants are so different from the ones in Bethany. I'm not sure which ones are safe to eat...
[k]

＠Martha
But alas, it is best to remain calm in situations like this. Nothing will go wrong if we stick to our instincts.

？1：(I'm nervous...)

[charaFace B 5]
＠Martha
Humph. Master, why do you look so nervous?
[k]

？2：(I have a bad feeling about this...)

[charaFace B 5]
＠Martha
Humph. Master, why do you look like you have a bad feeling about this?
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Martha
There's no need to worry. I used to feed all kinds of weird things to my little brothers, and they were mostly fine.
[k]

＠Martha
In fact, they prayed even harder after they ate.[sr]They even had tears in their eyes when they did.
[k]

＠Martha
The look on all those tough little boys' faces reminded me of how He prayed over the suffering and sins of mankind.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Martha
So don't worry. And don't disobey me. My gut feeling is pretty good at times like this, you know?

They all look like coconuts... but upon closer inspection, one has thorns, one is fluorescent pink...
[k]

＠Mash
And one smells terrible... I'm getting kind of worried.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Martha
At the very least, I don't think you'll die instantly from eating them. Just spit it out if your tongue feels numb, got that?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Martha
Do the same if your stomach feels strange after you swallow.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Martha
If you're having trouble regurgitating it, let me know.[sr]I'll use a special method to, um, knock it right out of you.

This is... It's edible. I... guess.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Martha
What? Then it's fine, right?[sr]What's with that look on your face?
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
I guess the best way to describe the taste is...
[k]

？1：Spicy salted squid.
？2：Fermented soybeans.
？！


[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
It really doesn't taste like something... that you'd expect from a fruit...
[k]

＠Mash
I suppose you could eat it... if you forced yourself to.[sr]But that actually just makes it all the more disgusting.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Martha
But it IS edible, right?[sr]That means more choice in an emergency. Good.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Martha
I have to say, [%1], Mash,[sr]you're both too picky anyway.
[k]

＠Martha
People in the past ate things that tasted a lot worse, you know. Just be grateful to the Lord that your food tastes like anything at all.
