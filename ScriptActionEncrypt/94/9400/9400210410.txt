＠Dr. Roman
This sure is a strange-looking apartment... Its corridors are much longer than they appear to be.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...its elevator has a “Forever Out of Order” sign, and it's always empty.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's a sign that points to the stairs going up, but we'll never reach it.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Ryougi, was this building always like this? Or is it just this time?

Yeah. It was always a creepy apartment, but this time it's even worse.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
The width of the corridors, the number of rooms... Stuff like that doesn't really make a difference.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Ryougi Shiki
But this temperature... I can't deal with this cold. Now this really feels like a haunted house.

You mentioned this as a place that collects death. It doesn't collect ghosts?
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Indeed. It's more like it traps them here. It didn't collect them endlessly like this.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Now this place is like a whirlpool. It pulls in unrelated stuff and turns it into evil.
[k]

？1：...Evil?
？2：...Harmless ghosts becoming evil spirits?

＠Mephisto
I thought this place was like a magnetic field that attracted grudges like a lightning rod...
[k]

＠Mephisto
But a big tree's hollow trunk is more suitable. Once you take a peek, if you're unlucky, you will fall into the eternal abyss.
[k]

Hehe... A trap hole that opened in reality? Make sure you don't push me!

Ah, putting that aside, Miss Ryougi?[sr]I'm worried about that thing you have there.
[k]

＠Mephisto
Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, right? I heard they can cut down anything regardless of strength.
[k]

＠Mephisto
They sever the very activity of living. They bring instant death, yet it's different than brain death or heart attack.
[k]

＠Mephisto
I understand. I do understand...[sr]but they work on living things, right?
[k]

＠Mephisto
Yet you're killing zombies who are not living. How is that possible?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]

Doesn't matter if it's zombies or ghosts, they're moving... If they are moving, that means they are “living.”
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
If it's alive, no matter what, death will come. May it be oblivion or disintegration.

Welcome to the grudge garden.[sr]Nice to meet you. I've met you before, haven't I?

＠Jekyll
I'm Jekyll from Room 4.[sr]I'm the manager of this corridor, too.
[k]

＠Jekyll
You just arrived, so you haven't mutated, right? You're not ready to go upstairs.
[k]

＠Jekyll
It is better to stay on the first floor a little longer. It's a little cold, but you'll get used to it.

Do you want to rest a little in my room?[sr]It is a bit untidy right now, but you can use it.

I like to expose people's fetishes,[sr]but I don't like looking at them.

So, please, Master, decline Jekyll's invitation.[sr]He's not suitable as a Servant in the first place.

If you know it's dirty, clean it up![sr]Or perhaps...

Before I knew it, I was at Ogawa Heim.[sr]I was already a Servant.

But I wasn't satisfied.[sr]That much I know.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
The only reason I could remain motivated was because I had a hunch! That I might run into the real thing.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
The one who came before. The world famous mass murderer with dual personalities!

But what's this? Are you kidding me? Why did you transform? I thought we could enjoy some time together. I'm shocked.

Mr. Hyde, this is what she's saying. Don't show the ace up your sleeve too quickly. If you do that, it's basically saying, “This is my limit.”

It's more fun to watch a good human fight while suppressing his own demons, as we still don't know what will happen!

I serve under the Master because I want to witness that explosive moment!
