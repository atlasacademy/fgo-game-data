[seStop ad31]
[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Seems like it... We can perform a Rayshift[sr]to return to Chaldea from here, but...
[k]

？2：Think Roman's slacking?

[seStop ad31]
[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Huh?[sr]The doctor's being lazy, you think?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
I can assure you that is not the case.[sr]Dr. Roman isn't the type to slack off at his job.
[k]

？！

The more pressing concern is this woman.

[charaFace A 12]

Um... Excuse me. You're not a normal human, are you?[sr]Are you...a Servant?

They say that Orion was a fast-talking, no-good skirt-chaser who'd go after any woman he saw,[sr]but[line 3]

Hehehe. Sorry, I think that's my tummy rumbling.[sr]I haven't had anything to eat in so long.
[k]

＠Orion
Anyway, they say all kinds of mean things about Orion in the legend, but he's actually a pure-hearted, wonderful hunter!
[k]

＠Orion
And I've materialized to prove just that...[sr]Well? Do you believe me?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
She's appeared in order to repair her reputation...[sr]In other words, to correct an incorrect history!
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I know how you feel, Miss Orion.[sr]Your skills with a bow[line 3]
[k]

＠Mash
I'm really confused as to how you could[sr]hit a target effectively with that stance,
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
but that was really impressive![sr]You're as good as the Greek myths say!
[k]

＠Mash
The legendary hero who never misses, who seduced the Goddess Artemis!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

Oh my. Oh dear. Never misses, you say?[sr]Hehehehe.

？1：Your stomach again?

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
Aww, that's bad manners, Senpai.[sr]You shouldn't ask a girl about her tummy.
[k]

？2：Huh? Seduced a goddess?

[charaFace B 1]
＠Orion
Oh, that's true. More specifically, he made a goddess fall in love with him♡
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
By the way, Miss Orion.[sr]Have you seen anyone suspicious around here?
[k]

＠Mash
We're looking for someone who stole a large amount[sr]of provisions from our base...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Orion
Suspicious people... Maybe that trio I just saw?
[k]

＠Orion
They were running that way carrying something strange.
[k]

＠Orion
But, they were a little out of it.[sr]All the food was falling out all over the place.

Senpai! That's good information![sr]Let's hurry and follow them!

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
Oh, but we need to get those dumplings back...[sr]Especially those super rare dumplings. I have to defend them at any cost...
[k]

？1：Huh... Super rare... What?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Oh[line 3]that's right.[sr]You don't know about it.
[k]

＠Mash
Mixed with the other dumplings are some special ones,[sr]made by a famous Japanese shop named Nanayabashiya.
[k]

＠Mash
Their taste rivals a 10,000 yen sukiyaki,[sr]and their value rivals a dozen Saint Quartz...
[k]

＠Mash
They're special.[sr]I'm not sure what I'm saying anymore.
[k]

？2：Mash, calm down.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Oh... Right. Sorry. I panicked.[sr]It's definitely not that I'm hungry.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Anyway, they're very special dumplings. They're[sr]humanity's greatest treasure, and must be defended at all costs.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠Orion
I see! I understand.[sr]Can I help, then?
[k]

＠Orion
I owe you for saving me, and I need to showcase my[sr]archery skills, too. You're a Master, aren't you?
[k]

＠Orion
If you saw Orion being useful here,[sr]I'm sure you would want to contract with her, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
That would be great.[sr]Thanks for your help, Miss Orion.
[k]

？1：Yeah, let's get those dumplings.

？2：Let the hunt begin!

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Right! We'll pick up the rare dumplings as we chase after the thieves!
[k]

＠Mash
This is a special mission, unlike any we've done before,[sr]but let's do our best!
