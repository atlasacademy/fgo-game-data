Poor Musashi. How sad, Musashi.[sr]The desire to return home[line 3]

You cannot return anywhere.[sr]You are the same as the Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Oni
I'm sure you've realized it already.[sr]Your world disappeared a long time ago.
[k]

＠Oni
You were ejected from your vanishing world, and you are going up a creek without a paddle through the worlds of others.

＠Oni
You'll be an outcast, forever and ever.

There is no world left for you to belong to.

＠Oni
There are no doubt better swordsmen, greater masters than you.
[k]

＠Oni
But that is not what I mean by your greatest foe.
[k]

＠Oni
It's the path that you seek. To a swordsman, the greatest foe is one who has mastered the path, the Origin opposite to their own.
[k]

＠Oni
But...but, that will never be fulfilled.[sr]Such a person doesn't even exist.
[k]

＠Oni
The Swordsman of the Heavenly Eye. That path where zero rivals one is, in other words, infinity.
[k]

＠Oni
No swordsman has ever reached infinity.[sr]Such a path is something no one can ever reach.
[k]

＠Oni
Thus...your journey will never end.[sr]You are just like a drifting boat[line 3]
[k]

＠Oni
Oh... How I pity you, Musashi.[sr]How sad you are, Musashi.

All your talent will never pay off. Even with all your training, you will never get a chance to truly use it...

All right. Now that the pain in the neck is gone, it really is time to say goodbye.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Musashi
If nothing else, I can go back to the world I was in before I came here. Just like how you'll wake up in Chaldea.
[k]

＠Musashi
Oh, if you do make it safely back, immortalize me in a journal or something.

Well, we were companions for a while.[sr]A really, really short while, though...
