Where is this coming from?[sr]What's the point of siding with him?

Well, there isn't one, probably.

[charaFace E 3]
＠Waver
Then why? Just ignore him!

＠Iskandar
I'm not choosing who to side with.[sr]I'm choosing who to fight.

＠Iskandar
The King of Heroes was my main target, and he's gone. So I was deciding who to fight next.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Waver
Then you want to fight Saber next?

[charaFace F 5]

Nope. That gloomy-looking strategist with the furrowed brow. He's my enemy.

＠Iskandar
He's some kind of strange Servant, neither human nor Heroic Spirit. And his predictions are so accurate it's scary...
[k]

＠Iskandar
He clearly exists outside the rules of this battle.[sr]And yet he's obviously trying to intervene.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Iskandar
The one thing I can say for sure...is that he's here to interfere with the Holy Grail War.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Iskandar
I don't know what he's after, but I'm one of the Servants summoned for the battle.
[k]

＠Iskandar
Someone who's trying to destroy the battle itself is a far greater threat than a mere enemy, right?

Saber, Lancer, if you want to work with him, you're my enemy.

And thus, I'll side with Berserker. Very simple, right?

We've already defeated Caster and Archer, as well as most of the Assassins.

If we make an enemy out of both of them, then that's more than four...

Once Berserker has revived, we'll settle things then! Farewell!
