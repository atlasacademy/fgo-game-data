Fufu. Just what are you staring at, boy?[sr]Well, not that it's any bother to me to be stared at.

Fufu. What a mean human you are...
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Now, shall we begin? I've lost count of how many times we've clashed at this point.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
My signature weapon is lacking its best bits...[sr]Would you forgive me?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]



＠Shuten-Douji
If it were to clash head-on with that battle-axe of yours, it'd be such exquisite fun, such exquisite pleasure...
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I'm not fond of pointless battle, you see.[sr]I'll take you down with sensuality, not by brute force.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]


＠Shuten-Douji
But, well, we're only in this situation because it doesn't seem to work on you, right?
[k]


＠Shuten-Douji
Oh dear, oh dear. If I can't de-bone you with desire for me without lopping off your head, I'll lose self-confidence.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]



＠Shuten-Douji
But I suppose it's hopeless.[sr]After all... you like fighting way more, isn't that right?

Oni are evil. That's what you are to me, Shuten.

So you say. But I thought I saw you take pity on another oni before me and let her slip away?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Really, I'm quite furious now.[sr]De-boning you won't be enough to satisfy me.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Shuten-Douji
That's it! I'll rip out your bones and then use my metal rod to torment you. And with that, we'll erase all the history we've shared till now.

＠Sakata Kintoki
[line 6]Tch.[sr]Did I wake you? Sorry.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I let my guard down too. I dozed off and you saw a pathetic comedy from long ago.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
But yeah... I've crossed paths with Shuten a number of times.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
When we've fought for real, we always end in a draw. When we've sparred for fun or for a bet, we always end in a draw.
[k]



＠Sakata Kintoki
I guess we'd both got it in our heads that we'd found an opponent we were dead even with...
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Boss Raikou called me out on it, asked what I thought I was doing, striking up a rivalry with an oni.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Boss was the one who served Shuten drugged wine, which put all the oni to sleep.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
You know how the rest of the story goes. I snuck up behind Shuten as she slept and decapitated her.
[k]



＠Sakata Kintoki
And yet, that wretch...[sr]Even as she was dying, she gave me a little grin.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
“Guess I'll go a bit ahead of you, 'kay?” she murmured. Like she was enjoying her life to the very last.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sakata Kintoki
...Jeez. She really was quite a woman, actually.[sr]Even now, that never felt like a victory to me.
[k]

[wt 0.3]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
And, so... That's why I can't stomach the idea that she is being controlled by Ibaraki now.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I'll take on Ibaraki since she's an oni, but as a victim of Shuten's annoying antics, I can't ignore this.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Sakata Kintoki
At the end, I'm just venting my own anger![sr]You don't need to worry about it, Master.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
This fight is finally drawing to a close.[sr]It's time I gave her a proper thrashing!
