I can see something rolling in the swamp. Could it be some animal that was affected by the miasma?

That must be a mud bath. Something boars do to remove the dirt and parasites from their bodies.
[k]

＠Scáthach
That place is called a marshy field. Those conditions are said to be the etymology for the expression “writhe in agony” in the Far East.
[k]

？1：S-So knowledgeable!
？2：Tell me more! Ms. Scáthach!
？！

[charaFace E 5]
＠Scáthach
If the poisonous swamp created the marshy field for that thing... Wait, it's the opposite. It was that rolling around on the ground that created the swamp.
[k]

＠Scáthach
The puddle we ran into earlier was a mere coincidence.
[k]

＠Scáthach
This is the real thing. That monster will come back here again and again. I guess you can call this place its favorite bathtub.

In that case, the true culprit behind this land of poison, the one the boar piglets wanted to show us was...

However, I cannot overlook how you've ruined and eroded this island, since that is an act that violates our lives here.
