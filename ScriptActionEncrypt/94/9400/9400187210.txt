Greetings, Master. You seem to be busy running around but do you have some time to spare?
[k]

＠Martha
This is something I need to say since you have taken part in the event[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Martha
It's “Happy Valentine's Day.” This is a little something that I made by mixing chocolate and...
[k]

＠Martha
...grilled panis biscoctus. Well,[sr]I guess you would call it a biscuit nowadays, right?

＠Martha
Do you know about the origin of Valentine's Day?[sr]It originates from the martyrdom of Valentinus...
[k]

＠Martha
He would be happy to know that his incompete... Ahem, I mean his resolve of sacrificing himself became the day people find love.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Martha
Originally, though, it would be better to say it's derived from ancient Roman myths. Yes.
[k]

＠Martha
Should I praise Valentinus, skilled in special attacks,[sr]for the good result of keeping...
[k]

＠Martha
...the faith of his martyrdom to the old married Goddess?[sr]Anyway, it is wonderful to have more people starting to smile.
[k]

＠Martha
...Yes? What is this?[sr]What about my chocolate cookie?
[k]

＠Martha
A dumbbell?[sr]Huh. Is a dumbbell mixed in the cookie mountain?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Martha
No way, a dumbbell in a cookie.[sr]What's that, a devil's project!?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Martha
Well, if you make an ordinary cookie,[sr]I thought it would lose in impact versus other people's.
[k]

＠Martha
It was made in a very incredibly high density 1-ton chocolate dumbbells... It was mixed in with present wrappers...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Martha
...It's wonderfully mixed, isn't it?
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Martha
Oh, this again![sr]Rough work. It's all over the place as usual!
[k]

＠Martha
You know, it's tedious cooking for only one person!
[k]

＠Martha
Basically, I do the cooking for everyone in my family![sr]I don't specialize in small and neatly arranged food, got it!?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Martha
Ah... Sorry. What's going on with me... The confusion is making me vulgar. Tee-hee.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Martha
Yes, so I will do this over.
[k]

＠Martha
Chocolate is chocolate, no matter how hard it is. Rest assured that the taste won't change, [%1].
[k]

＠Martha
You can enjoy anything as long as you have guts, spirit, faith and effort♡
[k]

＠Martha
Please make sure you eat it all, okay?[sr]That is my request to you♡
