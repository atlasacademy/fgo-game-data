This guy's appearance is even more shocking.[sr]Especially surrounded by all that cute merchandise...

＠Chloe
Wait a minute. Wasn't Gilles de Rais a marshal who fought with Jeanne d'Arc?
[k]

＠Chloe
Why's he into magical girls? Shouldn't he be more into saints and witches and stuff?
[k]

＠Gilles
Magic isn't the only miracle. A girl who embodies the miracles of God is also in the category of magical girls.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Gilles
A magical girl who wields sufficiently advanced technology as if it were magic.
[k]

＠Gilles
A magical girl who took mere tricks and elevated them to the realm of real magic.

[charaFace E 2]
＠Gilles
Is there a problem with such enchanting magical girls existing? No, they must exist!

When young Jeanne heard the voice of God and turned it into strength for our soldiers, she was truly a magical girl calling forth a divine intervention!

Oh... young, naive Jeanne. How I long to see you again...

That's right. When I heard a sailor like Blackbeard was a Rider, I was a little confused,
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Chloe
But that means you could have a Rider who rides trains or rockets too, right?
