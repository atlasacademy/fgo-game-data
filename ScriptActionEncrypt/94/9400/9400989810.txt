Good morning, [%1].[sr]Will you be training this morning?
[k]

＠Gawain
Well, I have confirmed with the Command Room that you have no directives today.
[k]

＠Gawain
I thought you would be enjoying a leisurely day off.
[k]

？1：The excitement has just begun.
？2：A day off... In other words, a chocolate holiday!

Oh, my... This is for me? No, it's not that I wasn't expecting something like this...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gawain
Thank you very much.[sr]This is a pleasant surprise, [%1].
[k]

＠Gawain
Well, naturally I would like to jump up and down to express my excitement, but unfortunately that would be somewhat unbecoming.
[k]

＠Gawain
There are other Knights of the Round Table in Chaldea. If only they weren't around, I would twirl you around and give you a high-five.

＠Gawain
It certainly is not. An affectionate gesture must be returned in kind... That is the way of a gentleman.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Gawain
This simply will not do.
[k]

＠Gawain
If only [%1] was a knight, there would be plenty of things to give in return, but you are a mage.
[k]

＠Gawain
...Hm. No, wait. It's too early to get discouraged, Gawain. Just think of it as searching for something for Gareth's birthday... Hm.

Excuse me. Please wait a moment.

＠Gawain
Yes. I had purchased it for my sister, but I shall give it to you instead, Master [%1].
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Gawain
Just because one is male, it does not mean they never use cosmetics. Rather, think of them as arms and armor used on a daily basis.
[k]

＠Gawain
When someone you have your eyes set on appears, your battle begins there. By decorating your appearance, one's inner beauty is also enhanced.
[k]

＠Gawain
Well, these are for women, but nevermind that.
[k]

＠Gawain
Simply pick an item, and subtly yet boldly hand it to a woman you have your eyes on.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gawain
If all goes well, please report back to me. We shall both celebrate our victories, and talk all night of our lovers!
[k]

？1：Thank you. But...

？！

＠Gawain
Yes, but?
[k]

？1：That is absolutely none of your business!

？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Gawain
Wh-what!?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Gawain
...I see. So you too have mistaken me for a stiff.
[k]

＠Gawain
You can talk about love with Lancelot and Tristan, but not with me... This always happens...
[k]

＠Gawain
...Ah, how disheartening... I am also a member of the Knights of the Round Table...
[k]

＠Gawain
If I got word that you wanted to chat with me about a possible romance with a beautiful maiden, I would ride Gringolet like the wind to come to your side.
[k]

＠Gawain
Maybe I should have made a harp or something part of my Noble Phantasm...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gawain
Well, regardless, I would like Master to enjoy Valentine's Day.
[k]

＠Gawain
The victory of my contractor is my victory.[sr]I hope you have glorious military achievements!

I asked Da Vinci to get it for me.

＠Gawain
The interior temperature within Chaldea is set to optimal conditions, but take one step outside and you'll be enveloped by a blizzard at an altitude of 6,000 meters.
[k]

＠Gawain
I cannot imagine this is a good environment for women. That's why I would like you to use this.
[k]


＠Gawain
You may be the well-renowned Master now, but to me you are still a delicate lady ready to bloom.
[k]

＠Gawain
Like watering a flower, your heart must be properly tended to as well. You must never forget to adorn yourself.
[k]

＠Gawain
By doing so, you shall blossom into a grand flower.[sr]I have an eye for such things.
[k]

？1：Thank you. But...

？！

＠Gawain
Yes, but?
[k]

？1：That is absolutely none of your business!

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gawain
Hahahaha. Yes. I knew you would resent my statement.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Gawain
But please forgive me, [%1].
[k]

＠Gawain
The more of sound mind and body you are, the more powerful my sword becomes.
[k]

＠Gawain
Even if it be a temporary contract, I have sworn to be your knight. And so, I shall do everything in my power to protect you, my lord.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gawain
So, please resign and accept it. May we continue to have such a wonderful time together, Master.
