...Ah, and what a nice sky.[sr]All those stars, shining so bright...
[k]


？1：It really is beautiful.
？2：It's perfect, a sky full of stars.
？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes. I looked up at the sky in other Rayshift destinations, too, but...
[k]

＠Mash
I think this is the first time seeing so many stars without other light sources getting in the way.
[k]

＠Mash
...I feel a little strange.
[k]

＠Mash
Since I met you, Senpai, I've experienced many things I never thought I would experience...
[k]

＠Mash
...and seen many things I never thought I would see.
[k]

＠Mash
After all, until we met, Chaldea was all I ever knew.
[k]

＠Mash
Now, everything is new and colorful...

I'm sorry, Senpai.[sr]I... I don't know what I'm saying.
[k]

＠Mash
The stars are so beautiful, and silent, and I guess I spoke without thinking.
[k]

？1：I'm glad I get to spend time like this with you, Mash.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes, Senpai. I'm really glad, too.
[k]

＠Mash
It was an unexpected accident which brought us here. Honestly, there's no telling how things will pan out.
[k]

＠Mash
At this very moment, however, I feel very lucky to have seen this starry sky with you, Senpai.
