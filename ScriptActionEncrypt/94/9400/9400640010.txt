＠[FFE3B6]???
[FFE3B6]Hey, we can be friends forever and ever and ever and ever, right? Right?
[k]

＠[F4906D]???
[F4906D]...Idiot. Are you stupid?
[k]

＠[F4906D]???
[F4906D]You screamed, “I'm done with you!” at me yesterday. Did you already forget?
[k]

＠[FFE3B6]???
[FFE3B6]Um, I forgot. Besides, it's okay!
[k]

＠[FFE3B6]???
[FFE3B6]Magic. We have magic![sr][FFE3B6]We are magical girls after all!
[k]

＠[F4906D]???
[F4906D]Magical...girl? You call yourself that?[sr][F4906D]What's that? Don't you mean a witch?
[k]

＠[F4906D]???
[F4906D]Don't you think it's embarrassing to admit your own immaturity? That's just a failure. Besides...
[k]

＠[F4906D]???
[F4906D]I-I don't have any talent for magic...[sr][F4906D]I can read some spell tomes, but that's about it...
[k]

＠[FFE3B6]???
[FFE3B6]Hey, what are you talking about? That's plenty talented! I can never do what you do! I get stuck right away!
[k]

＠[F4906D]???
[F4906D]Don't write yourself off so quickly! You're such an idiot... Don't give up before you even start...
[k]

＠[F4906D]???
[F4906D]If you want to use magic properly, you should start by studying runes[line 3]
[k]

＠[FFE3B6]???
[FFE3B6]Study...? Oh, sorry, sorry. I'll try my best.
[k]

＠[F4906D]???
[F4906D]What am I to do with you...

Senpai. Senpai.[sr]Get a hold of yourself.

＠???
This is not the time to be sleeping. If you don't get up...[sr]I will (censored) you. Is that okay with you?
[k]

＠???
To do that, I must muster up all the courage in my body and put everything I have into it. There's no other way.
[k]

＠???
Is that really okay?[sr]I'm really going to (censored) you.
[k]

？1：That's scary. I should get up.

＠Mash
Good morning. A wonderful awakening, that's the Senpai I know.
[k]

＠Mash
From the way you sleep to the way you rise up like a submarine making an emergency ascent...
[k]

＠Mash
You have grown so much. I can't slack off anymore.
[k]

＠Mash
I guess I have to ask Kiyohime to teach me the Hot Fire Wake Up Time technique next time.
[k]

？2：Zzz... (Show me what you've got.)

＠???
Hm? You're actually awake, aren't you, Senpai?
[k]

＠???
When you sleep, your ears move back and forth like when Fou is dreaming, so I can tell.
[k]

＠???
...Senpai?
[k]

＠???
That was just a little joke. There is no point training your facial muscles now.
[k]

＠???
In some way, I respect you for putting efforts in such trivial matters... But right now I need you to focus that effort somewhere else.

It seems like another unexpected Rayshift.[sr]Although it seems like just... the two of us.
[k]

＠Mash
I've never seen such a place before.
[k]

？1：Wow... Sure is an unusual sight.
？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes. We've visited many different eras in world history, but this time I can't even tell if it's Earth or not...
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
This is like a different world. I feel uneasy.
[k]

？1：Let's take a look around.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I agree. Let's explore with caution.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Never mind the Servants.[sr]I'm concerned if Fou might have been involved.
[k]

？2：Let's contact Chaldea.

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
I already tried... But I am not getting any response...
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Do they realize that we've disappeared from Chaldea? Even so...
