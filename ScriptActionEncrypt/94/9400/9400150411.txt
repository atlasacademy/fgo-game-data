Hmm. If I am to be destroyed by something from the universe, then I am quite satisfied...

＠Babbage
Over 80% of moving parts damaged. I judge further operation to be impossible, so I will self-destruct.
[k]

＠Babbage
...However, a Servant that dreams...[sr]That has a nice ring to it. Truly...nostalgic.
[k]

＠Babbage
Whether they are insignificant bliss or overblown fantasies, dreams are a human privilege. That is what I learned in that city.
[k]

＠Babbage
However... You, lily-white knight, and you, Master...
[k]

＠Babbage
The obstruction to that dream isn't far at all. From the data that I have collected, I have elucidated her goal.
[k]

＠Babbage
Don't misjudge... Even if the actions are born from good intentions, there is no justice in those that come from the future.
[k]

＠Babbage
That spacecraft[line 3]is not a vehicle for[line 3]transporting dreams[line 3]

Kintoki, Nikola, and Babbage have all disappeared with this Singularity.

We were also able to retrieve the spacecraft part that they had acquired.

Could what Babbage have said...
[k]

？1：Yes, it's about X...
？2：Yeah, well, it's pretty obvious...

Well, I guess I have no choice. At this point, why don't I tell you the truth behind my real purpose?
