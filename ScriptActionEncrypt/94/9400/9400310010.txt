I'm sorry to ask you to come this early in the morning,[sr][%1].
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
It hasn't been long since what happened[sr]to Da Vinci, but we detected another Singularity.

I'm sorry for being late, Doctor! I've been having trouble waking up for the past few days[line 3]Oh.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Oh, you're here already, Senpai. As a master of REM sleep, I can see you are ready anytime.
[k]

？1：Waking up immediately is a special skill I have.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
I know. I noticed that when I first met you.
[k]

＠Mash
I still remember how cheerful you were when you woke up that day. That memory is one of my best to date.
[k]

？2：Actually, I pulled an all-nighter...

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
That is not good. Chaldea time is now the benchmark in this world.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Senpai, staying past 1 in the morning is bad for your body. Even if you get login bonuses at 4.
[k]

？！

Mash, I'm glad to see that you're doing great, too.[sr]Well, can I start briefing now?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Um...s-sure.[sr]Sorry, Doctor.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
You were talking about a new Singularity, right? But Doctor, aren't those coordinates the same as Singularity F?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
It does appear that way on Chaldeas' map, but the temporal axis is different.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This Singularity corresponds to the point 10 years earlier in time than the Singularity F you guys investigated before.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I can't conclude that this is a Holy Grail for certain, but an extremely similar response has been observed.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Earlier, huh? But is it really possible that a Holy Grail would manifest at the same point so frequently?
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Actually, even I can't explain that. So, I thought I would bring someone who seemed capable of doing it.

＠El-Melloi
Indeed, I am familiar with Fuyuki City in Japan...[sr]Or so I'd like to say.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
But unfortunately, my knowledge is estranged from the history recorded by Laplace here in Chaldea.

[charaFace B 3]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Dr. Roman
That's expected. Now that human history has been incinerated,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
many different possibilities got mixed in with Chaldeas' observation results.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Perhaps, Chaldeas didn't exist in the history where[sr]Mr. El-Melloi II came from.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Your world and our world... I am not sure which one is the proper history, however...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It is obvious that both worlds are “centered and extremely close to each other.” Otherwise, you wouldn't have been summoned.

[charaTalk D]

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠El-Melloi
You're talking about the cluster of parallel worlds in the Primary Branch... In other words, Phenomena Permissible for Revision that share the same future despite minor differences...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
And Phenomena Designated for Removal: the cluster of parallel worlds that would eventually lead to ruin like fallen leaves.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Unfortunately, that kind of topic is out of my purview.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
It's a part of the World that, unless you're one with a Heroic Spirit like me, is hard to understand.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Besides, it's not something [%1] must hear, either.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
So, I'm going to tell you only what I know. This is all just based on the events that occurred in my world, mind you.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
So. Your records indicate that the first Holy Grail War took place in Fuyuki City of 2004. However...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
As far as I know, the Holy Grail War has occured five times in Fuyuki City.

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 3]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Hm, I see. So depending on the situation, the Holy Grail War already happened five times already.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Dr. Roman
[line 3]Wait, five times already!?[sr]A ritual of that scale was performed five times!?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
How did they hide it from everybody!? Don't tell me the Holy Grail War is a competitive sport in your world,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
and people treat it like the Olympic Games!?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
A rather amusing idea, but that's not it, Doctor.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
In our case, the Mage's Association and the Holy Church colluded to cover everything up.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
O-Of course they did... Whew, that scared me.[sr]Please continue, Professor.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠El-Melloi
The temporal axis observed this time was not the 2004 where Singularity F was located, but 10 years earlier... The Fourth Holy Grail War.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
When it comes to my world, it's not a surprise that you could detect a Holy Grail in the past at those coordinates.
[k]

[charaFadeout B 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 7]
[charaFadein A 0.1 2]
＠Mash
The possibility that a Holy Grail could exist at that era in the past... Indeed, that would be able to give birth to a new Singularity.
[k]

＠Mash
Could this be a misadjustment on Sheba's part?[sr]I mean, to observe the light of civilization in the past...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
I personally hope that's the case.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Now that human history has been incinerated, it's impossible to observe light on a normal temporal axis.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
If a light is lit on Chaldeas in its current state, that can only be a Singularity that's removed from the temporal axis.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Am I right, Doctor?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
This is probably a stain that has already been disconnected from human history and will eventually contaminate it.
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 5]
[charaFadein B 0.1 2]
＠Dr. Roman
Exactly, Professor. No matter what this Singularity actually is, we must retrieve the Holy Grail that exists there.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠El-Melloi
I suppose so. Retrieving or destroying it is the mission given to [%1].
[k]

＠El-Melloi
...However, there is a problem.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
The main reason why the Holy Grail War was repeated five times in Fuyuki was because the Holy Grail never manifested itself, not even once.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Also, due to a certain accident, this ritual has been mutated to a state you can barely call it “ritual” anymore.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
In conclusion, you mustn't retrieve this Holy Grail. It is a Holy Grail that must not manifest... It's just a poison.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
While it tempted the participants as a “wish granting device,” in truth, it was merely a device of mass destruction created for the purpose to eliminating the world.
[k]

？1：You are really knowledgeable.

？！

＠El-Melloi
Of course, I did my research. Besides, it's my responsibility as a participant... No, I just want to reassure myself.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
I put in a considerate amount of effort to dismantle Fuyuki's Holy Grail.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
When it comes to the circumstances surrounding this land, I've left no stone unturned.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
How dependable. From the way you sounded, I guess I don't have to ask you to help us, right?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
Doctor, you sure are a bad guy. You called me here because you wanted me to help, no?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
I will join this investigation. I believe I am the best observer, don't you think so?
[k]

？1：You'll be a great help.

[charaFadeout B 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 1]
[charaFadein A 0.1 2]
＠Mash
Yes! It'll be very assuring to have all the information about our destination.
[k]

？2：You say that, but you really want to go, right?

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
I won't deny that. The Fourth Holy Grail War is a fateful event to me in no small way.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
And it's about to begin right now.[sr]I'd be lying if I said that I had no interest.
