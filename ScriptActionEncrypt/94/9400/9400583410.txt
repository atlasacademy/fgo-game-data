Fou is running around a lot, too.[sr]He seems to like it.

？1：So...how about we play some baseball?
？2：So...how about we play some soccer?

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I don't think we have enough people, Senpai.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
However, we do have this ball that Scáthach[sr]made for us.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Given the ball's size, I think it's just right for a game like futsal.

Sounds good. I shall give you a handicap. The teams will be me by myself against Master [%1], Mash, and Fou.

？1：3 on 1? That overconfidence will lead to your defeat!

[charaFace B 0]
＠Altria
Hahaha. Or will it?[sr]We won't know unless we try.
[k]


？2：Don't go too hard on us.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Altria
That is nonsense. One must always give their best in sports. It is all about both sides fighting to the death!

Those are some good moves...but not good enough, Mash! Now the only one left is Master!

Phew. You're good with the ball, Altria.[sr]Have you always liked futsal?

＠Altria
No, I must have practiced this somewhere before. Yes...though I don't remember much about it.
[k]

＠Mash
Those moves... With such a vague skill explanation...[sr]Very impressive.

Oh, that's just your standard kid hoping to make it into the major leagues someday.

Clearly, the child wants to practice alone in stoic silence.
