Humph. I guess that's all you can expect out of spirits.[sr]The only ones I can rely on are Gilles and the wyverns.

＠Jeanne Alter
So, what will you do? Keep playing?

＠Jeanne Alter
I spend my days doing nothing but cursing at the bottom of the Earth. I'll fight as much as you like.

Losing won't teach her anything.[sr]She'll just try and claim we never won.

My job is done.[sr]Good work, [%1].

I couldn't have finished this without you.

Chaldea's system has its flaws, so you'll have to start[sr]over from scratch. But that's all right.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Thanks to its flaws, and its vagueness, so many encounters are possible. It's a good thing.

Senpai is REM-REM-ing and looking very tired.
