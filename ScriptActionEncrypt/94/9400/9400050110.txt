We've arrived. The time period is unknown but the location appears to be somewhere in Europe.

That said... It feels both a bit frightening and yet fun, somehow. How odd.

There are jack-o'-lanterns hanging all over the place,[sr]and all the skeletons are dancing about.

It's a much grander setup than I imagined...[sr]Perhaps I underestimated her...

Yes... Since this is Miss Ba...ry we're talking about,[sr]I thought she'd be more of a paper decorations kind of girl...

Seems like we might need to pay extra attention here.

＠Dr. Roman
I'm picking up some weak hostile signatures here and[sr]there. There's no telling what could happen here.[sr]Be on your guard as you investigate.

Right, this was totally unexpected, so it's sure to be more than we bargained for!

Now, let's go, Master!

All that glitters isn't gold, but when in Rome, do as the Romans do, they say!

Hmmph! So a ghost-type is the first up,[sr]I see... How typical.
[k]

＠Mash
It's far from surprising, but well, I suppose it is what it is.[sr]It's the most basic of basics in a haunted house scenario.

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
On second thought, this could be fun.[sr]Senpai, quickly now! It's time for some ghost-busting!
