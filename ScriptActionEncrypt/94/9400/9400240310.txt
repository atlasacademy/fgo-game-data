＠Dr. Roman
All vitals look fine. I'm not seeing any issues with the magical circuit either.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Dr. Roman
But this certainly isn't normal.[sr][%1], can you hear me?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Dr. Roman
...No response.[sr]The eyes seem to be looking at us...
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Dr. Roman
...but the mind isn't here, and we're not getting any response from our answers. Even if the eyes are open, that's all that is.

I've been with you all the time these past three days... I should've realized something was wrong from the start.

I do see occasional magical circuit activity.[sr]That might be our hint.

＠Dr. Roman
Da Vinci and I will keep doing a detailed diagnosis and analysis.

＠Dr. Roman
Fergus seemed to know something, right?
[k]
[charaFace E 4]
But he wouldn't answer my questions.

[charaFace A 12]

Me neither. He said there was nothing we could do from here...

Senpai[line 3][sr]Wake up, Senpai!

How are you feeling?

＠C：Mercédès
Oh, please keep lying down.[sr]There's no need to force yourself out of bed.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
You seemed to be having a bad dream so I spoke to you. I apologize for scaring you.
[k]

？1：I was dreaming.

[charaFace C 0]
＠C：Mercédès
About your memories?[sr]You haven't lost yours like I lost mine.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
The reason you can be so courageous...[sr]Is probably because of your memories.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠C：Mercédès
I... I could never be like you.

[charaFace C 0]
＠C：Mercédès
That's where you belong, isn't it?[sr]Chaldea...
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
I've never heard that name.[sr]But it's important to you, isn't it?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠C：Mercédès
When you say the name, I can see the nobility in your eyes.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
I'm so...jealous.[sr]I'm sure you know what you must do in life.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠C：Mercédès
But I... I don't even know who I am.

How does it feel to have a woman care for you?[sr]It's not a bad thing, is it?
[k]

＠B：Avenger
You're probably the first to turn a woman into a maid at the Château d'If, Master.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
You do like to sleep, though.[sr]You were out for an entire day.
[k]

？1：Good morning.

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
There is no morning or night here. It is completely isolated from the outside world, so it's meaningless.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Hello, my temporary Master.[sr]I have a question for your addled head.
[k]

？2：Wait. Was I out that long?

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
The soul seeks rest of its own volition.[sr]You may not always be this way, but today you are.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
How does it feel to wake up, my temporary Master?[sr]I have a question for your addled head.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
[line 3]Have you ever been slothful?
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Have you ever known what you must do, but instead of exerting effort, given in to the temptation of rest?
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Have you ever acted, not as a gear in the machine of society, but as one who seeks only their own pleasure?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
Oh, there is no need to answer.[sr]That's what you're doing right now.

＠B：Avenger
Oh I'm sure. The connection between soul and body is becoming unstable.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
You're spending less and less time with your mind in Chaldea, correct?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
Do as you please. You can sleep here, or you can stand and face the third judgment.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
Whatever it is, you must choose.
[k]

？1：...I'll get up.

I am not going to slow my pace down. If you don't wish to be left behind, try your best to keep up.

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
Focus on the existence of your magic circuits. You are human. You can only gain power through reason.

＠B：Avenger
Weave the magical energy from your body at Chaldea like you've done so far, to fuel your spells.

Fight. Kill.[sr]Just as you've done on your way here.

...Haha. Did that anger you? Forgive me.[sr]These words and actions are the way of an Avenger!

＠B：Avenger
We gather malicious intent just by existing.[sr]You cannot escape hating us.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
You hate. Kill. Grind down. And then forget. Even though it is precisely that infinite cruelty which creates avengers of darkness.
[k]

？2：Was it okay to leave Mercédès?

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
Let her wait in the cell.[sr]The Hall of Judgment that awaits is yours alone.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
To be precise, yes, this is your Château d'If.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Your trapped soul forces fragments of the souls you've formed relationships with to come here, across time and space.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
Yes. You've forged a relationship with that woman.[sr]Or perhaps you will in the future.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
Don't think too much about it.[sr]Just keep killing the enemies you see.
