That's right. It's a pleasure to meet you.[sr]I am the First Lady. The first magical girl.

[charaFace E 1]
＠E：First Lady
Shall I introduce myself further? Perhaps in an amiable, courteous way, as befits a magical girl?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠E：First Lady
I was born in the Demon World, but raised in the human world.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠E：First Lady
I hid my identity and fought for people. But because of that, I lost my homeland and was forgotten by both humans and my brethren in the Demon World.
[k]

＠E：First Lady
Now no one knows who I am. There is no longer anyone around who will call my name.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠E：First Lady
But I didn't hate humans or my brethren. I definitely didn't sink to the level of becoming a witch.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠E：First Lady
Right now, my only desire is to keep making girls' wishes come true.
[k]

＠E：First Lady
I want to spread the magic of magical girls... of love and hope... throughout the world.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠E：First Lady
Those feelings attracted Echoes to this Reality Marble.
[k]


？1：Are you an Echo?

＠E：First Lady
Yes. Until Chloe came here, I suppose my existence was ephemeral like that.
[k]

＠E：First Lady
To form and sustain this Reality Marble, I needed to have an invisible presence.
[k]

＠E：First Lady
I gave the girls temporary bodies and magical energy to act as materials for them to create towns, castles, and kingdoms in this world.
[k]

＠E：First Lady
But it wasn't the same. To really make my wish come true, I needed a real magical girl. That's where Chloe came in.
[k]


？2：Why did you set the magical girls on each other?

[charaFace E 4]
＠E：First Lady
Ah... I regret that.
[k]

＠E：First Lady
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.[sr]It's too late now, though.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠E：First Lady
There's not enough space! This Reality Marble isn't big enough for all of us.
[k]

＠E：First Lady
That's why I won't let you interfere.[sr]We need another world!

＠E：First Lady
Yes Mash, that's why I reached out to you as well, an employee of Chaldea.
[k]

＠E：First Lady
With Miyu, I can do it. I can give all of the Echoes new incarnations.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠E：First Lady
And not inside this empty cage that is this Reality Marble, but in the real world.

Infinite parallel worlds host infinite crises. That's where you'll find real enemies who need to be defeated.

＠E：First Lady
I will allow no interference.[sr]Soon, I will absorb Miyu.

＠E：First Lady
Miyu is a stubborn one. And Chloe, who's already a part of me, resists assimilation even now. She is a truly disobedient girl.
