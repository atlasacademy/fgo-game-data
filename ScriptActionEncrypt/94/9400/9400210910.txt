...The Spiritron density's highest on this floor. Looks like we're at the center of this apartment.

＠Dr. Roman
We've defeated dozens of ghosts so far, but this response is far bigger than any of them.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The core that created this fake Singularity... The soul, or Spirit Origin if you will, of this area.

And it's close.[sr]Be careful, [%1].

Listen, the only thing I'm picking up is cold shivers. I can't detect magical energy like [%1].
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
It's more like intuition for me.[sr]That, and how much death there is.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Whether there's death, huh?
[k]

＠Mash
You haven't talked about it,[sr]but what does it feel like to see death?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Ryougi Shiki
It's creepy, basically. I told you before, what I see is a thing's lifespan.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
...Everything has a seam.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Those seams usually look like lines.[sr]Run a knife down them and that part will “die.”
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
If you have time, you can ask a mage you know for the more detailed theory.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
In my case, I happened to know this weird mage. She told me all kinds of stuff I didn't want to know.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
...Well, I'll probably never see her again. But maybe you have someone who knows her?

I don't know. Chaldea's got a lot of funds, but we're basically isolated in the mountains.

Say, why are you doing all of this? This isn't your problem at all.
[k]

＠Evil Mephisto
It's true that Servants were trapped here.[sr]But they mutated of their own will.
[k]

＠Evil Mephisto
They all wanted to be that way. There was no need for you to go to considerable length to come and save them.
[k]

＠Evil Mephisto
This apartment is located in a different dimension, yes. But it's only a fake Singularity. It's safe to ignore.
[k]

＠Evil Mephisto
Even if humanity's foundations were restored, this place would simply sit outside the world and quietly gather hatred and pain.
[k]

＠Evil Mephisto
Looking at this sort of hell is my job, which is why I'm here working.

But why are you getting involved?[sr]No one asked you. And this isn't revenge.
