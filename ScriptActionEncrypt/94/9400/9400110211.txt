Hmm... It looked like a famous dragon,[sr]but it didn't feel that strong.
[k]

＠Fergus
Next time, I hope to fight one with the proper mind, body and skill!

That's right, but do not let your guard down. Always[sr]face an enemy, even a weak one, with your full strength.
[k]


＠Fergus
Hmm... Of course, I did not hold back. But are you telling[sr]me to fight until my flesh tears and bone breaks?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Fergus
Hahaha! As expected of Ms. Scáthach![sr]Just how strict can you get?

One of the heroes depicted in the Ulster Cycle, a great[sr]warrior of the Red Branch Knights, Fergus mac Róich...

Um, Fergus.[sr]You're another one of Cú Chulainn's teachers, right?

＠Fergus
Hmm? You mean Setanta?[sr]I did teach him to use a sword, but...
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Fergus
Unfortunately, he wasn't much of a swordsman.[sr]He quickly switched to the spear.
[k]

＠Fergus
I trained with him and also looked after him.[sr]You can say he's almost like my own child.
[k]

＠Fergus
So, do you know him?

Right, it seems they fought together.[sr]In this ruined city ravaged by flames called Fuyuki.

＠Fergus
Sounds like the Norse Ragnarok.[sr]That must be so much fun. I'm jealous.
[k]

＠Fergus
One of his natural talents is having the luck to[sr]be blessed with the most terrifying battles.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Fergus
If I was there, I could've challenged him to see who[sr]was the better warrior. What a shame.
[k]

？1：He was a druid.
？2：He was an amazing mage.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Scáthach
Oh right, now I remember.[sr]They say he was dressed as a druid.
[k]


[charaFace E 2]
＠Fergus
...WHAT!? Was he being bullied?
[k]


[charaFace D 1]
＠Scáthach
Hahaha! Yes, that's the reaction I was looking for.[sr]Nothing really gets funnier than this.

Um, thank you, Fergus. You helped us even[sr]though we summoned you without warning...
[k]


[charaFace E 1]
＠Fergus
Don't worry about it. This was just a temporary contract.[sr]Plus, I couldn't refuse Ms. Scáthach's summon.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Fergus
By the way, what kind of sorcery did you use,[sr]Ms. Scáthach? How was I summoned during my mealtime?
[k]

？1：It is strange, yeah.
？2：I don't think a Holy Grail or its fragment is here, right?

？！

＠Scáthach
You're right, a Holy Grail is not present.[sr]I tampered around with my Primordial Runes.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Scáthach
I used myself as a catalyst, and stocked[sr]Heroic Spirits that I have relations to in this place.
[k]


[charaFace A 6]

Primordial... Runes?

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
Yes. A true "Primordial Rune."[sr]A type of Magical Crest lost in your modern era.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Modern mages have no way of knowing this,[sr]but the runes carved by the Great God of the Norse still exist in this world.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Scáthach
The old runes made after that, and their modern[sr]recreations are not even close in comparison.

＠Fergus
I see, but I don't get it at all. Ms. Scáthach sure knows a[sr]lot! I wish one of us in Red Branch has even a fraction of that intellect.
[k]

？1：Ancient magecraft can do that?
[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
It's more than ancient,[sr]you can say it's from the Age of Gods.
[k]

＠Mash
That's amazing...[sr]Actually, it's really, really, amazing!
[k]

？2：I guess that's Scáthach for you.
[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yeah... She's using a rune from the Age of Gods, made[sr]by an actual god!
[k]

＠Mash
It's unimaginable to us.[sr]If the Doctor was here he'd be going crazy.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
But this explains something I'd been wondering about,[sr]Scáthach.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
Hmm. And what's that?
[k]


＠Mash
I finally understand why Cú Chulainn was using runes.[sr]He learned how to use them from you.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
A Primordial Rune. An ultimate spell brought forth by[sr]the Great God of the Norse.
[k]


[charaFace D 1]
＠Scáthach
Oh, I know that look on your face, Mash Kyrielight.[sr]You were wondering why he didn't use Ulster spells, right?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
Ogham letters don't work well. Runes take effect as[sr]soon as they're drawn, which makes them better for a warrior. That's all.
[k]


[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
I-I see...[sr]I understand that the letters of the Celtic God Ogham...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...are hard to use unless you're a true druid.[sr]Your power isn't affected by its origin, is it?
[k]


[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
It's a matter of effectiveness.[sr]The Great God of the Norse is very kind to warriors.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Scáthach
Now, on to the next location.[sr]Are you ready to face the next remnant?
[k]

？1：I am ready anytime.
[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Yes, Senpai. I don't know how this happened,[sr]but I think I have an idea what we should do.
[k]


？2：YEAH!
[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...Senpai, that was a very powerful response.
[k]

＠Mash
Are you trying to be a Celt?[sr]Are you?
