...Satisfied? Now I'll ask you again...[sr]What were you trying to do?

＠Martha
As the victor... I mean, as the one preaching God's words on the emptiness of conflict, I think I have the right to ask.

＠Kojirou
It's summer! We're on a deserted island! As someone who appreciates elegance, of course I wanted to enjoy this occasion!
[k]

＠Kojirou
I was thinking it should be okay for me to go wild for a bit... But unlike you, my friends...
[k]

＠Kojirou
I was not given the privilege to go wild in a swimsuit!
[k]

＠Kojirou
Why, you ask? Because I am a mere 1-star Servant.

Therefore I was left with no other choice but to transform and add excitement to the occasion. That was the purpose of the mask... you know? YOU KNOW?
[k]


？1：By the way, where did that mask come from...?
？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Kojirou
Heh. You would know nothing about it, my Master... About the zealous union of us common Heroic Spirits! The 1 Star Alliance!
[k]

＠Kojirou
This mask was handed to me by Lord Amadeus.[sr]He told me to use it “if something comes up.”
[k]

＠Kojirou
Lady Martha's fist shattered it...but it was the symbol of our determination...

＠Martha
Fine. I do understand that you wanted to vent your frustration and regret...
[k]

＠Martha
However, let me ask you one more time.[sr]Why did you get in our way?
[k]

＠Martha
The men that went on ahead weren't common rarity, right? In that case, you didn't have the obligation to help them, now did you?

＠Kojirou
Hmm. I asked them to hire me since I thought it'd be a nice chance for Island Mask to play a part...
[k]

＠Kojirou
But I think it would be easier for me to show you what I mean rather than tell you.
[k]

＠Kojirou
A defeated gatekeeper has no choice.[sr]I will show you the way.
[k]

＠Kojirou
...We might run into some monsters along the way, but that won't pose any issue for you, now will it, Master?
