＠Ozymandias
Hm. I see. This is not a bad night.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
The breeze feels nice, and the sky is beautiful.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
And this sense of vastness with no obstructions makes it all the more comforting.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
I detest how this Chaldea place is so confined. Of course, it would not do for me to simply drop my temple onto the site, either.

＠Ozymandias
All right. [%1]. The one who continues to fight leading many Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Do you have business with me, the shining god-king Ozymandias? I'll allow it. State your business.
[k]

？1：I come in all humility, Pharaoh.
？2：A Valentine's Day offering for you.

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Ozymandias
Hm. I know of such offerings.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Nitocris has informed me that this is a custom in this age. Surprisingly, she seems to blend in well with the times.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Have you already met with Nitocris?[sr]If not, do so when you have the time.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ozymandias
She prepared something for me, but I believe she also prepared something for you as well.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
That's the kind of woman she is. She may be the incarnation of the Sky God, but she is still human.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Ozymandias
Unthinkable. To be concerned about others, even as a pharaoh...
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Ozymandias
One need only be self-possessed! If the gods are the reflection of the world, pharaohs must also be so!
[k]

＠Ozymandias
The world can be as it is, and the same goes for pharaohs. They should be as they are to rule and govern!

Well, this might be too complex for her.[sr]And for poor Cleopatra.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
What, Iskandar? [wt 0.3][charaFace A 1]Oh you mean that giant of a man.[sr]He's not half bad.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Ozymandias
But instead of calling him a pharaoh, he's more like...
[k]

＠Ozymandias
No. I shall say no more. I am the pinnacle of all pharaohs. I do not mind that.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Nitocris and Cleopatra can be as they are, too. I suppose being a pharaoh is difficult for someone who is not me.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Ozymandias
...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ozymandias
I have said enough. Heh heh, did you intend to make me chat all day long?
[k]

＠Ozymandias
At any rate, I shall permit your approach.[sr]Your offering, show it to me.
[k]

？1：Please accept this humble gift, Pharaoh.
？2：Happy Valentine's Day!

？！

Oh? This must be a delicacy that the emperors of the Central Americas savored?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ozymandias
A treat both bitter and sweet, molded into many shapes... Chocolate! Of course I know of it. I have studied the modern era extensively.

Your offering pleases me. I acknowledge that this item adequately conveys your sentiment toward me!

＠Ozymandias
Long ago, in a place far from here, in an era not your own...
[k]

＠Ozymandias
...there was once a great battle to the death in a world with which you are unfamiliar! In other words, a Holy Grail War!
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Deep in the sacred temple that was my abode, I encountered two heroes! Well, three, actually, but for our purposes, let us say two!
[k]

＠Ozymandias
One was the Knight of Sky Silver who wielded the sacred sword of his time! The other was a great hero from the East, the Crimson Archer!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Ozymandias
...It was a splendid battle.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
And during that battle, I released a horde of Divine Beasts called Sphinxes. These belong to a superior species that commands all other Sphinxes.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Ozymandias
The father of terror! The savage flame and wind! The incarnation of the sky! They are the very embodiment of divine power, given only to me, God-King Ozymandias!
[k]

＠Ozymandias
They are called Sphinx Wehem Mesut!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ozymandias
...Well, these are its offspring. Charming, are they not?
[k]

？1：I thought your Divine Beasts were Noble Phantasms...
？2：Can a Noble Phantasm have offspring?

？！

＠Ozymandias
Nothing is impossible for a pharaoh![sr]All of creation under heaven is within my grasp!
[k]

？1：I'm not sure I fully understand...
？2：All I know is that you are amazing, Pharaoh.

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Ozymandias
Obviously, these are not the offspring of the Wehem Mesut itself. I used a bit of my magical energy, making them somewhat like clones.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
I command you to raise them well, and you have my leave to treasure them.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Ozymandias
But do not tell Nitocris and Cleopatra. If they hear about this, at best they will faint, and at worst it will put a damper on their Spirit Origin.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ozymandias
Heh heh. I am in a superior mood tonight! Let us ride across the stars in my vessel that rules the sky itself!
[k]

？1：Are you talking about...
？2：The light beam that always comes from offscreen!?

？！

＠Ozymandias
Indeed. I have many vessels on which to ride.[sr]I was summoned as a Rider, after all.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Ozymandias
Now let us take to the skies!
