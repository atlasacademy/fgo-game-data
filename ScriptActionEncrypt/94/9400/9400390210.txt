＠Sanzang
It's coming back to me now![sr]I had three disciples!
[k]

＠Sanzang
Say, disciple! Do you happen to[sr]know about my past disciples?
[k]


？1：Are they a monkey, a pig...and a kappa?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanzang
A kappa? What's a kappa?[sr]No idea what that is... Kapa, kapapa...
[k]


？2：A black panther, a puppy, and glasses.

[charaFace A 5]
＠Sanzang
You mean, a dog, a monkey and a pheasant, right? Huh? Why do I know that...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sanzang
Anyway, speaking of monkeys... Sun... Sun Wukong![sr]My reliable number one disciple!
[k]


？1：So you had pupils before?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanzang
Oh... I'm sorry. I did say I was gonna make you my number one disciple, huh? My bad.
[k]


？2：I'm going to pretend I didn't hear anything.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Sanzang
...Thank you for your thoughtfulness.[sr]You're so kind, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sanzang
But there's no need to worry! I'm sure I'll remember why I lost my disciples during our journey.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Sanzang
But this is a problem. A huge problem, perhaps.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I'm on a journey to Tianzhu, but I wonder why Sun Wukong isn't here.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
Not just Wukong... But the other two pupils too... That's right, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing are not here either...
[k]

＠Sanzang
This must be a message from the Buddha, too.[sr]I mean, journeys are always so mysterious!
[k]


？1：The new number one disciple will take care of it.
？2：You have me now, right?

？！

[charaFace A 3]
＠Sanzang
...W-Wait a minute, what am I getting so flustered for!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Sanzang
I'm impressed that a new disciple like yourself can think like that! But that's prohibited here.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Sanzang
As a disciple, you must follow the Buddha's teachings and worship him. Be careful not to brag too much.
[k]

＠Sanzang
The law of the jungle applies to the journey to Tianzhu. If you are not careful, you will be eaten by demons.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanzang
But... well... considering the hardships we're going to face, having another disciple or two would be reassuring...
[k]

＠Sanzang
For example... Zhu Bajie...
[k]

＠B：???
Oink, oink.
[k]

？1：!?
？2：Oink?

？！

＠B：???
Oink, oink. Oink!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
...What is this!? I'm hearing the squeal of a poor piggy...
[k]


？1：Could it be Zhu Bajie!?
？2：It came from the other side of the rocks...

His name is... David? Just like [%1], he was underneath a rock!

No, no. I'm the cool Zhu Bajie. ...Well, here, at least. That's how things seem to have turned out.

[charaFace A 4]

[%1]'s friend?[sr]Then he's a member of Chaldea, too?

＠Zhu Bajie
I'm saved... Thank you! I couldn't do anything by myself. I thought I was going to become a monster's dinner.
[k]

＠Zhu Bajie
Right, but the situation was about to get much worse.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Zhu Bajie
I was starting to feel good about being squished.[sr]Whew, that was a close one, oink.
[k]


？1：Ah... You saved him...
？2：This guy can have fun anywhere, huh?

？！

[charaFace B 2]
＠Zhu Bajie
It was truly painful! I want to emphasize that part![sr]I mean, I can sue for damages later!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Zhu Bajie
No, let's refrain from talking about that now.[sr]So you are Xuanzang Sanzang... As beautiful as rumored.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Sanzang
...Ummm, don't confuse it with a wedding dress, okay?
[k]

？1：Are you going to ignore the fact she's basically a nun?

[charaFace B 4]
＠Zhu Bajie
Why? There's no problem, right?[sr]Anyway[line 3]
[k]


？2：Too bad, but she's ordained. She's not Abishag.

[charaFace B 2]
＠Zhu Bajie
Not Abishag? NO?![sr]Such a waste! Well, anyway[line 3]
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 3]
＠Zhu Bajie
It's true her beauty makes me want to eat her up!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Zhu Bajie
Hi, my name is Zhu Bajie David. Oh beautiful lady with long black hair, I will gladly become your disciple.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Zhu Bajie
Actually, there's another one stuck under the rock who's fit to be your disciple. He got involved in the same fashion as me.
[k]

＠Zhu Bajie
I guess calling out for help is just too much for his pride.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Zhu Bajie
Jeez. Pride won't earn you a penny, oink.
[k]


？1：You should have a little bit more pride...
？2：Do you know the word “shameless”?

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Sanzang
We'll talk later! Show me where he is![sr]We don't want the rock to crush him!

You have my gratitude for releasing me from this prison. My name is Li Shuwen, an assassin not worth mentioning.

＠Sha Wujing
It seems here I will be known as the third disciple, Sha Wujing... You may refer to me as so from now on.
[k]


？1：Master Li, are you sure?
？2：Becoming a disciple that easily?

？！

[charaFace C 1]
＠Sha Wujing
Well, what's the difference between Servants and Chinese opera actors? It matters not.

＠Sha Wujing
How am I supposed to refuse the wish of a highly respectable monk? That aside[line 3]

Of course. I will behead as many enemies as you'd like and offer you their heads just to serve you well.
