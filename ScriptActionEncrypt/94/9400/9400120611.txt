What's more, these are merely the spoils of your[sr]victorious battle. Now, what shall I give you for your actual, individual presents[line 3]?

Two little girls running in gleeful circles around Asterios...[sr]Heh! That's what a proper Christmas should be.
[k]

？1：...So you already had a reindeer, [&huh?:didn't you?]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Santa Alter
Fool, that one is only for show. If Asterios were to start[sr]running, lightning would streak the sky.
[k]

＠Santa Alter
Which would frighten all the little children.[sr]The best thing for this prince is to have him do nothing.
[k]

？2：Should we go call Euryale?

[charaFace D 0]
＠Santa Alter
Certainly not. If that wicked goddess were here,[sr]she would turn these pure, young girls into demons!

？！

...In any case, our work here is done. Even if it is only[sr]a dream for one night, enjoy yourselves heartily.

...while that Santa was talking with us, they suddenly said, “Uh-oh. This won't do!”

[charaFace F 5]
＠Nursery Rhyme
“Since I'm not the real Santa Claus, I won't be able to fulfill your wishes. But the real Santa Claus is sure to show up soon.”

＠Nursery Rhyme
“Please be good girls and wait patiently until then. What? If you can't do that, I'll try to do something for you next year.”
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Nursery Rhyme
And after saying that, that Santa disappeared[sr]somewhere. She may have been a fake, but she was a cool Santa too!
[k]

＠Nursery Rhyme
Well, good-bye, Santa! And Santa's reindeer![sr]Thank you for bringing presents all the way out here!
