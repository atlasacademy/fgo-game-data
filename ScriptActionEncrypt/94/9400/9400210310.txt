Hm? What? If you need the restroom, you'll have to go outside or go inside a room.

＠Mash
No, that's not it...[sr]This is an apartment, right?
[k]

＠Mash
This place feels cold regardless of the temperature outside. Police officers and residents still walk around despite being dead.
[k]

＠Mash
It's obviously unconventional in modern Japan. In that case, this place must be a magecraft workshop built in secrecy, right?

[charaFace D 5]
＠Ryougi Shiki
If it were, it wouldn't be quite so bad... Unfortunately, this apartment was built in public with no secrets.

A permit was submitted to the local office, and a normal construction company worked on it.

...It's a barrier created using man's natural instinct to avoid taboos...without a single trace of Magecraft.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's common sense for mages after the 20th century to conceal their workshops in order to avoid detection from the public.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
However, we can't detect any traces of magical energy from this place.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If it's a magecraft workshop, then whoever created it must be really cautious and patient.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That mage built a building this size to perform a ritual, yet didn't rely on Magecraft.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They simply built this place from the ground up, brick by brick, all by themselves. Kind of like building a tower.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Which reminds me of buddhist folklore that talks about children stacking rocks in hell, with all effort and no gain.

Just simply continuing a mundane task without complaint, and without companionship.

＠Ryougi Shiki
But you're wrong, it's not a nice place like that. This is simply a building that collects death.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Death by natural causes, illness, accidents, and violence. An exhibit hall decorated with various methods of death.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Those zombies wandering the hallways, they're, you know... The previous residents of this building.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
They're designed to live one day, and die the next. Even though they already died many years ago.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
...I know this might sound obvious, but humans are born with a certain fate.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
No matter how much you fight back, your eventual end[line 2]the cause of your death[line2]will never change.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Those destined to die in an accident, whether they've achieved happily ever after,
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
or an abrupt demise, their lives will end in a form of “accidental death.”
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
...There used to be a guy who was trying to prove that, and the residents of this apartment were merely “samples” for his theory.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
When night falls, they die. When morning comes, they are reborn. No matter what happens, they always die the same way.
[k]



＠Ryougi Shiki
It's a loop, no, a retry. Since before you guys came here, people have been coming back to life and dying, endlessly.

If we were in front of a station, just Mash changing into her Servant form would get us in trouble with the police.

I didn't talk about this a lot, but Chaldea is what you would call “a secret organization.”

You can't recklessly summon your Servants nor arm Mash in front of people.

It depends on the city, but Mash's Servant form could be considered indecent in some places.

You see, the previous tenant of this room had a bizarre hobby... He would sever the limbs of his loved one every night.

He did it to hide the dead body? But get this! He tripped and accidentally killed himself while cutting up the body in the bathroom!

Well, you see, now he's just in the way, right? I mean, he must be bored to death now that he can't accidentally kill himself anymore?
