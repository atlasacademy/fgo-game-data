＠Medb
Oh, there you are! I found you, Master!
[k]

[charaFace A 14]

＠Medb
How dare you make me go through all that trouble![sr]If you were in Connacht, you would face severe punishment!
[k]

？1：Are you perhaps...
？2：Giving me Valentine's Day chocolates?

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Medb
Yep. Isn't this an event for lovers?[sr]Though I thought it was a day when birds mated!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Medb
Well, whatever. I understand that today is a day for chocolates! That's all that matters!
[k]

＠Medb
I am Medb. Queen Medb! I make all the decisions for yesterday, today, and tomorrow!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Medb
...Anyway, here you go.

＠Medb
That's right. You should be thankful. Any warrior would be thrilled to receive a present from me!
[k]

[charaFace A 14]

＠Medb
Actually, you know, it's super-duper-extra-extraordinarily rare for me to give someone a gift without getting anything in return.
[k]

＠Medb
...As such, you should make sure never to forget this precious moment!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Medb
Got it?
[k]

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Medb
That's right! It's a chocolaty demonstration of my true love!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Medb
I prepared it especially for you, for this very occasion. A truly loving gift, a romantic gift[line 2]some chocolate to demonstrate the true depth of my feelings for you...
[k]

＠Medb
Well... This loving gift is the lowest-ranked of its kind. But you're not going to complain, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Medb
Tee hee, right?♡
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Medb
Okay. Delivery of loving, romantic gift number one, done with grace and beauty. I was a bit bewildered because it was my first time, but I was brilliant as ever.
[k]

＠Medb
I've proven to myself that there's nothing I can't do, even if it's a custom of a different era.
[k]

＠Medb
Oh, by the way, Master.[sr]Do you know where my Cú is?
[k]

＠Medb
It doesn't matter which Cú. Actually, you might as well tell me the whereabouts of all my Cús.
[k]

＠Medb
Where is the ordinary blue Cú carrying the crimson lance? Where is the slightly younger and armored Cú?
[k]

＠Medb
Where is the Cú that's dressed like a druid?[sr]And, of course...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Medb
Where is MY cute and valiant-looking fanged Cú?
[k]

＠Medb
Oh, and Fergus.[sr]Would you know where he is?
[k]

？1：I think...
？2：Uhhh...

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Medb
Uh-huh. I see. Got it. Thank you.
[k]

＠Medb
A queen like myself could not possibly be seen giving her love only to Master.
[k]

＠Medb
It is only right and proper for every wonderful warrior to receive my love.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]

＠Medb
As for your chocolate, I want you to savor it as if it were the essence of life itself. Got it?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Medb
See you around, Master. I love you!
[k]
