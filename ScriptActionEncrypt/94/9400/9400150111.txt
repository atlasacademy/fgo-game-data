That was pretty good for a warm-up match.[sr]If I have to compare... Yes... Just like warm-up exercise!
[k]

＠X
That is to say, you're all still novices! Like preschoolers who can't even wake up in the morning!

Right. When my hand slipped and accidentally hit her in the shin, she kept saying “It doesn't hurt at all” despite the tears welling up in her eyes...
[k]

？1：She must really hate losing...
？2：No doubt about it, she's an Altria...

No, to be honest, I was holding back.[sr]I didn't ambush you from the dark...
[k]

＠X
...bury land mines, or kidnap anyone important to you, did I?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Ah, well...that certainly was a fair and square fight, very much like the Saber Class.
[k]

＠Mash
By the way...who are you, anyway? If my eyes were not mistaken, you came out of that rocket...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠X
Humph! Thank you for finally asking!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠X
I'm Heroine X![sr]I'm the Saber of Sabers! I'm the ultimate Saber!
[k]

＠X
I am the one and only holy sword wielder in this universe, an one-for-all kind of Saber!

＠Mash
The Saber of Sabers... So you're a Grand Class?[sr]Or wait, but... Your class is...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠X
Silence. You call yourself Shielder or whatever, but as a freshman in the Fate world, you cannot see the truth.
[k]

＠X
What you can see with your eyes is not all that there is.[sr]To get along in the world, sometimes you must turn your eyes from the truth and let it remain ambiguous.
[k]

？1：Everyone with your look is a Saber.
？2：That's right. The details don't matter.

？！

[charaFace D 3]
＠X
...[sr]A Master that understands... Very nice...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
...It's Heroine X, right?[sr]Explain why you attacked us so suddenly.
[k]

＠Mash
After that, I would request that you leave immediately.[sr]We are busy with Lily's training.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠X
You've hit the nail on the head, Shieldy! I told you that[sr]I'm the ultimate Saber Class Servant, right?
[k]

＠X
From where I stand, I cannot overlook that feeble Saber there.
[k]

＠X
I have a very important mission,[sr]though I cannot speak of it.
[k]

＠X
At any rate! You call yourself Saber Lily, right? What you need now is special training and a teacher that you can respect!

I said that you need a teacher! You require the help of a great Senpai that has fought many years as a Saber!

[charaFace D 1]
＠X
Therefore, you're quite fortunate.[sr]As expected of me, the one with A rank luck.
[k]

＠X
What I, Heroine X, hide is my First Class Saber Teaching License.
[k]

＠X
It was fate that forced Du Stallion II to crash land here.[sr]Let me show you that I'm a first-rate Saber!

＠X
Nice answer! I like you! Let's get started. I shall now explain exactly what kind of training you shall undergo.
[k]

＠X
You will gather the three kinds of materials that possess mysterious powers which are spread across this world.
[k]

＠X
They have fallen from my spacecraft. If you don't gather them and repair it, I cannot return home.
[k]

？1：That's a pretty selfish training regimen...
？2：Wow, a Servant from outer space...

？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Lily
You can't return home... I feel so sorry for you...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Lily
All right! Leave this to me![sr]I need to gather materials and repair that vehicle, right?

...Right. I'm usually not one to trust in others, but since things are generally going my way, I'll let it slide.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠X
Now I shall tell you the true details of your training.[sr]This spacecraft will probably summon a large number of monsters.
[k]

＠X
It is a very out-of-place object.[sr]There's about as much wealth here as all of England.
[k]

＠X
Therefore, it is obvious that huge mobs will descend on it to make it their own.
[k]

＠X
Your job is to fight these lawless bands, defeat them, and gather superparticles called “Altrium.”
[k]

＠X
Altrium are energy particles present throughout the universe. It seems impossible, but if we can get some,[sr]I can make this work.

You there, Shieldy, Master, you're not going anywhere. It's too late, so give it up.

At any rate! Once you have gathered enough Altrium,[sr]I shall power up Lily by myself.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠X
Explanation complete! If you want more details, then gather spacecraft materials and Altrium!
[k]

＠X
From now on we must be fierce as demons.[sr]We will cut down all Saber-faces we run into.
[k]

＠X
Even if they're not Saber-faces, just looking like one is also a sin! So we'll cut down the likes of Jeanne d'Arc, too!
[k]

＠X
A Saber's dignity rests on battle. Experience and learn this. Now[line 3]begin your warrior training, Lily!
[k]

？1：This is way beyond crazy. This is insanity!
？2：Now begins a crazy battle that's supposed to help Lily!
