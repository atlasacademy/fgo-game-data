Wait, hold on, Master.[sr]I know how you feel, but please listen to me.
[k]

＠Emiya
Due to my special nature, I am familiar with modern events such as Valentine's Day.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Emiya
Therefore, shouldn't you view my actions as a way[sr]to remove any elements that might cause you trouble?

That's why they call you the most overprotective Servant in Chaldea. We understand your motives now, but can you share the details with us?

I object to that overprotective statement...[sr]But fine, I'll ignore that for now.

＠Emiya
Master. The people trying to send you chocolates are not normal humans.
[k]

＠Emiya
That's right[line 2] They are Servants, heroes of the past! They are a group of people abnormal in all kinds of ways.
[k]

＠Emiya
Capability, mentality, skill, and berserk level, they are the best in almost everything.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Emiya
There's no way they would simply make some chocolate, send it to you, and just end it there.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Emiya
I am certain. Something bad will happen to you.[sr]Without a doubt, it'll be GG for you!
[k]

＠Emiya
To stop my Master from walking into a minefield, it's obviously my duty as a Servant[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Emiya
No, my duty as a friend who has a heart. I understand the consequences greatly. I had lady issues, too!

Hmm. My words alone are not enough to convince you?[sr]I thought as much, so I brought over a special guest.

＠Diarmuid
I didn't think too much and accepted some chocolate during a certain Holy Grail War! Then an intense confrontation unfolded right in front of me!
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Diarmuid
I could have stopped it if it was just a fistfight.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
But there's no way I could stop two people from stabbing each other with words while smiling.

[charaFace C 5]

What awaited me was endless stomach ulcers...

Chocolate is dangerous, Master.[sr]It will mislead people!

Master. Don't forget that the future of mankind depends on you.
[k]

？1：But, everyone gets sulky without chocolate, right?
？2：I feel like it's better to receive some.

？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Emiya
...Oh boy. It seems we can't convince you.[sr]In that case, we will stop you with brute force.

Master! Even if I, Diarmuid, must point my blade at the one I serve[line 2]
