Hmm... I guess that's it, then.[sr]Hahaha! [charaFace D 1]I figured it would be hard to actually win.

＠Alexander
To get so close and still be so far...[sr]That's what is sad about being a fake, isn't it?

That's not true. It was a fight between Servants,[sr]and you lost. That's all.

Look. She may be real, but look at her. It's fine to worry about where you came from, but stupid to compare it.

Whatever. Thanks for the nice speech.[sr]In exchange, I'll tell you what you want to know, I guess.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Alexander
But all I can really tell you is your next destination.
[k]

＠Alexander
There are counterfeit workshops all over the place.[sr]They're spreading fakes of Da Vinci's works little by little.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Alexander
But I don't know what her goal is,[sr]not in the slightest!
[k]

＠Alexander
Why? Because my job's to be innocent! I haven't been told anything about what goes on behind the scenes.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Alexander
I mean, it's not that hard to figure out.[sr]But it would be rude to tell.

Hmm, nope, I guess.[sr]I hate sympathy.

＠Alexander
I don't... Neither does she. I'm a fake, so I'll just disappear when my expiration date arrives.
