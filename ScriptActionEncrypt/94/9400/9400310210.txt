＠El-Melloi
To be honest, the Holy Grail War in Fuyuki is basically a scam.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
The whole “battle royale for the chance to grant your wish” format is just an outright lie to lure in participants.

A lie? That's terrible... Tricking someone by telling them their wishes will be granted... That's criminal!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
It absolutely is. If these Holy Grail Wars were a widespread thing in a different world, I bet there'd be a lot of lawsuits being filed over them.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
That being said, in this world...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
That is, in my world, that didn't happen.[sr]That's because Holy Grail Wars only took place here.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

＠El-Melloi
It was an insidious trap. One that, with the defeat of each participating Servant, means an unprecedented disaster draws closer.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
When the required number of summoned Servant have been sacrificed, “All the Evils of the World” Aŋra Mainiiu will activate.
[k]

？1：All the Evils of the World?
？2：That's a pretty dangerous-sounding name.

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
You don't need to know everything. Just consider it something like a bomb that could destroy the world.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠El-Melloi
It has more than enough power to wipe out the entirety of human history up to that point.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠El-Melloi
Singularity F, the first foundation you all have restored...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
I see that as the likely state of Fuyuki after the conclusion of the Fifth Holy Grail War.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
The first point to fall as the world crumbled. All because a ritual that should have never been carried out was indeed completed.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
But why would someone set a trap like that?[sr]Who would do that?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
This ritual started off with a very different purpose, and became what it is through a ridiculous man-made disaster.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
That disaster is a “past event” even in this timeline.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
At any rate, the problem is that the paradox Sheba detected in this era is like a Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I see, if the Holy Grail is already here...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Yes. If the Holy Grail has already manifested, this city should be in flames right now. But at a glance, that's not really the case.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
So the Holy Grail detected by Chaldea is likely something different from Fuyuki's Greater Grail, corrupted by Aŋra Mainiiu.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
If I recall, this Fourth Holy Grail War is still in its early stages now. Tonight is when everything moves into motion. We can use that.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Ah, I see. So that's why you've been so conscious of the time today.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
That's right. Right now, it's critical that we stay ahead of events. This harbor district will be the key.
[k]

？1：What's going to happen here?

？！

＠El-Melloi
Hmm, it seems we have to end our chitchat before I get to explain that. The events have caught up to us.

That is one of the seven Heroic Spirits summoned into the Fourth Holy Grail War. Class Saber, Altria Pendragon.

＠El-Melloi
That being the case, sorry, but we will be your opponent now instead of Lancer.
[k]

Irisviel von Einzbern.

Okay, [%1], time for Round 2. But this opponent is quite powerful. She's on an entirely different level from Assassin.

I realize I'm shoving you into a rather difficult fight, but unfortunately, I need to put one more restriction on you.

...I'm sorry, but don't defeat Saber here.[sr]Only push far enough to make her retreat.
