As always, my liege has good eyes.[sr]It appears some seaweed washed ashore... or not.

＠Diarmuid
It's a dead body! The man must have drowned and quietly drifted ashore during that frenetic battle.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
I suppose we should give him proper rites and bury him.

＠Blackbeard
YES to beautiful girls, HELL NO to burial.[sr]I'm...still...alive... (twitch twitch)

＠Blackbeard
Based on my observation of this land from the sea,[sr]I don't have a single clue of where we are.
[k]

＠Blackbeard
The alignment of the stars in the sky makes no sense.[sr]It doesn't help pinpoint our location at all.

Any other information?

Ah, cripes, me vission is getting blurry...[sr]All the blood rushin' elsewhere?

...The open ocean... High, battering waves... Even the tide is complicated and mysterious. Impossible for any ship to make a decent journey.

Heh heh, heh heh heh. I figured it out after investigating this land from the sea. The final conclusion[line 3]

＠Blackbeard
This is... a desert island!

Haha lololol. A desert island... Impossible to escape...[sr]A harem lifestyle's inevitable. Men'll be mobbed by the ladies!
