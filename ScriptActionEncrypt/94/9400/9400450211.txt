Ugh, how disappointing.[sr]Oni or not, their heads roll all the same.

＠Ushiwakamaru
However, the fact remains that they were extraordinary opponents.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Oni are far stronger than humans and are driven by stronger desires. You can call them the manifestation of evil.

＠Ushiwakamaru
Fortunately their numbers are few.[sr]However, the problem is[line 2]

＠Mash
...Yes. It has become more apparent that there is definitely something wrong with this island.
[k]

＠Mash
It looks like it came straight out of a fairy tale.[sr]On top of that, menacing oni actually live on it.
[k]

＠Mash
Based on this information, this place must be[line 2]
[k]

？1：Can it be... Onigashima?
？2：I knew it... Onigashima?

？！

＠Mash
Yes. It only makes sense to assume so.

＠Dr. Roman
No wonder the data on this island doesn't match that of the previous Singularities. I know it's unbelievable, but it seems we're in the world of fairy tales.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Oni-type Servants aside, the fact that there are plain and simple oni living on this island is all the evidence we need.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It goes without saying, but there is no record of this island in the seas around Japan.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I can't even pinpoint the temporal coordinates of that island. Well, something similar happened last time in Heian-period Kyoto...

＠Ushiwakamaru
That's correct. Even I am not aware of this island.[sr]It probably did not exist during my brother's lifetime.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
...What a waste. If islands this interesting truly existed,[sr]I am certain I could have pleased my brother this time around...

Hmmm. Something that shouldn't exist is there.[sr]A fantasy that's never meant to be is manifesting.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That island is also part of the abnormality.[sr]In other words, there's a possibility it was created.

＠Mash
An island of this size?
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
It is not impossible. In Japanese mythology, the islands that make up Japan were created by the gods.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Have you heard the tale of Amenonuboko? The gods formed the island and created the nation with their Authority.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Anyway, I can tell you about that later.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even though that island was mentioned in human history, it didn't actually exist in history.
[k]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
So someone made fairy tales, fantasy, into reality?
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Yes. That also means whoever made that island must be quite powerful.

＠Ushiwakamaru
Building an island that never existed before...[sr]That most certainly is not something a human could do.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
It would be difficult for my brother as well. Politically. Which means... Yes, our enemy is clear.
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Both oni and the island Onigashima...[sr]Yes, I would agree the answer is clear.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But it is still too soon to draw any conclusions.[sr]I want you to investigate with extreme caution.
