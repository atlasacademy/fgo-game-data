＠Nitocris
You are before a pharaoh. Not only must you make way, but you must also bow your head and avert your gaze!
[k]

＠Nitocris
Disrespect will not be tolerated!
[k]

[charaChange A 5012001 9 fade 0.3]

＠Nitocris
...At least, that is what I would normally say, but today is a special day.
[k]

＠Nitocris
I could simply ignore all of this, and say that I have no interest in holidays from foreign lands with heathen gods, but I will not do that.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Nitocris
Yes, yes. At times, even pharaohs can be tolerant of other beliefs.
[k]

＠Nitocris
I have seen and learned of many things.[sr]I may not be at the level of the great Ozymandias...
[k]

＠Nitocris
...But like the great god-king pharaoh... I shall adopt a stance of tolerance and acceptance myself.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Nitocris
And so, rejoice, my ally!
[k]

？1：Y-yes.

[charaFace A 0]

＠Nitocris
Haha!
[k]

＠Nitocris
That's right. Like that. That is the kind of reverence you should have when addressing me, my ally.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

？2：Are you perhaps giving me chocolates?

[charaFace A 3]

＠Nitocris
Wha...!?
[k]

＠Nitocris
How could you just come out and say it like that!? I was trying to make the conversation naturally flow to that!
[k]

＠Nitocris
So why!? Why would you be so blatant about it!?
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Nitocris
Arrrgh...
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Nitocris
...No. That was just a rite of the Medjed! I'm just going to say that you saw or heard nothing, like a covered Medjed!
[k]

？！

＠Nitocris
Lower your head![sr]You must wait in anticipation with your head bowed!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Nitocris
...Yes. Like that. Like one prostrating [&himself:herself].
[k]

＠Nitocris
So, here is my gift to you. As the incarnation of the sky god and wielder of the Mirror of the Underworld...
[k]

＠Nitocris
I bestow upon you my chocolate.[sr]This is truly special.
[k]

＠Nitocris
O mage who lives modestly in this age, behold the Ancient Egyptian chocolate that combines both nobility and mystery!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Nitocris
Um, you don't need to bow anymore. If you keep your head down, you won't see my chocolate.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Nitocris
...Yes, that's good. Here.[sr]Please take it.
[k]

It is a gift from a pharaoh. I would not blame you if you collapsed with tears in your eyes and expressed your gratitude with your entire body.

Actually, I would very much like for you to do that.[sr]That way, I could see the fruits of my hard work.
[k]

＠Nitocris
...No, never mind.
[k]

[charaChange A 5012001 6 fade 0.3]

＠Nitocris
The Medjed accompanying it are my sentiments towards you. Hee hee, do you understand?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Nitocris
Savor it gratefully. Leaving any leftovers would be the height of insolence!
