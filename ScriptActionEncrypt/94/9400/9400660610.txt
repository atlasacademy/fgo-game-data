＠Blackbeard
Feel free to beat me and take my spot in the Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen, if you want! Pew pew pew!

＠Mash
Blackbeard, let us confirm one thing...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
You are one of the people behind this, are you not?
[k]

＠Mash
We need to know the truth, so we can put an end to this.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mash
If you are plotting something that will make innocent girls cry, even I cannot defend you. Keep that in mind!

Oh, so nice. You're still trying to believe in me...

＠Blackbeard
Mash is so wonderful... So radiant...[sr]That stuff really turns me on...
[k]


＠Blackbeard
Trying to defend trash like me...[charaFace D 1] Are you the type of girl who can only love a loser?

Ahah. You really are a goddess, Chloe.[sr]And Mash is an angel.

＠Blackbeard
But you're girls, too. It might be worth listening to what I have to say!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Blackbeard
You see, once a man's got a treasure, he loses interest in it.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Blackbeard
But you know, I hate to work hard![sr]I don't want a girl who's way out of my league!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Blackbeard
I want somebody close yet just out of reach.[sr]That's the type of treasure I want.
[k]

？1：Is that your ideal magical girl...?
？！

[charaFace D 5]
＠Blackbeard
You'd think that, right!? But get real![sr]I'd never get anyone that way!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Blackbeard
There's gotta be some indignity in there! Build up a sweet relationship, and then, BAM! Like a boss-pirate!
[k]

＠Blackbeard
That's what makes for good entertainment, right!? Playing it safe is boring!

Fanboys have their own set of rules, but the pirate's way compels him to break the rules and take what he wants.

＠Blackbeard
Yes! Let there be light in the heart of magical girls everywhere! Just like there's always indignity in my heart!

Once you've learned your lesson, come back to Chaldea!
[k]


？2：Okay. It's time for him to be shark bait.
