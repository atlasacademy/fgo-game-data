Even after defeating the oni, the people here won't even move a muscle.

＠Dr. Roman
They don't even have the will to resist. In the end, all we can do is get rid of the one behind everything.

Tch! ...They've all got eyes like dead fish.[sr]The food here must be pretty damn awful...
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
If I had the time, I'd go around and knock some golden energy into every single one of them.
[k]

[charaFace F 7]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Actually before that, they need breakfast.[sr]You can't get any energy if you got nothing to burn.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
If only Tawara was around...[sr]That way I could at least make some rice balls...
[k]

[charaTalk E]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
...Kintoki...making...rice balls!?[sr]Kintoki can cook!?

＠Sakata Kintoki
S-So what, you got a problem with that? It's just rice balls, of course I can make them. I'm a man after all.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I mean, despite the way I look, I was brought up by a wealthy samurai general.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Even if we did nothing, we'd get served one hellavuh meal for breakfast. That just ain't my style.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I get really nervous if I gotta worry about table manners starting from breakfast, ya know? Rice balls are enough for me.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I always say something simple for breakfast is best, yet my subordinates somehow always got obsessed over it and would bring me too much!
[k]

[charaTalk F]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Ain't that right! I wanted to get out and play as fast as[sr]I could. I didn't want to just sit around eating all day!

Yeah, sounds like the kind of things said by boys that really gave their mothers a headache...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]

＠Dr. Roman
At any rate, Kotarou, you and Kintoki seem to get along well. Are you fine with that?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You are the head of the Fuuma clan, right? Don't you think it would be bad for you to be getting along with an outlaw?
