Wait, you came back from the Throne of Heroes!?[sr]That isn't even self-summoning, it's self-manifestation!

Well, I hadn't actually made it all the way back, so the rest was fighting spirit. Like, “Eeeeyaaa”♡

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
So you were able to hold out against a banishing with fighting spirit... Kintoki, what's going on with your mother?

When Lord Raikou makes up her mind, she just manages to slip through the cracks.

Despite her looks, she's got ten times my spirit. When it comes to forcing her way through, she'll get through, no matter who's in her way.

Like they say, an oni god can move mountains! When I think that I have inherited that blood... How promising!
[k]

？1：Yes, indeed...

＠Ushiwakamaru
Yes! I too am devoting myself to being able to suddenly appear if you're in dire straits, even without being summoned, Master!

Y-Yes... Certainly, in that way, Yoshitsune and Raikou are similar.

Servants can't grow, so therefore don't age, but you never know. There may come a time when I do become my mature self.

Heh. Please look forward to that day, Master.

The great oni that were guarding the gate, right?[sr]Senpai already disposed of them.
[k]

[charaTalk G]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
No, those monsters are connected with this island.[sr]As long as the island exists, they won't go away forever.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
The problem is... the more those great oni are defeated, the stronger they get.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Right about now, they're probably reviving from your slaying. And they may try to get off this island.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
They're evil oni and they've got their eye on total destruction.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
If Onigashima ceases to exist, they'll vanish for good, but if left ignored, they could do real harm.

Wh-Why did you give them power like that!?

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Aren't you entrusted with restoring humanity or something like that? Then why not put your skills to the test here?
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Yes, yes, in fact, that's a great idea! Ah, despite the fact that I created them, there is no need to hold back.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
It will make a thousand... even ten thousand oni seem like millet served in a bowl.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Please enjoy slaying the great oni until Onigashima vanishes♡
[k]

？1：What if we slack off?
？2：What if I said I just wanted to go home?

？！

[charaFace G 1]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Oh. In that case, I myself will become an oni. (Grin)

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Young people mustn't pick up the bad habit of laziness. Therefore, insolent children will be punished.

[charaFace G 3]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
This is hard on your mother, too... but naughty children require discipline.

＠Sakata Kintoki
And if you refuse, she'll cry.[sr]In public or wherever, she'll bawl her eyes out.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
It's more embarrassing for anybody standing next to her. So all you can do is obey.

Well, I guess we'll just have to resign ourselves to it![sr]Besides, it'll be fun putting Raikou in our debt!

Let's do this, Boss! We can have a chicken race to see which of us kicks more oni ass!
