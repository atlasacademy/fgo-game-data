My letter should be arriving soon. Not that I normally[sr]take any notice of Christmas or whatever it is[line 3]
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
That wretched Saber is sure to dress in that manner of[sr]getup. Such frivolity... Who would've thought she would answer to such needs so faithfully.

[charaFace E 3]
＠Gilgamesh
It is praise-worthy for a king to endeavor to meet his[sr]subjects' expectations. Even I could perhaps learn from her example. But of course, I won't.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Gilgamesh
No, that is not the vital point in this. What I should[sr]truly take note of is the institution of Christmas!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
It is said that however reserved and modest a woman[sr]can be, on Christmas, she cannot help but speak the truth of her heart!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Gilgamesh
Ahh, I can't imagine any future but one in which she will[sr]confess her feelings for me! Very well. I shall allow it! Thank me for the good service!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Now, come quickly, Dark Santa! I shall make you understand our difference through my treasury!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Fwahahaha! And then, perhaps I will say something like,[sr]“You, yourself, are my Christmas present, aren't you?”

Reindeer! We have the night off thanks to Gilgamesh's[sr]grand delusions.

＠Santa Alter
And we happen to be floating above a great city.[sr]What don't we enjoy ourselves in its entertainment quarter?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Santa Alter
Though there are but rustic eateries here in ancient Uruk,[sr]they should have good, simple food to dine upon.

＠Santa Alter
I, myself, favor that dish of wheat flour mixed with water[sr]and stuffed with various fillings that is then baked upon an iron plate and then basted with sauce afterward.

Since it's...Christmas...[sr]We were thinking we'd like something warm too.

...Yeah. That's why, even though we knew[sr]that it was wrong...

[line 3]Upon this extraordinary day, the two of you felt that you, alone, were not special?
