What did this little one say?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Scáthach
That something strange has been happening on this island. I couldn't just ignore that information.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Scáthach
Somehow I always manage to scare the piglets away just by looking at them.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Scáthach
It'd be quite troublesome to have my guide always run away from me, obviously. That's why I brought you here.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Marie
I see... You are very beautiful, but you always have this stern look on your face.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Marie
I'm sure that's just how warriors and knights are, but you're wearing a swimsuit now. You should smile.

I was thinking the same thing... Somehow she still has a very intimidating look even though she's in a swimsuit.
[k]

＠Mash
I guess Scáthach will be the same no matter where she goes.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Also, I think she's still treating the boar piglets like some kind of vermin...
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

...You're the Queen of the Land of Shadows.
[k]

＠Marie
With the amount of responsibility you have, I think you'd be much better off smiling more.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Marie
Oh... Perhaps it's because I've never ruled a nation? Would I be more like you if I did?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Scáthach
It's just who I am... There's nothing I can do.[sr]I was, after all, a gatekeeper.
[k]

＠Scáthach
The Land of Shadows gets all kinds of nasty visitors.[sr]It was my job to drive them away.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Scáthach
Besides, there are different kinds of queens out there. Medb, for example, is more similar to you than me.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Marie
Medb looks like she's having fun every day.[sr]I actually quite like her.

＠Marie
But all her talk about love... might just be a little too difficult for me to understand...

Or maybe it's a holy oil death match, where you're not allowed to use weapons...

Yes, Master.

It's only about the size of a manhole... but it's causing all the plants in the area to wilt.
