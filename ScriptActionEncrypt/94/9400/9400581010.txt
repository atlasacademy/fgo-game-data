＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Ahhhh... An open-air bath really does have a certain charm to it, doesn't it?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Look around.[sr]There are many lovely things surrounding us.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
To be able to experience directly through my skin...this is the true charm of an open-air bath.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
The beautiful moon, the rustling trees, the eerie calls of strange birds flying by... Um, perhaps ignore the last one.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Ummm, oh yes. The loveliest one of all is of course your wonderful socialite-fox-wife soaking next to you in the water.
[k]

？1：D-Do we really need to bathe together?
？2：(I'm not sure where I should look.)
？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Come on, we're both wearing swimsuits, so it's fine.[sr]It's no different from our usual manner.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
You really are adorably innocent, Master.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
In any case, the whole purpose of this occasion is to assess whether we can make proper use of this bathing establishment.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
It will be pointless if we don't fully relax while we're here. Which is why I came prepared with a few things.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Here's a wooden pail with a Japanese-style wine flask.[sr]It only has water inside, but I wanted you to try it out.
[k]


？1：Hydration is important.
？2：I actually did want to try it, at least once.
？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
You downed that wonderfully. (Clap clap)
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
It would have been an even more lively moon-viewing party if Shuten had been here.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Though I can easily imagine it getting out of hand very quickly...
[k]


？1：I prefer a quiet night tonight.
？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Hee hee, yes, indeed. After all, we've got the open-air bath all to ourselves.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Let's savor our alone time a bit more.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
So how about we have a candid talk while we bathe together?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I'm prepared to fully answer any questions Master throws at me.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
For example...what I'm doing with my prized tail while I'm soaking in the water.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
To be honest, it's a tad embarrassing...but if Master would like to know, you may go around to my rear to take a look.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Or perhaps...perhaps you would like to reach around to feel everything yourself?
[k]
