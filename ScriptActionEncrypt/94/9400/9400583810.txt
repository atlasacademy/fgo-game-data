＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Mikon! Just look at this splendid five-storied pagoda towering over this desert island! It defies explanation! And that's the best part!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Thank you very much, Master.[sr]What made you decide on this?
[k]

？1：Huh? I just sort of picked...
？2：I wanted to see your smile, Tamamo.

[charaFace D 3]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
D-Don't say things like that with a perfectly straight face!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
If you act like that, Master...I have no choice but to stay by your side...or rather, I want you to say more...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
A-Anyway!
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
If that's true, then you didn't have any particular interest in pagodas?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Since we're on the subject, if you have any questions,[sr]I can answer them.
[k]


？1：What are those halo-looking decorations at the top?
？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Oh? So that's where your eye goes first, I see![sr]You have a good eye!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
That entire ornamental piece is called the pagoda's finial. Each part has a meaning, but I'll skip over them for now.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Those nine rings in the middle are called the[sr]“kurin (nine rings)” or “hourin (treasure rings).”
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
They represent the Five Wisdom Buddhas and the Four Bodhisattvas.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Which of course includes Vairocana...[sr]That is to say, Amaterasu!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
The fact that that was what caught your interest first, Master, is proof that you are concerned about me above all things!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Hmm, we really do have extraordinary compatibility!
[k]

？1：I...I see...?
？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
In other words, one could say this pagoda is like a dedication of faith to me. Though it's a rather roundabout one.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I like it even more when I think about it that way![sr]It was worth the effort of having it made for me!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
So from now on, think of this pagoda as if it were me, and treat it with care, Master!
