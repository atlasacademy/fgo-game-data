Usually, there's a hole to return to the original world nearby. So, long as I can find it, I can get back to the previous world.

＠Sukeroku
In the first place, Miyamoto Musashi is known as the most powerful swordsman in the history of Japan. He is said to have lived in the early Edo period.
[k]

＠Sukeroku
The “Niten Ichiryu” he created is a style that utilized both long and short swords, and is considered the quintessential “dual-wielding style” in Japan.
[k]

＠Sukeroku
The many duels Musashi fought with other swordmasters while he was in his twenties are known across the land, and serve as inspiration for a great deal of literature and entertainment.
[k]

＠Sukeroku
Among us oni, Musashi is synonymous with the dual-wielding style, and is both feared and loved at the same time.
[k]

＠Sukeroku
So much so that many oni children would swing around two clubs pretending to be Musashi.

...I see. They say Musashi was born in Ohara, Sakushu.
[k]

＠Sukeroku
His father's name was Shinmen Munisai, the martial arts coach of the Shinmen clan in Takeyama Castle. His lord was the one who gave him the name “Shinmen.”
[k]

＠Sukeroku
Munisai set up a dojo for jitte skills in Miyamoto, Yoshino. Musashi considered this home, so later used Miyamoto as a surname...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
[charaScale A 1.1]
[charaPut A 240,16]

＠Sukeroku
Stories of Miyamoto Musashi are popular, but Shinmen Munisai was incredibly skilled as well.
[k]

＠Sukeroku
Consider that the name he gave himself is “Muni,” which means “unique.” You have to be quite skilled to consider calling yourself that!
[k]

＠Sukeroku
To be unique is to be the singular, ultimate one. In other words, it's a show of a powerful ego asserting none follow in his footsteps.
[k]

＠Sukeroku
Musashi, his son, calling his own style “Niten” is surely respect for his great father[line 3]

＠Sukeroku
Sorry about that. A slip of the tongue. It's just, none of the oni are interested in stories of this sort, so...
