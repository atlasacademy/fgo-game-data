You should know better than that, you fool!

No matter how many swords pierce us, no matter how many spears impale us...
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
We do not stop.[sr]Not until we've had our fill.
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
We are the apex of this filthy existence... and, because we continually devour the souls of others, the embodiment of life!
[k]


＠Ibaraki-Douji
That[line 2]is what an oni truly is!

...Whew. We managed to defend ourselves through that attack, but... it looks like Ibaraki-Douji got away.

＠Mash
I can't believe she could summon up so much latent power...

＠Sakata Kintoki
Yeah, that was basically her last rally.[sr]She won't be able to summon any more of those flames.
[k]


＠Sakata Kintoki
She saves that Noble Phantasm for last, not to destroy her opponent, but to give her cover under which she can run away.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
That's why she can't win against Shuten.[sr]She acts like a ruffian, but deep down, she's submissive.

＠Mash
Ahh. Well, then... What about Shuten?

[charaFace B 1]

＠Sakata Kintoki
She's the exact opposite of Ibaraki. She looks refined on the surface, but she's a true oni inside.

＠Sakata Kintoki
But never mind that now.[sr]We're finally close to finishing this, Boss.

＠Mash
Agreed. We've all been pushing through our accumulating fatigue...
[k]

？1：Yeah. Stay on your guard. Let's go.

＠Mash
Right. After all these battles, I know all too well how terrifying oni can be.
[k]

？2：...Let's win this thing.

＠Mash
Yes, Master. Of course we will.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
Let's take this time to prepare ourselves fully and go into battle in our best possible condition.
[k]



＠Mash
Everything we've done will be for tomorrow's decisive battle[line 2]
