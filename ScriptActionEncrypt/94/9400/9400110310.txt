Sigh... Talk about a disappointment.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Fergus
If this isn't a letdown, then what is?[sr]Yes, this is the prime place for a battle, yet still!
[k]

＠Fergus
I'd also love to go find a nice lady, but with things in this[sr]state there aren't any around! No men, either.

Hah, lust is what makes a hero but you,[sr]you are on a completely different level.

Those bestial urges of yours might be[sr]the source of the power that makes you a hero.

H-Huh? What?[sr]Why are you involving me in this conversation, Scáthach?
[k]


＠Scáthach
His lust is so strong that[sr]no human woman can be his wife.
[k]

＠Scáthach
They all gave up after a few days, and in the end[sr]he married a forest goddess.
[k]

＠Scáthach
That's right, a Divine Spirit. Gods' appearances were[sr]rare to begin with in the Ulster Cycle...
[k]

＠Scáthach
...and one of those very rare appearances was made by[sr]his wife. He was too much to handle a goddess had to show up.
[k]

To tell you the truth, Mash, [%1],[sr]I thought about asking you two...
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Fergus
...but you're being guided by the Ms. Scáthach right now.[sr]You're basically kids, in a sense.
[k]

＠Fergus
I can't be going after kids. Which means, well,[sr]I've got just one option. No, it's not one I was avoiding.
[k]

＠Fergus
As an Ulster man, it's my destiny to someday[sr]make the Lady of Shadows my own...

I-I guess there's no hurry on that one.[sr]First, we've gotta get these kids to safety!
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Fergus
And when that's done![sr]I'll take you up on your offer!
[k]

＠Fergus
First, we fight! If I win, of course, you keep your promise.[sr]But if I lose, we'll talk then!

Hehe. Dauntlessness, desire, vigor and lack of avarice.[sr]A hero must have all these things.

It is a virtue to reflect on oneself in the presence[sr]of the strong. There, there.

I'm sure I'm scared of any fighting...[sr]But [charaFace A 7]I'll fight anyway. Because I need to.

Humph. Even if someday,[sr]the fight may take your life?

Of course. My fear and my life[sr]are two different things.

[charaFace A 12]

And... I know something even scarier.

I already know how sad it is to do nothing,[sr][line 3]the desolation of leaving nothing behind.
