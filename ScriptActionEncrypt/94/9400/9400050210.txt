It's further than I expected, but this town certainly[sr]looks more impressive than I imagined.
[k]

＠Mash
What do you think, Master?[sr]If you like, we could pause here for a moment to rest.
[k]

？1：That sounds good.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
All right then.[sr]Doctor, we're going to take a short break.
[k]

？2：It'd be nice to eat some pumpkin pie.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
!!![sr]Good thinking, Senpai.
[k]

＠Mash
As good as being chosen by Weekly Halloween Magazine to receive the title of “This Autumn's Number One Master,” maybe?
[k]

And here is some tea.

Oh my, I would've thought one's wife would naturally always be at one's side.

[charaFace D 3]
＠Kiyohime
I went to the trouble of hiding for him in a box tied with a bow, but my silly husband is just so indifferent.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Then he went and fell for that unspeakably shady invitation. As your loving wife, I couldn't sit by and do nothing.
