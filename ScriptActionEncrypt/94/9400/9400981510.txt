Theoretically speaking, the steam engine that enables my locomotion essentially realizes the Carnot cycle.
[k]

＠Babbage
Mage. Our paths may differ, but we both accumulate knowledge. Therefore I will state this in a manner even you will understand...
[k]

＠Babbage
The Carnot cycle is one where the heat engine's thermal efficiency reaches its maximum. My steam circulates between high and low heat, through four processes.
[k]

＠Babbage
Namely, isothermal expansion, adiabatic expansion, isothermal compression, and adiabatic compression.

？1：U-um... Come again?
？2：Uh, okay. Got it, that's enough, King of Steam!

？！

＠Babbage
Do you not understand?

In other words, it's a quasi-static cyclic process[sr]that[line 3]

？1：Stop!

Hm.
[k]

＠Babbage
Back to my point. That chocolate that you hold right there is a formidable fuel source for my steam engine.
[k]

＠Babbage
Though my masterpiece here runs on a steam engine, it is intimately connected to magecraft and classified as a Mystic.
[k]

＠Babbage
Am I truly clad in metal and machinery?[sr]Or is this armor simply the embodiment of a Mystic?
[k]

＠Babbage
I do not have the answer. Though I have a suspicion that both are correct, that's all it is... Suspicion.
[k]

？1：...In other words?

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Babbage
These chocolates that can be a source of magical energy... I shall consume them without delay.
[k]

？1：Let's try this again...
？2：Happy Valentine's Day!

＠Babbage
According to Pythagoras of Ancient Greece, the root of all things lies in numbers.
[k]

＠Babbage
Yes. Yes! During the time of Pythagoras, the occult and the rational were intermixed. Just like how my being is.
[k]

＠Babbage
Thus, I shall tell you this: Mage, familiarize yourself with numbers. Learn by numbers.
[k]

＠Babbage
Truths that may be hidden from my eyes, may yet be revealed to yours.
[k]

＠Babbage
Young one who still learns today, you have great potential, and every opportunity to realize it at your fingertips.
[k]
