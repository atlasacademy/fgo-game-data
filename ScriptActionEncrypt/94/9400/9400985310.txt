＠Sanson
Chocolate?[sr]Why yes, I know of it.
[k]

＠Sanson
Back in our day, it was something that had just started getting popular.
[k]

＠Sanson
It was sweet and full of calories, so it was a perfect nutritional item for the sick.
[k]

＠Sanson
Oh, do you have any leftover bits of chocolate? If you do not mind, I could make it into a drink I used to like.

＠Sanson
I added egg yolks to the chocolate and warmed it up.
[k]

＠Sanson
It's sweet, tasty, and good for you.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Sanson
Though, for someone who eats modern cuisine, serving this is a bit embarrassing.
[k]

？1：Thank you.
？2：It gives me strength.
？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanson
I am honored.
[k]


＠Sanson
It is perhaps rude to do so in front of you, but may I try some of the chocolates that you've given me?
[k]

＠Sanson
I would very much like to have a relaxing moment eating sweets.
[k]

？1：Want to invite Marie?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sanson
Marie?
[k]

＠Sanson
...
[k]

＠Sanson
...No, let's not. I had a feeling inviting Marie would be dangerous just now.

No, Marie is always welcome...[charaFace A 4][sr]But I have a feeling Amadeus would tag along...
[k]

？1：Uh...
