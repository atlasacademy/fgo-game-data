＠Dr. Roman
The Singularity response I'm picking up is located at the highest, most remote part of the island.

＠Mash
From what I can see, it looks like a steep, rocky mountain is the highest point of the island.
[k]

＠Mash
It looks like it won't be easy to reach from here.
[k]

？1：Even the longest journey begins with a single step!

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Yes. You're right, Senpai.
[k]

＠Mash
We should progress steadily, one step at a time[line 2][sr]Like the journey we've been on so far.
[k]

？2：Let's see how far we can get.

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Hehe... That's right. Senpai, you always inspire us to go down the right path with your words.
[k]

＠Mash
That may indeed prove to be the shortest way to reach our goal.

By the way, Ushiwaka.[sr]Are you familiar with folklore?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Not just tales from your time, but those popular after that as well.

＠Ushiwakamaru
Yes. You need not worry about that. I, Ushiwaka, have been diligently studying such things in Chaldea.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Naturally, the tale of Onigashima, as well as Kobutori Jisan, Shita-kiri Suzume, The Crab and the Monkey, the Thief Ninja Jiraiya,
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
and many others. I love them! So speaking of Onigashima, the tale of Momotarou is definitely what comes to mind.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Exchanging millet dumplings to gain three companions: a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, and then defeating the oni of Onigashima[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Heh heh! Master, if you are Momotarou, then I must be the dog, eh?
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I myself am a dog person, so all the better. A cat ignores commands, but a dog is devoted to its master.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Ushiwakamaru
If you order me to, I will gladly line the island shore with the heads of all the oni.
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
...Ushiwaka, it definitely doesn't sound like a joke when you say it... Besides, you ARE a master of combat...
