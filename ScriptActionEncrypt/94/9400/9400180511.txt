You know, little girl.[sr]Tea parties are fun.

If you have them together with sugar-packed tea, sugar-packed pastries, and sugar-packed chocolate...
[k]

＠Shakespeare
It will envelope you in a sweet sugary joyfulness.

Unfortunately[line 2]we must not be allowed to enjoy this forever.

H-H-Hell... No way, that's terrible.[sr]B-But you know? I am a Servant!

[charaFace A 0]
＠Shakespeare
Why yes. If you'd been eating normal candy, there's no way you'd get cavities...
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Shakespeare
However, what if a Servant has been eating candy made from another Servant's power? What do you think will happen then?

I-It's just your imagination. My tooth doesn't hurt at all.[sr]It doesn't tingle at all, it doesn't sting at all.

After this, we will have retrieved most of the chocolates.

We're still short on some, but you can recover those at your leisure.

Now people can get back to making their chocolates.[sr]I am sure the ladies (and some men) among the Servants will be happy.

Master can have an easy mind now and receive those chocolates.
