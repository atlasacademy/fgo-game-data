No, you're wrong. You lost and were sealed away.[sr]By your own hand, even.

＠Dr. Roman
Ushi Gozen!? I've heard of that name before.[sr]If I remember correctly, Ushi Gozen is Minamoto-no-Raikou's brother[line 2]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A cursed child born from prayers to Gozu Tenno.[sr]The story goes that ultimately Raikou eliminated him[line 2]
[k]

[charaTalk E]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Yeah, that's the story. Ushi Gozen here is something similar to Lord Raikou's older brother.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
But Gozen is the title for a woman.[sr]You should be able to figure the rest from that.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
...Lord Raikou has never talked about her origins.[sr]Even I had to do a little digging myself.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I will tell you the truth. A child was born as the child of the god Tenjin. Her power was feared so much that she was seen as a cursed child, and thus sent to a temple.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
If only that was where it all ended. That child's father... Well, he probably had some regrets.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
He regretted letting go of her talents. It's predictable what would happen. He welcomed his imprisoned daughter back as his newborn son.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
You all know the rest of the story. Minamoto-no-Raikou lived up to her father's expectation, and became a warrior who protected Kyoto.
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
You mean Ushi Gozen and Raikou weren't siblings, but one and the same person!? But there is a tale that Raikou exterminated Ushi Gozen!
