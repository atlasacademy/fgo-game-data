I'm sure of it! This is the 21st-century Japan, Senpai!

The city seems so quiet and the streets are so clean! The example of a perfectly safe city!
[k]

＠Mash
Unfortunately, I don't see any of those so-called convenience stores[line 2] The places that never sleep!
[k]

＠Mash
It really is just like what I've read...[sr]One of my dreams has come true!
[k]

？1：It was your dream?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Ah... Yes. I'm sorry, I got carried away. It's not that I dreamed of visiting a city in Japan.
[k]

＠Mash
Not only Tokyo, but Washington, Moscow, Beijing, Rome, Madrid...
[k]

＠Mash
Any one of them would have been fine. I just wanted to visit a major city from the era I live in.
[k]

？2：It seems pretty normal...

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Ugh. It's almost like you're saying, “What's so special about a city like this?”
[k]

＠Mash
Senpai, did you live in a city like this one? No, I am sure you did.
[k]

＠Mash
Please tell me more about it, in detail! Everything from your life in elementary school to high school! Please!
[k]

Hello, test, test.[sr]Communication, video feed, both working fine.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Ah, as I thought... Judging from these coordinates and time, I predicted your destination to be a city in Japan.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But... I didn't expect it to be such an urban area. This seems pretty fishy to me...

...You're right. A normal city in a time like this is the most abnormal thing.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
The only two normal life-form responses are from Senpai and myself... But I'm also getting some higher-class life-form responses from that building.
[k]

＠Mash
[line 3]A big city like this, with this many houses, and still no one in sight.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
Building? Oh, that cylindrical one? It sure looks weird...[sr][%1], can you tell us anything about it?
[k]

？1：It's like a spooky tower.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...I agree.[sr]I'm getting chills just looking at it.
[k]

？2：It's just an apartment.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Just an apartment? But its design is so different than the other buildings surrounding it...
[k]

？！

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Anyway, that building is undeniably suspicious. I'm picking up readings of multiple Servants inside as well.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
No obstacles detected from here to the building entrance. Let's go there and... Wait! Senpai!
[k]

＠Mash
There's someone around the entrance! It's[line 3]

I'm picking up multiple strange signals! Residual wills... They're ghosts!

Looks like a Servant is fighting with them!

Yes, Master!

Wait! I'm not picking up any more ghost readings! They didn't disperse, they disappeared[line 3]

As if they were erased with an eraser![sr]That's a little scary, isn't it!? What is it!?

Doesn't matter if you're good or bad. With this knife in your head, you can say goodbye to this reality.
