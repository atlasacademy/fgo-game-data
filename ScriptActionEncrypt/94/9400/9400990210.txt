Why dost thou approach, contractor? The evening bell hath not tolled, nor do I hear the sound of battle.

＠First Hassan
There is no call to put my sword to use now, and I will not abide purposeless toil.

？1：W-was I overstepping my boundaries!?
？2：It's a token of my gratitude!!!

＠First Hassan
Strange. Such a display most foreign seems, and with it thou hast surprised me. Hmph. How have I erred to allow my self to be thus surprised?
[k]

＠First Hassan
Mine own failure as an assassin requires that I humbly accept thy gift. Unfamiliar though this be, I would not be the cause of thy embarrassment.

However, to accept alone would tarnish the name[sr]“Old Man of the Mountain.” 'Tis but a trinket, but accept this in return.

Child of magecraft. Thy battles shall eons seem. Mayhaps this aroma will provide thee some small succor. Mayhaps.
