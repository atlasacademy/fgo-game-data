Whoa... So that's what the Incineration of Humanity was...? You battled and went through a lot!
[k]

＠Musashi
That means you took back our history and future, right? That's amazing. I'm sure everyone praised you for that.
[k]

＠Musashi
So let me add in as a bonus: Good work, [%1]. I'm sure it was a long year for you.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Musashi
Oh, and another thing, Master of Chaldea...[sr]Happy New Year!
[k]

＠Musashi
Thanks to you, I can continue my journey!
[k]

？1：I was helped by so many around me.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Musashi
Aww, come on! Bonding with others is great and all, but that alone's not enough to do it justice!
[k]

＠Musashi
In the end, it was all about your potential!

My journey's goal?[sr]Um, that's...

...Hmm. My journey is just to perfect my skills, so there's no real goal.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
I guess if I had a goal, it's to get home to my world.[sr]And to master my bladework.
[k]

＠Musashi
My dad... Munisai's blade was about “one.” A perfected “one.” A “one” that reached heights that could never be exceeded.
[k]

＠Musashi
But I HAAATE that damn old man.[sr]So I want to surpass him no matter what it takes.
[k]

＠Musashi
So I want a sword that can exceed “one.” Before I die, I want to reach the Throne of the Void. I want to achieve “zero.”

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
...Well, you're right. It's too bad, since we got to know each other so well.
[k]

＠Musashi
I have my own world, and you have your own world of Chaldea.
[k]

＠Musashi
It's a shame, but we have to say goodbye. But if we have the chance, I'm sure we'll meet again somewhere[line 3]

...That's right. For a long, long time, I had forgotten.[sr]I had forgotten how I became an oni.
[k]

＠???
On that day, I fought with you.
[k]

＠???
After I killed those monkey-like brats in the Miyamoto village, I just happened to pass you by on the mountain road.
[k]

＠???
What a beautiful sight you were, there in the twilight. The very embodiment of evil.
[k]

＠???
I knew instantly that I had to fight you or I would have regretted it.
[k]

＠???
That's how beautiful your demeanor was.[sr]It was enough to drive me mad, had I let you go.
[k]

＠???
...And you defeated me. And now I'm finally able to remember your words you uttered at that time.
[k]

＠???
“If it's for money or honor, I'm going to run.[sr]If it's for hate or duty, I'll run then, too.”
[k]

＠???
“But...if you say your spirit can't survive unless you kill me, then I shall fight you.”
[k]

＠???
“If our lives cannot exist without killing each other, then I shall resign myself to this bloodshed.”

Indeed. So then you defeated me, and I wandered the world harboring a grudge. The next thing I knew, I had become an oni that had forgotten everything.
[k]

＠???
But...meeting you brought back my rage.[sr]I will repeat what I said then.

Sorry, [%1], can you help me out?
[k]

＠Musashi
I don't think I can slay him completely. But with you, I can let him move on to the next life. I know it's a pain, but[line 3]
[k]

？1：All right. It won't be for your sake...

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
...Yup. I knew I could count on the one who saved the world. It's impressive at your age.

[charaFace A 5]
＠Musashi
Very well, you obsessed oni.[sr]I don't know who you are.
[k]

＠Musashi
No, I don't even remember your name.[sr]You must be one of the many warriors I slew.
[k]

＠Musashi
I doubt I will remember this fight, either.[sr]But come.

＠Musashi
I am Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara-no-Harunobu! Master of the Niten Ichiryu! With my Fifth Force, I shall cut your obsession crosswise!
