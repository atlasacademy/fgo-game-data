There's something I want to tell you.[sr]It's a record from a long time ago, a tale of vengeance...

[charaFace E 4]
＠Jeanne d'Arc
A story of emotions that never faded, even if everyone forgot about them.

It is the story of a man.

Avenger seems rather angry about something.

＠B：Avenger
What you will kill this time, in the fourth Hall of Judgment, is the avatar of Wrath.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Wrath. Anger. Fury.[sr]I define these as the strongest feelings.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
It can be a private rage that exists only within oneself, or an open rage against the entire world.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
Righteous rage draws people more than anything. Sometimes they even praise the tragedies it brings.

A splendid vengeance, they call it.

＠B：Avenger
It doesn't matter who you are, or where you are.[sr]All humans love stories of revenge.
