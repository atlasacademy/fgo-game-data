It wasn't a dragon, or a boar, or a giant snake...[sr]Humph. I've never seen a monster pillar like that.

Hmm...

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
It was beautiful in its own otherworldly way.[sr]It would serve as a support pillar for my castle in the Land of Shadows.
[k]

＠Scáthach
But it's not something that should be praised too much.[sr]Besides, that's a really twisted way of naming something.

Scáthach, perhaps you[sr]already knew what that thing really was?

＠Scáthach
Once you become part of the shadow and abyss you can[sr]see the future to a certain degree, But no, I didn't know about it beforehand...
[k]

＠Scáthach
I simply saw a fragment of the future related to it.[sr]The Incineration of Humanity.

I'm not that different than you. Though...

I am a destroyer.[sr]Of both old and new civilization.

I will remove all traces of sentient beings from this[sr]planet. I will destroy all that stand in my way.

You know who she is, don't you?[sr]This Heroic spirit, whose magical energy rivals a dragon...

More than you do. As the slayer of many gods,[sr]and bearer of the knowledge of the Land of Shadows...

That's right. Indeed, Ms. Scáthach is just right![sr]But, I do like slender bodies, though...

I can feel the core of my groin tighten when I look at her![sr]She might be even a better woman than Ms. Scáthach!

Hahaha, but my intuition says[sr]what's inside her ain't quite what it looks like!

My Caladbolg is enough to delay[sr]the incarnated form of the King of Destruction!

？！

[charaFace E 1]
＠Fergus
Don't worry. It's a question of compatibility.
[k]

＠Fergus
My guess is that if I break her first,[sr]she won't be able to use her full power!

Ms. Scáthach has the job of guiding you![sr]So go!

＠Fergus
Whether it's coincidence, or inevitability I have no idea.[sr]It's probably a curse of the ancient gods...

But the true identity of my spiral sword, being a[sr]fragment of the distant, ancient gods is more than enough reason to kill you!
