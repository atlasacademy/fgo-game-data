I guess I'll hang around and help you look for food. After inviting you all out on that unsuccessful fishing trip, it's the least I can do.

It's useless asking me that question. Hunting is a knight's hobby. Especially since I am an Archer now. I will not let any prey escape me.

It would be perfect if my trustworthy horses Llamrei and Dun Stallion were here. My hound Cavall too.

[charaFace E 4]
＠Altria
Well. When your game hides in the lee of a mountain or a dense forest...
[k]

＠Altria
...then completely eradicating the surroundings would be one way to get at it, wouldn't it?
[k]

[charaFace E 6]
＠Altria
It's not something I always do, you know?[sr]...There are times when I need to, though. That's all.
[k]

＠Altria
Child of Light, am I breaking Celtic hunting etiquette in some way?
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Cú Chulainn
This goes way beyond simple etiquette![sr]No one bothered to bring it up to you?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Altria
Don't be ridiculous.[sr]Are you saying this is an absurd thing to do?
[k]

＠Altria
When Agravain came with me on hunts, he would say with his lifeless eyes, “Impressive, Your Majesty. You certainly gave it your all.”
[k]

＠Altria
Are you saying that was all just lip service?

I'll pay the hunting fees with a thrust of this spear!
