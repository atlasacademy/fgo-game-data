Looks like they're trying not to get noticed. That can only mean... they are trying to do something suspicious...

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Let's be cautious. We can follow their trail even if we lose visual. More importantly, we don't want them to find out they're being stalked.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
There must be a reason for them to be this secretive...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I don't want to know what would happen if they found out that we are...
[k]

？1：Don't scare me.
？2：We're all allies... RIGHT!?
？！

[charaFace C 5]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
You're too naive![sr]Even more naive than a baby!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I've been paying attention to see if there are any traps along the way and here you are, being naive.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Listen, Master. Don't you ever underestimate the lengths which men with a guilty conscience will go to.

Somehow I've lost sight of them. It's not like we can't track them anymore, but there's one problem...

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 1.5]

Even if there are no traps, it looks like there is a gatekeeper... You there! Isn't that right?

My name is Island Mask. I have no relationship with that refined swordsman and renowned gatekeeper.

But that getup... It's basically a sign that I can punch your face in until your mask breaks, right?

Hahaha. Only you, Lady Martha, would get that kind of impression upon seeing this mask!
[k]

＠Island Mask
Unfortunately, it's something that I borrowed, so I must ask you not to break it. And while I'm at it, I'll add that I'd rather you not punch me with those gauntlets of yours.

I see. Well then I'll aim solely for your stomach. I'll punch it so hard you won't be able to digest anything for three days. Just think of it as fasting.

So it has come to this. I suppose you are a holy maiden who educates others with an iron fist.
[k]

＠Island Mask
Well, be that as it may,[sr]a gatekeeper must perform his duty.
[k]

＠Island Mask
You may only go through once you have defeated me... That is what I am trying to say.
[k]

＠Island Mask
I am the great forest incarnate. An enigma.[sr]My existence transcends good and evil, and so forth.

＠Island Mask
In short, do not hold back on me.[sr]Come, Lady Martha, come at me!
