＠Serenity
But, I cannot. I cannot do it.
[k]


＠Serenity
I...tried to make my gift by hand.
[k]

＠Serenity
Para[line 2]I mean, a Caster told me that a handmade gift was best to convey one's feelings.
[k]

＠Serenity
I started by cultivating cacao beans, with tender...loving care...
[k]

＠Serenity
You, the one who does not die from touching me.[sr]You, who do not die from embracing me.
[k]

[charaChange A 6009002 1 fade 0.3]

＠Serenity
I have...
[k]

＠Serenity
...been searching for someone like you. Since the time I was alive. Even after I became a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Serenity
That's why...even when I get summoned as a Servant for the Holy Grail War, I...
[k]

＠Serenity
...always thought I was destined to search for a mate who would not die from touching me.
[k]

＠Serenity
My Spirit Origin has no memory of being summoned other than the hazy memory of the sixth Singularity.
[k]

＠Serenity
Even still, I will continue searching.
[k]

？1：It's all right.
？2：I won't die even when I touch you.

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Serenity
Yes. Thank you very much.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Serenity
But...I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.[sr]I[line 3]
[k]

＠Serenity
I made this with my bare hands. This chocolate.[sr]From start to finish, I used these hands of mine.
[k]

＠Serenity
I put my whole heart into this. I made it with you[line 2]the one who continues to live even after touching me[line 2]in mind.

＠Serenity
But! But, but! A liberal amount of poison has been infused within!
[k]

[charaChange A 6009002 4 fade 0.6]

＠Serenity
The toxicity is about a hundred times greater than if you touch me, and a few times more toxic than membrane contact. It's completely a lethal dose.
[k]

＠Serenity
A human will surely die.[sr]Even a Heroic Spirit would be killed.
[k]

＠Serenity
Someone who has a tolerance against poison...might...be fine...
[k]

＠Serenity
But it may not be fine.[sr]That's why...
[k]

？1：I'll be fine!
？2：It's been proven that poison types are ineffective!

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Serenity
Eh...?
[k]

＠Serenity
I-is it all...right?
[k]

＠Serenity
B-but all the poison inside...
[k]

？1：I never take my word back. Thank you.
？2：I'll savor it.

？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠Serenity
All right. I under...stand.
[k]

＠Serenity
I shall offer...my everything...the chocolate that I made...to you.
[k]

＠Serenity
Please...
[k]

＠Serenity
Eat...it. My...

Even if the great founder's evening bell rings, I will not mind.

The Spirit Origin that is me will be loyal to you.
