Do you intend to kill him even if you end up plummeting to your own death? No, you have to stop now!

My goal differs from his.

My life is fueled by my thirst for vengeance.[sr]He differs from me on a fundamental level.

＠???
Why should I lend a hand to someone who holds no grudge? That's why I rejected his offer.

＠???
True to my nature, I gave other Servants the opportunity to take revenge.

Who knows? One victory might be all that's needed for that type of guy. He might turn out to be an  unexpectedly trustworthy ally.

Really?
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Ryougi Shiki
That's right. Mash, do you know why human beings take revenge on others?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
N-No. I can't quite recall at the moment the motivation behind the act of revenge...
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
It's simple. A human being holds a grudge when they have been betrayed by someone they love. If the other person is someone they don't care about, they would be indifferent.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
So... Maybe that guy in black actually loves humanity on a fundamental level?
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
The one born from hatred speaks of love,[sr]and the one born from love speaks of hatred.

That's the type of guy he is, I'm sure.

Anyway, good work, everyone. You were all able to persevere and continue the search until the end.

There's nothing left to do now, and the distortion in the coordinates should eventually disappear.
