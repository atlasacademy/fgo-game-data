W-What's with that sigh? A duel in a blizzard[sr]should be incredibly exciting!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Caesar
Now, let me answer all your questions![sr]I'm ready!
[k]

＠Caesar
Why did I become Santa Claus?[sr]Why is Caesar so plump?
[k]

＠Caesar
What kind of beauty was Cleopatra?[sr]What's the present going to be on the last day?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Caesar
Everything! Everything! My swift tongue shall melt away all your anger and doubts!

＠Caesar
Igloo? Oh, those houses they make out of snow.[sr]I stand strong against adversity, so it's a good metaphor.
[k]

＠Caesar
But are you sure you can't wait just a little?[sr]Don't you want to know the story?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Caesar
No, you should learn the whole thing![sr]It was on a starry night, when I went to Darius' castle.
[k]

＠Caesar
He mistook me for Santa Claus, and became very happy.[sr]I had no choice but to take his things.
[k]

？1：That makes no sense!
？2：Why didn't you have a choice?

？！

[charaFace E 4]
＠Caesar
Am I supposed to tell someone who's overjoyed to see[sr]Santa that they've got the wrong guy?
[k]

＠Caesar
I could do not that, for I am Caesar.[sr]But I had no presents to give out.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Caesar
So I borrowed things from Darius.[sr]So I could use them as presents, you see.
[k]

＠Caesar
Though I did have Phantom, who just happened to be[sr]there, sign off as the buyer.
[k]

？1：Are you a demon!?
？2：What did Phantom ever do to you?

？！

[charaFace E 4]
＠Caesar
But in the end, I was just a temporary Santa Claus.[sr]I couldn't give them what they truly wanted.
[k]

＠Caesar
Unable to bear their sad crying, I crossed the river and[sr]the next thing I knew I was in France.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Caesar
There was a very pure-hearted knight. She... No, he?[sr]No, She? Anyway, I did my work there, too.
[k]

＠Caesar
I heard they wished to sell their old possessions[sr]and I bought everything they owned.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Caesar
I was fortunate to have the funds from Darius.[sr]One of their possessions was a treasure of the French Royal family.
[k]

＠Caesar
They begged me to return it,[sr]so I sold it back to them for ten times the price.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Caesar
“Are you really a famous spy, d'Eon?[sr]Maybe the enemy just lets you go because you're cute?”
[k]

＠Caesar
I couldn't bear to see the Queen bullying her like that.[sr]She was almost in tears.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Caesar
So I went to the mountains and hid, where I found[sr]an oriental beauty plotting to assassinate an Emperor.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Caesar
“This time, the Emperor shall die by my hand[line 3]”
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Caesar
Could any man not be struck by the sight of her meditating beneath that waterfall?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Caesar
Fortunately, I'm half an emperor myself. I told her[sr]I could give her good advice, and persuaded her to lend me her daggers[line 3]

＠Caesar
Humph. I'm a victim too, you know.
[k]

＠Caesar
Everywhere I go, people call me Santa Claus!
[k]

＠Caesar
I'm a general and a politician. You could say it's[sr]my job to live up to people's expectations.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Caesar
Thus, even if I knew I was fake, I had no choice[sr]but to play the role. Though I did have fun.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Caesar
By the way, do you know why they all think[sr]I'm Santa Claus? I have no idea.
[k]

？1：I mean, you look just like...
？2：Surprised you survived this far, actually.

Hahaha! That's the true Santa Claus for you!
[k]

＠Caesar
To be honest, I was getting tired of being mistaken for[sr]Santa Claus and having to run away!
[k]

？1：Then stop causing trouble!
？2：You can't live without making trouble, huh?

？！

[charaFace E 2]
＠Caesar
I'm bored, though![sr]Nero and Caligula won't play with me!
[k]

＠Caesar
And Cleopatra is avoiding me! How can I be Caesar if[sr]I don't cause trouble for all these lovey-dovey couples!
[k]

？1：So you just have a grudge against people!?

？！

[charaFace E 1]
＠Caesar
Hahahaha! I guess you found me out![sr]It's time to fight, then!
[k]

＠Caesar
If I defeat you, I will take the presents, and become the True Santa, that's fine with me!
[k]

＠Caesar
The throne of the rare Servant shall be mine![sr]Now hand it over, Dark Santa!
