Ah, I see. It's Valentine's Day.

＠Amakusa Shirou
Chocolates... This taste brings back memories.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
Valentine's Day is widely established as the day of remembrance for the martyrdom of Saint Valentinus.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
In Japan, it is a day where women hand out chocolates to men... That is widely accepted. However, that is not the case for Western cultures.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
...Actually, as you live in an age where information is literally at one's fingertips, listening to my lecture must be a bore.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
The modern Valentine's Day is a celebration where friends, bosses, subordinates, family, and lovers exchange chocolates.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
As long as it comes from the heart, it is not an issue.

＠Amakusa Shirou

You may not believe it, but everything is handmade.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
Humanity was restored, and so I need to establish a mass production line while I have the time and opportunity.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
I am, of course, talking about raising funds for Chaldea. There is nothing else to it.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
Well, either way, they are all delicious. Please have one.
