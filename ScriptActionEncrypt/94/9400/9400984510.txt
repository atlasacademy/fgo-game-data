Valentine's Day chocolates... I see.

＠Gilles de Rais
To gift them to a geezer like me is quite humbling.

This is a magazine from the Jeanne Fan Club.
[k]

？1：Jeanne...fan club?
？！


＠Gilles de Rais
Yes. Not only does it cover the Normal Saint, White Saint, Black Saint, Little Saint, and High School Girl Saint Jeanne, but also the Yellow version that manifested that one time.
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
It's the most perfect and complete fanzine! Details about Jeanne's childhood, how she came to her ultimate fate, her most loved and hated foods...
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
Intimate details about her daily schedule, what she does... This gem of a magazine covers it ALL!

Sir Blackbeard DID make a questionable comment, saying, “The book is too thin. Is it really any good?” Anyway, this magazine was made with the love of true fans, and in the end,

＠Gilles de Rais
who managed to talk Jeanne into wearing a swimsuit, since Jeanne lamented that she couldn't go to the sea last year even though she had a swimsuit ready...
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
so they were able to get that miraculous shot! And then, the Little Saint said, “Am I going to look like that when I grow up!? Really!? Yes!” And so this magazine that received the highest prais[line 3]
