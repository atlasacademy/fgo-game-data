My name is Nursery Rhyme![sr]Nice to meet you!

[charaFace D 1]

Have some tea[line 2]freshly brewed the day before last. Which would you prefer, marmalade or lemon?
[k]

Mm, yes, she's definitely a Servant. Although it seems she is not the owner of the giant Reality Marble.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But at the same time, she's apparently also a Master. I suppose that's only natural, given her ability to control such magical beings.

If she's a Caster-class, this is worth investigating.[sr]As such, be very careful!
