＠Scáthach
This doesn't look like the work of a demon boar. The piglets may have made them for protection...either for themselves or for others.
[k]

＠Scáthach
At any rate, it seems their creations weren't enough to[sr][charaFace B 4]defeat the demon boars.

And there were automata lying on the ground besides the ones we defeated.

They felt powerful enough to me just now...
[k]

＠Marie
If nothing else, they seem stronger than the demon boars we fought.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Scáthach
...Which means the latter are just small fry compared to something else on this island.
[k]

It's probably just up ahead.[sr]Let's move, Master.

I can't imagine giant demon boars like the one we saw on the previous island would simply show up, however...
[k]

＠Scáthach
If we don't deal with them, they will quickly grow in power.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Scáthach
It's possible we might see multiple fortress-class enemies.

Fortress-class demon boars... Just as strong as Clan Calatin, or even... Hehehehehe.

I'll show you later when this is over.

There's probably something waiting for us up ahead. When you see it, you'll understand whether you want to or not.

Sort of.[sr]But it doesn't really affect our situation.
