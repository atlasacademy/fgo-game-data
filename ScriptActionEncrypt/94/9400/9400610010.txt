＠　
...What is civilization? I suppose you would call it the path every sentient being travels.
[k]

＠　
Every single building, every single dish of food... It all contains a vast amount of our ancestors' knowledge.
[k]

＠　
In that case, this landscape of destruction represents the end of said path.
[k]

＠　
The extravagant buildings, the entertainment, the technology infused within glorious inventions...
[k]

＠　
None of that can be found here.[sr]A 2,000-year-old obsession crushed them all.
[k]

＠　
We have no hope.
[k]

＠　
We have no heroes, no brave warriors. We have no way to defeat them because the idea of fighting never even occurred to us.
[k]

＠　
So all we can do is pray.
[k]

＠　
Pray that the Nine Sisters, the goddesses who taught us of civilization and loyalty, visit this world someday.
[k]
