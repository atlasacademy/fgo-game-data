＠Sakata Kintoki
...Good thing I changed into my Rider class. Right now I'm the wind. Y'know, some might even say the wind is me.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Yeah, I just gotta be the wind.[sr]If I'm gonna deal with this catastrophe, I got no choice.
[k]

？1：Kintoki?

Valentine's Day. I thought it was just some cutesy holiday from the West...
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Sakata Kintoki
But lo and behold! It's freakin' horrible![sr]It's an evil day!

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sakata Kintoki
We're in this together now.[sr]It's sorta like both our lives are at risk!
[k]

？1：I don't understand what you're talking about.

＠Sakata Kintoki
What, you don't get it? That brat Shuten and Boss Raikou showed up this afternoon...
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
And they all of a sudden jumped me! I thought I was a goner! I'll freakin' die before I take those chocolate things!
[k]

？2：This is about Shuten-Douji and Raikou, isn't it?

＠Sakata Kintoki
Boss, you're as sharp as ever. Exactly. That brat Shuten and Boss Raikou showed up this afternoon...
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
And they all of a sudden jumped me! I thought I was a goner! I'll freakin' die before I take those chocolate things!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Shuten being awful is normal, but Boss Raikou seems to have a screw loose or somethin' today.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
The moment I said, “I don't want that. I'm no kid.”
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I was half a step away from wakin' up Ushi Gozen.[sr]Gave me a “Sakata-must-die” look, that kinda situation.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Ya get it? No?[wt 0.3][charaFace A 0][sr]Come on, just read the room!
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Anyway, Boss. Just promise me you'll never do somethin' dumb like refusin' their offering!

＠Sakata Kintoki
It's a replica of my prized Rider Belt!
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I know you're human, so no matter how much you try, your Spirit Origin ain't gonna change.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
But it's still a customized item. The nerdy Servants are always tryin' to get their mitts on it.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sakata Kintoki
It's one of my favorite things, even among all my other favorites!
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I was gonna display it like a trophy, but I kinda like you havin' it.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Yeah. You're the special one who can duke it out in tandem with me, so I've got no problem givin' it to ya.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Well, do as you want with it, Boss!
