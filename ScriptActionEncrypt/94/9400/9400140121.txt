A tenacity that ignores the Class affinity...[sr]Our fates are truly intertwined.
[k]

＠Lancer
...But that is all for now.[sr]We must each again inquire of the Bhagavad-Gita.
[k]
＠Lancer
We can continue this after that is finished. ...the Master[sr]over there, and the one who watched over that Master.
[k]

＠Lancer
...I know it may be a burden to you, but I want you to guide him. You're the only ones who can do it.
[k]

？1：Do you need guidance as well?

＠Lancer
...It's unnecessary.[sr]But I do appreciate the offer.
[k]

＠Lancer
As long as that man is present, I will be your enemy.
[k]

＠Lancer
The same is true if reversed as well.
[k]

＠Lancer
A hated enemy is a necessary ingredient of myth.[sr]I am truly used to playing that part.
[k]

？2：But for what purpose?

＠Lancer
I have no obligation to answer my enemies.[sr]What I am after is insignificant.
[k]

＠Archer
Master, a while ago I said that I had tired of living.
[k]

＠Archer
That is the sincere truth.[sr]My thirst for battle has also faded.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Archer
However...[sr]even so...
[k]

＠Archer
I cannot abide that Lancer.[sr]I know this feeling I have is unreasonable...
[k]

＠Archer
That man is most certainly a righteous person.
[k]

＠Archer
He is recognized by the people and is a hero who devotes himself to doing virtuous deeds.
[k]

＠Archer
But still, I truly, for some reason, want to battle him.
[k]

＠Archer
No, it's not a desire to battle.[sr]I want to deny him. Deny all of him. Everything.
[k]

＠Archer
...I am certain this is an unforgivable request.[sr]This is an improper desire.
[k]

？1：It is not improper.

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Archer
Not improper? What do you mean?
[k]

？1：Most certainly he is your mortal enemy.

＠Archer
My mortal...enemy.
[k]

＠Archer
...[sr]...
[k]

＠Archer
I see.[sr]Those words have hit home.
[k]


？2：Then you should go on a quest for that answer.

＠Archer
Go on a...quest?
[k]

＠Archer
...[sr]...
[k]

＠Archer
You may be right.[sr]To find out who the man is that boils my blood...
[k]

＠Archer
...and to find out who I am.[sr]I should search for those answers.
[k]

...It seems the storm has passed as well, as if waking from a dream.

＠Archer
I am ever a wanderer.
[k]

＠Archer
If we meet again in reality, I would be glad if we could find those answers together.
[k]

＠Archer
[line 2]Farewell, my Master.[sr]I look forward to the day that we may meet again.
