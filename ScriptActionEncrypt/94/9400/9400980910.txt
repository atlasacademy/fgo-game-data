...It's a quiet night.[sr]Hey, where are all the other Servants?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Well, just the the two of us going on a hunt isn't bad once in a while. I'll accompany you whether it's hunting for Embers or whatever.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Or is it something else?[sr]You got something to tell me?
[k]

？1：Well, it's Valentine's Day.
？2：Here's some chocolates. I hope you like them.

Oh hey. These are the things that the bratty Servants at Chaldea eat sometimes.

＠Cú Chulainn
...I get it now. So it's called Valentine's Day?[sr]I thought the people around me were cheery lately.

＠Cú Chulainn
They're for me? There's plenty of others hanging out at the cafeteria who would want these.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Whatever. It may not fill up my stomach, but if you're giving it to me, I'll take it.

Master. Sorry, I don't have anything on me.[sr]Don't expect anything big.
[k]

？1：I didn't give it to you because I wanted something back.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
Haha, that's a relief.[sr]Then I'll gladly accept.
[k]

？2：Your sentiments are enough.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
What an admirable thing to say.[sr]But I wouldn't want to be seen as stingy.

Not everyone has done it, but some of us Heroic Spirits have been through a Holy Grail War.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
And while it doesn't happen with everyone, some of us have retained our memories of the experience.

＠Cú Chulainn
...And I happen to be one that did.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
I don't know about the aged me or the Caster me, but I once fought in a Holy Grail War. There was a lot of killing.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
That was the time when my Noble Phantasm was sealed. As you know, its power is incredible. And its notoriety too.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
That's why my Master at that time chose to seal away the Noble Phantasm. It was set aside as an ace in the hole.
[k]

？1：So this lance is...

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Cú Chulainn
Even without a Noble Phantasm, there's no avoiding battle. Obviously, you'd need a weapon for when it comes.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
A different Gáe Bolg. It was the spear that the Master I had back then made rather hastily.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
It's pretty far off from the real Gáe Bolg, but it's still a good lance.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Somehow, I've still been using it.[sr]You could also say it's one of my favorite lances.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Besides, I wouldn't care if it got destroyed from rough use, and by not worrying about that, I can go all-out!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
It may be useless to you, but take it.[sr]I have plenty of replacements.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
It's a good weapon.[sr]It won't break even against a Sphinx's hide.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
...Though it'll break like a twig if it's up against a certain sacred sword.
