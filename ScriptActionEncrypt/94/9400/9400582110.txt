I caught the bird we mentioned earlier.[sr]What do you think, Master?
[k]


？1：It's cute.
？2：It's like...a fluffy duck.

＠Anne
It's slow and it doesn't fly. It's pretty cute.
[k]

＠Mary
It lays its eggs in a place that's easy to access, and its meat is delicious.
[k]

＠Mary
...It's much better than those birds we were forced to catch and eat at sea.

I'm just speaking from memory, so I may be wrong, but...

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Isn't this bird a dodo...?
[k]


？1：Aren't those...extinct?
？2：I've heard of them.
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes. The dodo was discovered in the 16th century, but due to overhunting, it went extinct in less than 100 years.
[k]

＠Mash
Since it couldn't fly, it had no way to protect itself from its enemies...

？1：Mash, that's just a rare bird. Got it?


[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
R-Right. Let's... just leave it at that.
[k]


？2：If we just breed more, there should be no problem!

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
R-Right![sr]This is a ranch, so we need to increase their numbers!
[k]

＠Mash
I feel like an unexpected sense of responsibility has befallen us...
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
There will be more if they give birth, and there will be less if we eat them. I know that is common sense, but it is quite difficult to manage living creatures.

＠Mash
Senpai, let's try not to overdo things...
