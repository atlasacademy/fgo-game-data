I'm disappointed. My one chance to slash an opponent from the stars. Next time, I'll start by cutting off that strain of hair on her head.

？1：That's basically telling X to die.

[charaFace G 1]
＠G：Ryougi Shiki
Yes. That is what I meant.
[k]

？2：So is Shiki going to grow one as well?

[charaFace G 3]
＠G：Ryougi Shiki
Really? In that case... I guess it wouldn't be a good idea to cut that off, right?
[k]

You heard her. Good job helping to remove the Servants, Senpai.

We still have time, so why don't we search this building a little more?
