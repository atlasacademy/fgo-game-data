Tch. Well, it was only a matter of time until they found out about this place...

Th-This is...!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
This place...
[k]

？1：There are buildings...?
？2：And a crop field...?
？！

[charaFace D 7]
＠Mash
That's right, Master. It's on a smaller scale... but it looks just like our village.

They got buildings and even a crop field. Although the direction they went in is slightly different than ours.

Hmm... Hmmmmm... This place is more organized than I thought. Some structures are even built better than ours...

But why would you hide this place?

[charaFadein B 0.1 1]

＠Cú Chulainn
It has to be hidden.[sr]You see, boys do like their little secret bases, right?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Although the place you guys got there is getting a lot more convenient than here.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Either way, Diarmuid, Fionn, and I talked about how building a village with our own hands would also serve as good training.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
And so, even with those guys gone, we've decided to continue building this place in secret.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Cú Chulainn
How should I put it... Fionn said it best...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
It makes us feel nervous when there are girls in swimsuits around all the time.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Uncle Fergus, on the other hand, would've loved that place. He'd do as he pleased, without a care in the world.
[k]


？1：I see... Does this village have a name?
？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
Hmm? Well, it's...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
Both Fionn and Diarmuid entrusted their[sr]dying wish to us.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
In order to honor the noble Lancers who built this place, we call it... “Backspear Village.”

Heh heh. I am just a farmer with a hoe, a support member if you will.
[k]

？1：...So a spin on your boy band name.
？！

＠Cú Chulainn
Hahaha, that's a funny joke you got there.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Still, if even the ever-calm Karna would go wild with the base, we might be able to create some good tunes there.

I will shred the bassline like a wild beast[line 2]whatever that means[line 2]and tear into my Master's enemies.

＠Cú Chulainn
It's just a joke. Well, I'm sure there's a version of me who's in a band somewhere.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
But that's a different me,[sr]and a different Backspear Boys.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
We are the summer edition of Backspear, and we'll be burning up the charts all summer long!

I feel like Cú Chulainn is just blurting nonsense right now.

＠Mash
All I got is that the men here are really enjoying themselves.

[charaFace D 13]
＠Mash
This place is their haven, their paradise.[sr]Let's leave it alone for now.
