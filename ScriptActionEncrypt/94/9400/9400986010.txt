[f large]What!?
[k]

＠Arjuna
Choco...lates...?[sr]For me...?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Arjuna
A boon that is not a blessing from a god or a mentor, but simply a kind gesture from Master...?
[k]

＠Arjuna
How could this be...?[sr]Master, please hear me out.
[k]

＠Arjuna
Am I worthy of receiving such a gift from you!?
[k]

＠Arjuna
It is true[line 2]and I am certainly aware[line 2]that I am superior to the other Servants.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Arjuna
On the other hand, though...I have only assisted you as a mere Servant and nothing more.
[k]

＠Arjuna
That is what I think.
[k]

＠Arjuna
A true Servant would be a partner to you, and lead you down a good path...!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Arjuna
Yet regardless, you give me chocolates with beloved affection... Then I have no choice but to resolve myself.
[k]

＠Arjuna
I must repay you with something that is worthy of and equal to your gift.

＠Arjuna
My lifelong, detested nemesis...and the one of whom I am most jealous...the hero, Karna.
[k]

＠Arjuna
This is the arrow that killed him.
[k]

？1：!?
？！

＠Arjuna
As I have received your trust and respect, what I have to offer in return is my everything.
[k]

＠Arjuna
...Yes, this arrow represents my shameful past, my grudge...and yet it is something that I must face and reflect on.
[k]

＠Arjuna
By having you hold on to this arrow...you will have and know my everything.
[k]

＠Arjuna
And I shall also swear...that I will never shoot a cowardly arrow like this one ever again.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Arjuna
And so, with all of that sentiment endowed upon this gift, I give it to you. Please accept it.
