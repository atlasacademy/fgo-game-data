＠Amakusa Shirou
Both Jeanne d'Arc and I fought for the same reason. ...Am I right, Holy Maiden?
[k]

＠Jeanne d'Arc
Yes... But once again I wasn't strong enough[line 3]
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
Vengeance is not man's to perform.[sr]One does not need to refer to scripture to know this.

＠Amakusa Shirou
This is neither a prediction nor a prophecy,[sr]but a statement from me to you, Avenger.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Amakusa Shirou
Those black flames will someday destroy you as well.

Even God himself cannot change my state as an eternal Avenger. Do you speak, knowing that?

Weak. Weak. What weakness![sr]I cannot even bring myself to laugh!
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Know that weakness is what trapped you here as avatars of Wrath and Greed!

＠B：Avenger
If you had manifested in your true forms, you would not have been so easily...

No, I won't say it. We'll meet again in another hell.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
You who do not lose your nobility, even here.[sr]I mock your God, but I do not mock you.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
You, Holy Maiden who forgives all without Wrath. And you, Saint of Greed, who stands against an evil world.

＠B：Avenger
Only one Hall of Judgment remains.[sr]Perhaps you shall return alive after all.

If you never give up, and you keep killing and pressing on, that is.

Their interest was in me. If they'd gotten what they wanted, what would've happened to you?

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
Perhaps you would've been saved.[sr]Perhaps you would have been trapped here forever.

There's no way to tell now, though![sr]Whichever it was, you can do nothing but believe me!
