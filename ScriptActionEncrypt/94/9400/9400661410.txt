Adult women... They're so strong-willed!
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Diarmuid
They're so cunning, and they don't show their true sides! They expect to be protected, yet they plot to dominate behind the scenes!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Diarmuid
On the other hand, magical girls are physically strong. They don't complain about trivial things like their feet hurting from walking and so on!

There are even structural differences in their hearts![sr]And I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said the color of their souls is different too...

＠Diarmuid
Oh, the beauty of magical girls who have a sense of duty and battle dauntlessly! Ugh. [charaFace E 4]In contrast, adult women...

＠Diarmuid
One minute it's “My computer is broken, so fix it,” but before you know it, they start sulking because I'M the one with the bad attitude...

But maybe the wounded puppy thing isn't so bad.[sr]I just want to wrap my arms around him.

I cannot attain magical girlhood, but I can fulfil my knightly duties and present them with a tiara.
