＠Sanzang
In order to extinguish the wild flames of the Flaming Mountains and get to Tianzhu, we definitely need the “Banana Leaf Fan.”
[k]

＠Sanzang
And Princess Iron Fan, the one who resides in the Banana Leaf Cave, is the wielder of said fan.

＠Zhu Bajie
A world-renowned beauty, also known as the Demonic Lady, a Rakshesa. I wonder what kind of beautiful madam she is?
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Zhu Bajie
Yeah, an older married woman doesn't sound bad. Anyway, a beautiful lady is beautiful even if she is someone else's wife.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Sanzang
Hey you! Don't get excited about the “someone else's wife” part. Keep it to yourself!

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanzang
Anyway, it's impossible to predict what kind of people we'll meet on this journey...
[k]

？1：Based on what Mo Boy said, I can take a guess...

Correction. You will address me as “Mother,” or else I will cut that infected tongue out.

Sorry, Mom! Please don't cut my tongue off!
[k]

＠F：???
I will tolerate staying out overnight without permission... but did you wash your hands when you got home?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Red Boy
I did! Very thoroughly for about five seconds![sr]Then dried them with the Banana Leaf Fan!
[k]

＠F：???
That explains the mess in the bathroom. What happens if those germs get spread around the castle?
[k]

＠F：???
I've told you to carry disposable towels with you so many times... Hmmm? Did you rinse your mouth after returning home?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Red Boy
Of course! For about three seconds while drinking cola!
[k]

＠Red Boy
Hear my beautiful voice. We have a similar voice, right? Genetically mother and child!

＠F：???
...Red Boy. What's that scratch on your cheek?

(Gasp)

Just a scratch! It's nothing![sr]Just put some saliva on it and[line 3]
[k]

＠F：???
[line 3]It seems I need to teach you a lesson.[sr]To the medical room. I will treat you myself.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]

＠Red Boy
Ahhhhhh, I'm sorry, Mom!
[k]

＠Red Boy
I don't wanna wash my face in a bucket of peroxide again!

There have been no reports of anyone falling ill around the Flaming Mountains.
[k]

＠Princess Iron Fan
Those flames must have strong anti-bacterial effects.
[k]


？1：But no one is alive either!
？2：Oh, come on!

？！

＠Princess Iron Fan
I am quite offended that you would criticize my charity work.
[k]

＠Princess Iron Fan
There are many uses for the Banana Leaf Fan.
[k]

＠Princess Iron Fan
However, I cannot lend it to you for a trivial reason like extinguishing a mountain fire.
[k]


？1：...By the way, where is the Ox-Demon King?
？！

＠Princess Iron Fan
Ox-Demon King... My partner is not here in this castle. He must be wandering about...

Even Red Boy is following his bad example...[sr]My patience is just about running out.

My principle of education is perfect![sr]I even allow my son independence!

I'm always furious... at this unsanitary world... at the fact that accursed disease runs rampant everywhere.

Yes! Travelers like you are especially beyond help!

[charaFace F 6]

Greedy for repletion, knowledge, and pleasure; living as you desire. You would dig up buried relics and wake dormant indigenous diseases.

The chef with the red cape said, “the pig is a very useful domestic animal. The only part you can't use is its scream.”
