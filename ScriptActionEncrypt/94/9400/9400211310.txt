I know what you're trying to say, Senpai, but that's not the same thing. Also, I heard rappers are a thing of the past!

Still... I can't believe we're seeing Cú Chulainn here, Senpai.

Like Leonidas, I don't think he's a Heroic Spirit that should be here in this apartment.

There. I was suffocating under that hood.[sr]Also far too formal when I am gambling.

＠Cú Chulainn
So sit, honored guests.[sr]Which game do you desire?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Cards? Dice? Roulette?[sr]Or a rousing game of backgammon?

Well, typical apartment gambling.[sr]No problem. That's a matter that requires an arrest.

I'm afraid so. I had too much free time, so my hobby became extreme and I began running a casino☆
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
I mean, I am Caster class, after all. When I hold this staff, manipulating the dice is just too easy...

＠Cú Chulainn
Ah... Oh, that? To be honest, that was the cause...
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

It is not as if I settled here of my own volition. I got into a quarrel with my mentor.

＠Cú Chulainn
I can't leave just yet. When I told her, “Act your age,” I was hit with the full force of her fury.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
I tell you, I haven't mixed it up with my mentor like that since I was her disciple in the Land of Shadows!
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
There was also Fergus, Ferdia, and I believe 20 others.[sr]My mentor announced it out of the blue. As a final test.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
“All of you, slay me right now. If you cannot, you will die.[sr]For I am going to slaughter the lot of you.”
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
That's what she said. I suppose it was to weed out the weaker warriors, but I wish she hadn't been that serious.
[k]

？1：Tell me about it. I hate her Stun.

[charaFace F 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
Oh, you've fought her before somewhere?! What a misfortune!
[k]

？2：So, did you win then?

[charaFace F 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
If we hadn't, neither Uncle Fergus, Ferdia nor I would have been around to become Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
It took all of us.[sr]Normally, she would have beaten us.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
But the thing is, afterwards...[sr]She easily wiped us out...
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Don't tell anyone I told you this, understand?[sr]That woman hides one side of her true character.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
“You have done well. You fools have finally become half-fledged warriors. But... I still have one stage of transformation left.”
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
That's what she said before sending us flying.[sr]I'm telling you, we were like scraps of paper.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Cú Chulainn
...And this time was like a reenactment of that.[sr]She laid waste to my Wicker Man.
[k]

？！

[charaFace F 4]
＠Cú Chulainn
Long story short, I lost to my mentor and was imprisoned here.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
She told me to think about what I did for a while. Treating me like the monkey in that story...

You mean China's famous story of the Five Elements Mountain, with the Monkey King?
[k]

＠Mash
I sympathize with your situation,[sr]Cú Chulainn, but I think you're also to blame.
[k]

＠Mash
You should never casually bring up a woman's age. Especially if she cares about what people think of her.

What do you say we set aside the gambling and turn to another pursuit? My bedroom door is wide open to young beauties!
