I must commend you for your efforts. You traveled all the way from Tang, even crossing the Flaming Mountains...

＠Ox-Demon King
O eminent Tang Monk, Xuanzang Sanzang[line 3][sr]This is the scripture that has been entrusted to me.
[k]

＠Ox-Demon King
And this is the other scripture Nezha gave me when she visited this castle earlier.
[k]

？1：Nezha did that?
？！

＠Ox-Demon King
You may have both of these scriptures.[sr]It is the Buddha's will.
[k]

＠Ox-Demon King
[line3]Meaning, your journey ends here.

[charaFace E 4]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]

＠Ox-Demon King
I said it's the Buddha's will.[sr]You now have all six scriptures.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Ox-Demon King
[line 3]The Buddha gave me a mission.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Ox-Demon King
The Buddha said he sealed your memory of the realization of the transient nature of the five desires into the scriptures scattered along the trip.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Ox-Demon King
The five desires are sights, sounds, scents, tastes, and tactility.
[k]

＠Ox-Demon King
In other words, the attachment that arises from contact with the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Ox-Demon King
This kind of explanation probably sounds unnecessary to you, though, right?
[k]

？1：One, two, three, four, five... What's the last one?
？！

[charaFace E 0]
＠Ox-Demon King
The last of the six scriptures is “meaning.”[sr]The attachment produced by the heart.
[k]

＠Ox-Demon King
Ending your journey here and being satisfied from the bottom of your heart will recover the enlightenment you lost[line 3]!

Your apprentices will continue on to Tianzhu.[sr]That will bring them back to the world they belong to.

[k]

＠Sanzang
I haven't accomplished anything![sr]I appreciate the scriptures, but that's not it!

I'm not ready to recite them correctly.[sr]I'm not there yet!

How unreasonable you are...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Ox-Demon King
The scriptures of the Buddha possess an inherent value to the common folk. They do not care who is reciting them[line3]
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Ox-Demon King
If you cannot realize that, you sure are far from enlightenment.

Returning to the Throne of Heroes means we will disappear. Chaldea is an exception, but we can't return there quite yet.

There is a place I want to go back to.[sr]But I'll just fight, have fun, and die, though.
