Oh, man. I think I might've made something insanely awesome!
[k]

＠Mordred
Not only do I have aptitude as a king, but as an artist too! Man, I really am the best! I'm awesome!

Such passionate self-praise.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
We built it exactly according to Mordred's design...
[k]

＠Mash
It is meant to be in the style of the Tower of Babel.[sr]I'm not sure why it purposefully looks like it's broken partway up?
[k]


？1：It...It's so freaking cool!

？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠Mordred
You can clearly see it overflows with rebellious spirit![sr]It's the perfect symbol of mankind's mutinous heart!
[k]

＠Mordred
This is a tower truly fit for me!

Wha-What!? Th-This tower! It is blasphemous![sr]Most blasphemous!
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Martha
Hmm? But... I suppose it's acceptable if it is meant to represent an act of divine will...

U-Um, Martha...I think it's safe to say there's not even a smidge of a connection to anything pious here... So don't bother trying to find one...

(Hmm... Although it was my first time building a tower that can withstand actual use while appearing broken...)
[k]

＠Scáthach
(...Since it hasn't crumbled yet,[sr]it seems it turned out well.)

(I'm quite a good craftsman, if I do say so myself.[sr]Heh, heh...)
