The festival of Valentine's Day is wonderful! I welcome anything that would help us deepen our friendship!

＠Musashi
Anyway! Now you know... So here you go!
[k]

＠Musashi
This is a token of my gratitude for always hanging out with me with proper manners...without being disgusted by my roughneck ways.

＠Musashi
Yep. Right. Dumplings.[sr]I don't know jack about chocolates.
[k]

＠Musashi
Yes. Udon. Soba noodles are good, but udon is the way to go for hot noodles!
[k]

＠Musashi
You can learn so many things from udon. Like how far to extend your sword, how to be tenacious, be elastic...also savory...
[k]

＠Musashi
So if you want to get strong, you should eat more rice, fish, and udon!
[k]

＠Musashi
Oh, I know! Let's find some time to make udon noodles next! Yep! I'll teach you everything!
[k]

＠Musashi
I only organized my own stuff, so you don't have to worry about a thing.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Musashi
I fight for others all the time, but I never budgeted my money for someone else before...
[k]

＠Musashi
I wasn't sure that I could pull it off, or that it wouldn't be a bother.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Musashi
But I'm suuuper happy to see you enjoy it! I'm glad I staked everything I got! I'm glad I risked going into battle!
[k]

＠Musashi
The dumplings are delicious, and your smile is the best! Let's come again, my Master!
