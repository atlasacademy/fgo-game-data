He's not a mage who poses any threat alone, but...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
He is a murderer who will continue these acts on his own, even without Caster. He must be dealt with.

＠Kayneth
But Caster himself has been defeated.[sr]Haven't we done what the Overseer asked?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Indeed. Go to the Fuyuki Church and request your additional Command Spell. We'll clean things up here.
