I don't dwell on the past... So even if we were friends...

[charaFace G 1]

Why don't we forget about it and focus on the present? It's easier to forget the bad things that happened in the past, right?

I think we can resolve this by talking, like magical girls are supposed to!

Talking? That's a wonderful idea.

＠Medea Lily
If you could take an opponent's life just through conversation, that's better than fighting.

[charaFace G 1]
＠Medea Lily
That's how you obtained that jewel, isn't it?[sr]That jewel covered in the blood of its former owner?

＠Medea Lily
Which kingdom's magical girl did you kill?[sr]I'm sure it was a very difficult fight.

Would you tell me how you did it?[sr]I'd like to know... just for reference, of course.

And now you've come to take my jewel.[sr]Hehe. How energetic and strong-minded you are!

[charaFace G 5]
＠Medea Lily
As a magical girl, you're not someone I can welcome, but as a queen, you're not someone I can ignore either!

＠Medea Lily
Am I right, Lord Jason?[sr]They say they're gathering jewels.

I would like to praise you for your bravery and recklessness. Everyone, would you come to my castle?
[k]

＠Medea Lily
Tell me of your travels on the way. It's been centuries since I've been able to talk to a magical girl!
