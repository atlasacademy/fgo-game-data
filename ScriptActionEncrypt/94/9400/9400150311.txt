＠Nero
Well, if it isn't [%1] and Mash.[sr]Umu. I am very pleased to see you again.
[k]

＠Nero
By the way, is this the first time I've met you as a Servant? Or have we already met before?
[k]

＠Nero
If this is the first time, then I need to introduce myself!
[k]

＠Nero
I am Nero Claudius, in my new Servant form!
[k]

＠Nero
May our friendship be long, [%1].[sr]It is nice to know you, Master.

Well. You are very kind. It has been quite a while, Mash and [%1].
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
You need not trouble yourselves over us.[sr]As you can see, we have accompanied Red Saber here.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
We just thought we'd tag along.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Actually, we heard that there was a versatile appliance here that could cook and do laundry, which would be very useful for newlyweds, but...
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
It's clear as day that there is no such thing on that rocket!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I will have nothing to do with such junk! Those ads were utter lies! This is going too far!

At any rate, I have assessed your situation, Lily.[sr]The manner in which you handle your blade is quite admirable.
[k]

＠Nero
Yet, allow me to assist you. If you need a fencing partner, then I am better than a hundred, nay, ten thousand partners!

Hey! What are we suddenly getting along so harmoniously for? I defeated you just now, Saber!
[k]

＠X
You should resign and withdraw from the field![sr]And you, Lily! You are far too lenient!
[k]

＠X
All Sabers besides you are enemies[line 3] Until you embrace that, you can only dream of becoming a full-fledged Saber!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Nero
We merely pulled our punches just now because we realized our opponents were Mash and [%1].
[k]

＠Nero
But who in the world are you?[sr]The owner of this rocket? ...Umu...
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Nero
I feel like... I've seen you somewhere...[sr]It's like...looking at a mirror...
[k]

＠Nero
I have a feeling that I know you...[sr]Who are you? Where are you from?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠X
Hmph, I have no obligation to tell the Red One my name, but I guess I have no choice here.
[k]

＠X
I am Heroine X. I am an envoy of justice from the future, come here to correct you Sabers.

I'm sorry, my apologies. I just sensed that this world was through, so I couldn't help it. But really, you two, you shouldn't fight.
[k]

＠Emiya
I do not know what your burden is, Lady X... It appears to me that the most important thing is to repair your spacecraft.
[k]

＠Emiya
And Miss Lily, aren't you in training? Or is it possible that this is somehow connected with your objective?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠X
...Hmm... That's right.[sr]Even though you're with that Red one, you are sharp.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Emiya
Uh, well. To avoid any more misunderstandings, I do not recall ever becoming this Saber's ally. I am entirely neutral.
[k]

＠Emiya
And Miss Lily, allow me to assist in your training.
[k]

＠Emiya
Naturally, I do not have a lot of time.[sr]But seeing how things are, I cannot help myself.

Fine. I've predicted the monsters gathering here will only get stronger from now on.
[k]

I'm sure Lily will feel more assured with you at her side.[sr]Red One, I will allow your presence for now.

Hmph! I thought you were a twisted one, but I see that you're good at heart. I will go along with your policy.

Sorry I was just a minor role!

I was concerned about Mo-san, and didn't want to take the lead role from her! She's pretty good, you know!
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Well, it's true I never had a chance to take part.[sr]That's all right. I do have my own main story, after all.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
When we get to the Japan stage, Ushiwakamaru, the others, and I will have a great battle with the Japanese Servants.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
For now, I trust that time will come and will conserve my energy. [line 3]Therefore, I shall stay behind the scenes.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
That rocket, or whatever it is, looks as if it has AC inside.[sr]I think I'll take a nice break♡
