＠Scáthach
This is the place I'm supposed to protect. In other words, it's the Land of Shadows, a part of the Isle of Skye.
[k]

＠Scáthach
The Land of Shadows was caught up in the incineration of humanity as well, but for some reason, this island was cut off from that.
[k]

＠Scáthach
What was it that brought those creatures here, and led them to build a civilization?
[k]

＠Scáthach
What miracle was it that brought us here?
[k]

＠Scáthach
This island is cut off from the rest of humanity. Never again will lost adventurers wind up here. We'll be the last.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Will it become a paradise? Or will it revert to its true nature, the Land of Shadows, where death and darkness rule?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Scáthach
...I suppose it'll all be okay if it's those easygoing boar piglets we're talking about. If it were humans living here, though, that'd be a different story.
[k]

＠Scáthach
After all, the piglets never developed any weapons[line 2]regardless of how advanced their civilization became.
[k]

＠Scáthach
As long as there are no foreign invaders lying in wait,[sr]I'm sure they'll live in peace.
[k]

＠Scáthach
...Don't tell the others, but just in case, I left an Oblivion Rune down there on the island.
[k]

＠Scáthach
The boar piglets will someday forget their civilization, forget their language, and live an easy life as wild beasts.
[k]


？1：Will they really be okay?

＠Scáthach
...One can only hope.[sr]That's something even I don't know the answer to.
[k]

？2：Fingers crossed...

＠Scáthach
If that's the way you feel, Master, then pray.[sr]Your prayers will surely be heard.
