The power of the feelings from Blackbeard and the others is gone. It supported me well up to now. I must be grateful for that...

You are guests.
[k]

＠Testament
You were summoned to this world both as spectators to a magical girl's exploits and as demons.

When my influence disappears, the alterations to this Reality Marble will also be undone.

This world will return to the peaceful resting place of magical girls, managed by Helena.

[charaFace D 4]

When that happens, you will be shot out.

But you'll be able to return safely to Chaldea.[sr]So rest assured.

If there is a magical girl who has reached perfection, like one that they were seeking, I wonder who will understand her misery...

Who will save that girl?

Who will show magic to a magical girl...?

You think so? I'm sure that was all calculated, too.

Although maybe that was better than leaving us with a parting shot like, [charaFace B 5]“There will be a second and third magical girl waiting for you!”

？1：Be it magic or miracles, there's always equivalent exchange.

[charaFace B 4]

That... may be right.
