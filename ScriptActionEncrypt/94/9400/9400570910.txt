＠Scáthach
Humans made their lives easier with the invention of streets. What would come next?

＠Scáthach
I shall ask you, [%1], on behalf of humankind. Answer my question.
[k]


？1：I think they would want even more convenience!
？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Scáthach
Exactly. Some say that it is pitiable, while some say that humans continuously test themselves for an easier life. It's tough to judge...

＠Mash
So, the next is a watercourse.
[k]

＠Mash
My plan is to make it easier to secure fresh water by building a channel to bring water directly into the water storage facility.

＠Kiyohime
No objection. Wood would give it a nice, gentle feel.[sr]I'd like that.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
If we build a simple waterwheel with wood scraps,[sr]I'm sure it will help us in different ways too.

But wouldn't a stone channel be sturdier?[sr]I think it'll look more stylish, too.

＠Mordred
Wait a sec. I'm sure there's something... There's definitely something more awesome we could build using Scáthach's skills, you know?
[k]

＠Mordred
So, I suggest building a pipeline.[sr]Don't you think it'll be stylish and super cool?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Mordred
Because, man, everything you guys suggest lack romance.

[charaFace C 2]
＠Mordred
Oh, of course, I'm not talking about that wishy-washy guy!

I haven't heard that word in a while, and it brings back memories. I wonder how Doctor Roman is doing...

＠Mash
I know we're all feeling nostalgic, but Senpai, please make a choice!
