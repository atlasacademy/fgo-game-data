I'm going back to the Land of Sweets to check up on Nursery Rhyme.
[k]

＠Mash
Are you sure about that, Illya?

＠Illya
Yep. I'm concerned about her.
[k]

＠Illya
I know the gems are pointing at the Land of Snow and Honey as the next destination, but...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Illya
I'm sorry for troubling you guys with my arbitrary decisions.

Please don't be. I think the way you feel about her is very sweet.

？1：Sure, it's fine. But we should hurry.

＠Helena
...
[k]

？1：Helena. What kind of magical girl is Connacht☆Medb?
？！


[charaFace D 5]
＠Helena
An intense woman.[sr]She's a magical girl of blazing ice.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Helena
Fierce and merciless. A giant mass of possessiveness. Her rigid nature is like a castle that molds her.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Helena
She holds the reins of all kinds of contradictions, tightly knotted together.
[k]

＠Helena
If the root of a magical girl's power lies in her strength to believe in herself, she must be the strongest one.
[k]


？1：Does that mean...she's almost insane?
？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Helena
Medb? Of course not. Her sanity is beyond doubt.[sr]She's absolutely in her right mind.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Helena
Perhaps she was the only decent one among the rest of us.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Helena
In this warped world, she was probably the only person who managed to keep being herself till the end.
[k]

＠Helena
She had been in this world since before I arrived.[sr]There was a time when we journeyed together...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Helena
But I put some distance between us when she became obsessed with her lust for control.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Helena
After that, she dialed up on her madness.[sr]Or maybe I'm just flattering myself thinking that.
[k]

＠Helena
Most likely, she hadn't changed.[sr]Not at all.
[k]

Helena...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Illya
Medb said she was ready to accept me as a member of her invincible army.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Illya
That's why I mistakenly thought Miyu had been abducted by her.

＠Helena
The formation of Little Witch Codes to rebel against the First Lady's rule. That was her idea.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Helena
So she hasn't given up on that ambition yet.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_32 1.5]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Helena
What's the matter, [%1]?
[k]


？1：Hold on, guys... Aren't those Medb's soldiers?

Yes, they are! Those are the snowfield-specialized hostiles!

They appeared in the neutral zone again! We were off our guard! Doctor, why weren't you on alert!?

That's impossible. We're still on constant alert here. Maybe there was a change in the surrounding environment?

＠Helena
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to fight.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Helena
I may be with you guys, that doesn't make me want to directly stand up against Medb.
[k]

＠Helena
After all, she is one of the magical girls, too.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Helena
In this neutral zone, I wouldn't be able to use that much of my power anyway.
[k]


？1：Okay, then. Stay in a safe area. Mash! Illya!
