＠Mash
...Um, are you sure you're not sick?[sr]You don't look good.
[k]

＠Mash
Um, do you understand me?[sr]Do you remember what we were talking about?
[k]

？1：The Château d'If.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I'm glad. Your consciousness is intact.
[k]

？2：What was it again?

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
!!!
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
I knew it. Your mind isn't fully here.

＠Mash
Your eyes go out of focus as we talk and you keep mumbling[line 3]
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I'll call the Doctor. He didn't see anything in that brief physical yesterday...
[k]

＠Mash
...but I think you need a full medical checkup.[sr]It must be all those Rayshifts...

＠Fergus
Hey, excuse me, Master.[sr]Oh, you're here too, Miss Mash[line 3][charaFace D 2]Wait, what's going on here?
[k]

＠Fergus
You don't look good. You're pale.[sr]Actually, you're as white as a ghost!
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Fergus, good timing![sr]Can you help me with Senpai?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
It's probably better to take Senpai directly to the medical room than wait for the Doctor...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Fergus
Of course. I had a feeling something might be bad.[sr]Looks like I was right.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Fergus
But I don't think that medical-whatsits are gonna help much. No point in worrying about it.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
No point?

＠C：Mercédès
Thank you... I don't even remember my name, but I'll do my best to be helpful.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Do you have the strength to spare for a woman like this?
[k]
[charaFace B 1]
Haha. I'll admit that you have a generous spirit.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
That's right. It's too early for despair.[sr]You should just keep walking forward.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
If you despair and think you cannot fight anymore, tell me. I'll kill you, without waiting for the seven days to pass.
