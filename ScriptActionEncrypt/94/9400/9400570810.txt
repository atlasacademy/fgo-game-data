＠Altria
I think we should be focusing on... “infrastructure maintenance”? Is that what it was?
[k]

＠Altria
We've all gotten used to procuring materials.

[charaFace B 6]
＠Altria
So I believe if we improve the route to carry them, our efficiency should increase.

As long as we're at it, why not spend a bit more time?

＠Altria
What ever do you mean, Sir Mordred?
[k]

＠Mordred
Heh heh. We're going to make a path for the sake of convenience, right? Then why don't we make it even more convenient?

H-Huh?
