Ah. What perfect timing, [%1].[sr]You got a moment?
[k]

＠Emiya
Even though it's a constant for every Master, a life of only fighting is dull.
[k]

＠Emiya
You're still young, and so unless there's some spice to your life[line 3] Hm? No need for life lessons?
[k]

＠Emiya
Just take it, you say?

This is...something that is made from cocoa...and you're giving it to me?
[k]

？1：Just a token of my gratitude.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Emiya
...I see. I need to work on my tendency of going on long rants.
[k]

＠Emiya
I intended to give this to you first, but you beat me to the punch.
[k]

？2：Well, I had leftovers.

[charaFace A 3]

＠Emiya
Ah, right, that's today.[sr]As my contractor, I applaud you for being so popular.
[k]

＠Emiya
Whether you have leftovers because you received too much or made too much, leftovers are a scary thing when all's said and done.
[k]

＠Emiya
I speak from experience. Here, let me share a trick with you... Ah, but I'm getting off-topic.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Emiya
Ahem. Anyway, wait here.
[k]

＠Emiya
It's something similar to what you were doing.[sr]You don't need to brace yourself.

Thanks for waiting. This is just a gift in return for your humble sweets. A humble sentiment of my own.

？！

＠Emiya
Giving the gift of food in exchange for food is no good. After thinking hard on what you are lacking, I came to this conclusion.
[k]

＠Emiya
They are all made for beginners. There's even a warning alarm on some anytime you're in danger of slicing your finger.
[k]

＠Emiya
These days, both men and women do the cooking. This will come in handy for such an age, and it will liven up your days.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Emiya
At first I just had a hot pot for you, but as I thought more about it, I ended up accumulating a whole set of household appliances.
[k]

＠Emiya
Just treat it as the behavior of an overbearing elder. It's been a while since I had to think about getting gifts for someone.
