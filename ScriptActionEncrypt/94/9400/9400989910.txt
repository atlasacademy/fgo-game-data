What? A Valentine's event?[sr]And this is for me, the great Vlad III?
[k]

＠Vlad III
Are you of sound mind? No, of course not. For I am no more than a merciless butcher who slaughters without cause.

[charaFace A 2]
＠Vlad III
And so, to offer a token of affection to me, the very embodiment of impaling... Finally, my contractor has gone truly mad!
[k]

？1：Nope, I'm sane.
？2：Nah, we're both sane.

...Hm. I commend you for saying such a thing even with this bloody armor before you.

＠Vlad III
Then I have but no choice. Do not move.[sr]If you move, I will impale you upon my lance.

Ah, good, you have waited as I instructed. Now, take this.

It may not be quite on par with your intricate gift, but it is certainly more grandiose.

I was once a very restless lord. I practiced sewing and cared for livestock. Sometimes, I even stood before the hearth.
[k]

＠Vlad III
Since I was a military man, I always did what was required each day myself.

＠Vlad III
...Hm. The less...stable me may have superior sewing skills, but, for the moment, we are in my domain.

Fool who would give this heartless, impaling lord chocolate, surrender now and eat my offering.
[k]

＠Vlad III
It will surely fill you up. Show me your resolve by devouring it all this moment!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Vlad III
Should you do so, I will delight you with even more meat dishes. Haha! We shall have our own carnivorous carnival!
