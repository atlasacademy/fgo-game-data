Why? Because you are Santa Claus. There is no such thing as a reward for completing your task.

Fulfilling a wish is intrinsically an unequal thing. Unequal... That is, a problem of desire.
[k]

＠Santa Island Mask
Be it a simple, casual wish or a desperate need with life hanging in the balance, it is Santa Claus who decides whether or not to grant it.
[k]

＠Santa Island Mask
The one who prays and pleads has their wish granted, while those who don't are not so fulfilled.
