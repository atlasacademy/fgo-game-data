＠Mash
Yes, it seems so European. A horse-drawn carriage would not seem out of place here...
[k]

＠Fou
Fou fou.
[k]

＠Mash
Out of all the stone roads...I think the Appian Way is the most famous.
[k]


？1：We may have walked on it when we were in Rome.
？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Yes. As far as I recall it was a solid road.

＠Altria
Rome's great road?[sr]Even in my time I had heard tales of it.
[k]

＠Altria
Well, if I may say so myself, the cobblestone paths in my Camelot were quite fine as well.

Mash, you must be thinking how competitive I am again.

＠Mash
What? Oh, no...I am sorry...
[k]


？1：Sorry, I thought that too.
？2：(Shocked)
？！

＠Altria
...Master, you too? Hah, I do not mind.
[k]

＠Altria
If Nero and Caesar were here with us, they would no doubt boast about the superiority of Roman roads.
[k]

＠Altria
It simply means we are filled with pride for our own nations. It is impossible to proclaim one better than the other.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Altria
Thus, when such patriotic feelings clash, it is not easy to resolve anything.

＠Mash
Altria...?

[charaFace B 0]
＠Altria
It is nothing. Let us head back.
[k]

＠Altria
Stone roads remind me of knights marching home. Their armored heels clanking on them made such loud noises.
[k]

＠Altria
But the sound of sandals going pitter-patter on stone is also charming in its own way.
