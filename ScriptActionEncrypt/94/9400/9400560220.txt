All right, where were we?

＠Scáthach
It's going to take time to build a ship.[sr]It's not something you can do in an afternoon.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Scáthach
Our goal[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Scáthach
Needs to be to find a way to live on this island while we gather the materials we need.
[k]

？1：Live here?

Wood, stone, iron... Other things as well. Don't worry.[sr]I can modify them once I have them.

？！

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
The climate and topography here are both completely different from that in Chaldea. Who knows what kind of natural phenomena we might encounter?
[k]

＠Mash
It is also unclear what we'll face with the environment. And there's the problem of food and water... Will we be okay?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Scáthach
Don't worry. I can make almost anything you need[line 2]including ships.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Some of the knowledge I've acquired includes how to survive, even on an uninhabited island.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Scáthach
If you need anything, you can count on me.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Scáthach
It might be inconvenient at first, but as we make what we need, life will get easier.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Scáthach
Heh. It'll be a form of training.[sr]You'll need to give it your all.
[k]

＠Scáthach
...Now then.[sr]I have a suggestion for everyone[line 3]

Why? First, this island is hot.[sr]Even if you're not wearing armor like Mordred.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Too much heat dulls the body, even if you're a Servant. And the heat affects you in combat too.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Scáthach
A master warrior must adjust their appearance to match their location and conditions.

If you weren't allowed to look at it, it would be no different than being naked.

Averting your gaze is no different than refusing to look someone in the eye when you speak. It's rude.

No need to worry. Even in our tropical island versions, we're still powerful Servants.
