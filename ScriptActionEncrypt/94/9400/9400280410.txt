What does the beach have to do with that paint?

＠Da Vinci
I tasted calcium carbonate.[sr]Maybe they made some of the paint from shells?

So we're here at the beach! Now, who's that fake Servant behind door number three!?

Wait, Mash! Don't get close to him! He's a counterfeit!

But that's Siegfried!

＠Mash
He's the humblest, meekest, and most polite Saber in the entire world!

＠Mash
Even if he's a counterfeit Heroic Spirit, that shouldn't change.

I can't help it. I'm a counterfeit after all. If the original is humble, I must surpass it with my pride to defeat my opponents.
[k]

＠Siegfried
For one thing, isn't it rude to tell someone you're sorry when you're not?

He's right. A very arrogant comment, but he's right!

He's a counterfeit trying to surpass the original, but he's still kind of humble at his core!

[line 3]I am the strongest dragon, descending on a beach beneath the crescent moon. I have nothing to apologize for.

Instead, be bold. Be bolder[line 3][sr]That's what she whispers to me.

She, huh? Hmm, and it's not like she has something against me, right?

＠Da Vinci
Or actually, I don't think she does. If she hated me, she'd be a little more clingy, or sticky[line 2]
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Yes. It's best to say that she's dry.

＠Da Vinci
A dried-up fresco. It lasts for a century,[sr]but will never change.

...That's why you're the most famous artist in the world. You're very perceptive. I commend you for that.

＠Siegfried
But that doesn't mean I can tell you anything. I'm sor...[charaFace D 5][sr]No, you're my enemy, so I'm not sorry at all.
[k]

＠Siegfried
Kindness towards an enemy can only be shown if you have the strength to spare it, and I do not.

[charaFace D 2]
＠Siegfried
Now let's fight, [%1]! I've got no real reason to, but I'll stop you with everything I've got!
