Please answer, Senpai! I can't believe there's no reception over here, either!

My turn. To tell you the truth, we believe in very different gods.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Zhu Bajie
But people learn a lot from each other using the opportunities given to them by the gods.

[charaFace B 3]

So, even though I believe in a different god, this trip has been a valuable experience. Thank you for the rare experience.

I can't be like you, but I will remind myself of you when I'm in trouble.

If I ever gain the Buddha's guidance again and manifest as a Servant in the future...

[%1]... I will take you as my disciple again.

Whaaaat? Isn't that a bit presumptuous? Hahaha.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
You have many people dear to you waiting for you at Chaldea, right?
[k]

＠Sanzang
But for being a fantastic neophyte who plays a key role in the survival of humanity, I might give you that side benefit.
[k]


？2：If that's the case, I want you to call me Master!

[charaFace A 3]
＠Sanzang
That's...um, well, that depends on the merits you will have accrued by that day.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sanzang
...That's why I won't say goodbye.[sr]Instead, I will recite a blissful sutra.

So you will have perfect health, okay?[sr][line 3][charaFace A 1]Ahem!

Apparently it's called... “Records of the Journey to the Far West with [%1].”

I think the tea will be the perfect complement to a recounting of your adventure.
