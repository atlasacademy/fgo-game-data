＠Gilles
Heh... Sorry, but she's all right.

＠Gilles
She is not a lonely girl who had faith foisted on her and was forced into seclusion.
[k]

＠Gilles
She is not a warrior who continues forward, even while bearing wounds that won't heal. She is not a moralizing saint.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Gilles
No miracle will happen, no revelation.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Gilles
Even though she was just a counterfeit... She's trying to spread her wings out in the world as an individual!

[charaFace D 1]
＠Gilles
I dream of the eventual day when we shall meet again somewhere far away. Farewell...

If I had to guess, I would say someone like Karna.

Kojirou Sasaki is also a possibility.

No, wait.[sr]It can't be. There's no way.

[charaFace A 4]

Ohh, Blackbeard? Hm...

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mash
That's impossible, Master![sr]U-Um, did you receive a blow to the head!?
[k]

Mozart, huh? Well, he does have good facial features...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Emiya
But if he opened his mouth, it'd be no good.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Da Vinci
Well, listen. If he were the “Silent Musician” type and did nothing, there would be no problem.
