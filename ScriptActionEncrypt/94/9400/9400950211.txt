Huh? She disappeared. I didn't even hit her that hard, though...
[k]

？1：She went back to Chaldea.

＠Musashi
I see. Glad I didn't end up killing her.[sr]Okay, moving on!
[k]

＠Musashi
From the look of things, these, um... Servants, you call them? I bet they'll be at the other gates, too.
[k]

＠Musashi
It'll be good if we can talk things out with them, but if we have to fight, that's fine too!
[k]

＠Musashi
Wielding my sword will probably restore my memories, and I'm happy for any chance to fight a strong opponent!
