Everyone's been going back and forth to the cafeteria. How many times do they need to go there before they're satisfied?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Guess today's one of those days where it doesn't matter if you're a Heroic Spirit or human. It's good that everyone's so friendly.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
It may be peaceful right now, but the irregularities with humanity still haven't been resolved. Whether it be the Incineration of Humanity, or fixing things afterward[line 3] Hm?

＠Cú Chulainn
Yo, [%1], are you handing out chocolates too?
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Then head to the cafeteria. The eager Servants are all congregating there while they try to contain their excitement.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
I just came from there. It was so uncomfortable in there, I couldn't handle it...
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
To be honest, now that I've gotten a little wiser, I'm having trouble getting into it.
[k]

？1：I see. Then have some chocolates.
？2：I get it. Then have some chocolates.

You're not making any sense! Ah, I see![sr]You're the one who is the most excited, Master!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Cú Chulainn
Am I unhappy, you ask?[sr]Well, you know...
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
If it was Halloween, maybe, but I'm really not the sort to get excited over other countries' festivities.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn

[charaFace A 3]
＠Cú Chulainn
But you know, I can't complain about a gift I've been given. That's even more immature.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
Well, immature doesn't mean I'm going against the flow. I'm just saying that if something makes you happy, show it.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
Besides, this druid getup is all a sham anyway! There's no point in maintaining a tough stance at this point!
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Thanks, [%1]! I'll savor this bit by bit.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
I'll return the favor sometime soon.[sr]I'll take you to a special place.
[k]


＠Cú Chulainn
All right. The first step is to procure a staff. That trail is a tough one to the inexperienced.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Guess I'd better look for a good ash tree. I'd better show some Caster-like qualities once in a while.
