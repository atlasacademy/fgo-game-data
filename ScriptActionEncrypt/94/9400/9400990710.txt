＠Ryougi Shiki
Hello. I let myself into your room to wait.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Unfortunately, it's not handmade, but I took my time selecting it.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
My heart was racing like an ordinary girl when I was thinking about what kinds of things you liked.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Ryougi Shiki
So, what do you think? How do you like it?
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
You're a Master of Chaldea.[sr]I'm sure you've received tons of chocolates.
[k]

？1：That's...not true.

＠Ryougi Shiki
Oh, then I'm glad. You really are good with words,[sr][%1].
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
But when you speak, you should look straight into my eyes. If you don't, you might make an opening to let the other attack.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
For example... See?
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
I see that your eyes are wandering toward that closet. What if there was a present hidden in there?
[k]

？2：Even if I have, THIS is a first!

[charaFace A 3]
＠Ryougi Shiki
Th-that... What a response. I wasn't expecting that.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
It's a bold statement, but your sentiments are conveyed. Yes. Thank you, Master.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ryougi Shiki
But this is my first Valentine's Day. Making only my heart race doesn't seem fair.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Ryougi Shiki
Then let me formally say that I look forward to working with you this year. I shall try my best to keep this dream continuing on ahead.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Now, aren't you hungry? Shall we have some New Year's food before we have our Japanese confectionary?
[k]

？1：I did notice my room is full of New Year's stuff!

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Ryougi Shiki
Yes. It's a bit late, but I wanted this to go hand in hand with my New Year's greeting. So I overwrote it without your permission.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
The Lunar New Year has also passed, but I am a Servant in a kimono, so I wanted something fitting.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
That's why I cut-in from the front.[sr]After all...
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Doesn't attacking with a weapon no one else has make me a first-class Servant?
[k]
