You're asking where “Tianzhu” is?[sr]It's India, of course.

＠Zhu Bajie
India? Oh, at this pace I thought we were going to Rome or somewhere over there.

[charaFace C 4]
＠Sha Wujing
At the time Xuanzang Sanzang arrived in Tianzhu, Mahayana Buddhism had already perished and even the famous Jetavana Monastery had fallen into ruin.

＠Sha Wujing
It is said that what precious teachings survived were left in the hands of a few monasteries and rare scriptures...

＠Sanzang
Those two are great heroes as well as demi-gods, the embodiments of my fear...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Sanzang
The fear of going to the outside world, the anxiety that[sr]I can't brush off.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I was summoned...as Chaldea's Servant.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanzang
But since I believed I had reached enlightenment and abandoned all earthly desires[line3] I refused the summon.
[k]

＠Sanzang
The Buddha will never concern himself with the extinction of humanity. To him, it is only one of the many ripples in existence.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Sanzang
If so, it is only my selfishness as a “human being.”
[k]

？1：(That's why the summoning experiment was incomplete...)
？2：(But it's probably Da Vinci's fault.)

You are the Buddha's messenger, sent to complete this broken scroll.

＠Sanzang
Or perhaps you're like a lens for me to perceive the Buddha in this hollow world.
