I can hear the festival... Did you yourself realize why I was angry, or did someone bring it to your attention?
[k]

＠Vlad III
If the former, then you show some promise.
[k]

＠Vlad III
If the latter, then they showed you sympathy.
[k]

＠Vlad III
The verdict looks only at the results. If the people were satisfied, then you have the right to proceed.

＠Vlad III
However, in this form I am especially strict with you.
[k]

＠Vlad III
You have committed many sins...
[k]

＠Vlad III
One of which I, having become a Heroic Spirit, simply cannot ignore.
[k]

＠Vlad III
...I won't say to atone for it with death.[sr]For there is no way to atone.

＠Vlad III
As a king, I demonstrate magnanimity while I suffer within. But as a warrior, I shall never show mercy toward wickedness.
[k]

＠Vlad III
You... Evil killer who committed depraved acts, toyed with the citizens, and thought it only natural to be ignorant...
[k]

＠Vlad III
Your sins are a nightmare from which no one can wake, even after 100 years. What you have done is committed a crime engraved in history.
[k]

＠Vlad III
It is time you return to the darkness where no one can venture. I shall slaughter every last one of you.
