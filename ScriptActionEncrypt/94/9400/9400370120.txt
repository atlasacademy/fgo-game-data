Good work.[sr]I've finally got your coordinates now.

Someday we may have to take a geography test with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.

When that happens, this information should come in handy. Thank you very much.

Mash, you can be rather brutal sometimes...[sr]Okay, one more piece of new info.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You were just talking about an aroma, right?[sr]I got curious, so I analyzed it...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's ethanol mixed in with the air.[sr]Fruits and crops fermented using yeast.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In other words, alcohol. What you're smelling is wine.

That's true. It's usually stories of someone getting drunk and embarrassing themselves!

I'm seeing a slight change on her vitals.[sr]She's drunk.

Drunk? Just on this aroma?
[k]


[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Yeah. It doesn't seem to be affecting you, though.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's because of the alcohol that's permeating the air. That's what's gotten into the people around you, too.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Whoever breathes it in gets drunk.[sr]That's why they're all acting like that.

How about you, [%1]?[sr]Anything seem strange?

？1：Not really. I'm sober.
