It could be problematic if there are more boars like that who can produce miasma and corrupt this island...

Eventually we might have to do this all over again.

All right then. First let's do something about this impure swamp first. Here's some holy water, then...

...Ahem. Sorry you had to see that.[sr]It seems I didn't pray enough to prove my faith.

I'm sure it's because I was using the coastal rocks as punching bags to train myself...
[k]

And ended up changing the landscape a bit because[sr]I was going at it too hard... Please forgive me...

The previous one was rather small in scale, but this one's corrosion is too severe... I can't get rid of it.

Hmm... Yes, it will be difficult, but it's better than doing nothing. Here, let me help.
[k]

＠Scáthach
I happen to have these ash tree seeds with me. I'll make it so that they grow by absorbing the poison in the ground.

The effects won't be immediate, though.[sr]As Martha said, the poison is deep.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Plants also take large amounts of time to grow strongly. If you rush things, they will lose to the miasma and quickly wither away.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Scáthach
They need to carefully absorb each drop of poison, slowly but surely. It'll take a long, long time...

Exactly how long is a “long, long time”?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Scáthach
Well, roughly 1,000 years?
[k]

？1：That's long!
？！

[charaFace F 0]
＠Scáthach
But, in that case, the land will eventually be able to return to its original state.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Scáthach
Only the next best strategy can be taken if nothing can be done immediately.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Scáthach
If we combine her holy water with these seeds, we'll at least be able to prevent the poisonous swamp from expanding any more than now.

Right. It's better than doing nothing, surely.[sr]We may not be around anymore at that time though.

＠Marie
Since we're guests here, it would be a form of giving back to the island, no? To take back its future, so to speak.

Hmm. It would be safe to say that there are still demon boars around.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Fortunately, however, we still have a few ash tree seeds.
[k]

＠Scáthach
If we find more poisonous swamps like this, or more other demon boars that produce them,
[k]

＠Scáthach
we'll need to deal with them in the future too.[sr]Try not to miss any, Master...!
