Hmm-hmm♪[sr]La-la-laaa♪

＠Dr. Roman
Whoa, [%1].[sr]Why are you looking at me like that?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Mmm, it's like you're saying “I, myself, don't know, but this must be a form of happiness.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Your expression is like a mixture of spiritual insight,[sr]affection, and a little pity. Has something happened?
[k]

？1：No, but, Doctor finally...

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
What, were you watching me?
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Dr. Roman
And what do you mean by “finally?”[sr]I didn't do anything!
[k]

？2：Why are you walking around with an empty plate?

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Yeah, that's the problem. I keep waiting and waiting, but Mash hasn't come back yet.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I asked her to grab something from storage for me,[sr]but I wonder if something happened...
[k]

Hey, Romani, where are the dumplings?[sr]I'm about to show footage of the moon.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Let's hurry up and hit the booze.[sr]After all, we've been holding out for this day.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
...Hmph, yeah right. That's what you say,[sr]but you've already started drinking like a fish, you lout...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Wait a little while longer, Da Vinci.[sr]Not all the staff members are here yet.
[k]

？1：Alcohol?

？2：Dumplings?

？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Huh? [%1], didn't you hear? The outdoor calendar shows it's almost the end of summer.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Meaning it's almost time for the Moon Festival.[sr]It's said the harvest moon shall liven up conversations between friends.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
The date isn't exactly right, but as long as there's a beautiful full moon in the night sky, it's perfect for the Moon Festival.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's not a lot to do for fun in Chaldea, so I prepared this thinking we could use a break, but...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Mash hasn't come back yet.[sr]She was getting the dumplings from food storage.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She said, “I'm powerful now that I've become a Demi-Servant, so leave it to me.” Then she took off on her own...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
I have a bad feeling about this.[sr][%1], go see what's up[line 3]

This is serious, Doctor![sr]Someone has raided our food storage!
[k]

＠Mash
As well as the offerings we prepared for the festival and everything else... Chaldea's food reserves are nearly down to zero!
[k]

[seStop ad9]

[charaFace A 1]

Ah. Good morning.[sr]I'm happy to see you're as healthy as ever.

Is this the place for that kind of conversation?[sr]I'm impressed by how much you trust each other.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Ah... Thank you.[sr]My eyes are good so I don't really need them, but...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Okay, look around you.[sr]This is supposed to be a tense scene.

＠Dr. Roman
No, this is not the time to discuss that.[sr]Somebody raided our food storage. Who could it be?!
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
The thing is... None of the surveillance cameras picked[sr]up anything... They're not broken, but...
[k]

＠Mash
...but it's like all of the recorded footage has been painted over with a heart mark, so we can't see anything.
[k]

＠Mash
The analysis team in the monitor room said...
[k]

＠Mash
“When we watched the footage, we got dizzy and fell unconscious, one right after the other...”

Hmm...[sr]I see. This is a real pickle.

A pickle?![sr]Leonardo, have you gone bonkers, too?!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
Ah, pardon me. I was just having a bit of fun.[sr]But anyway, Romani, take a look at this Singularity.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Three minutes ago, someone Rayshifted to France.[sr]That must've been the cause of the alarm.
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
Rayshift... With no authorization, and solo?[sr]You're saying the culprit escaped by Rayshifting?
[k]

＠Mash
I can't imagine a Servant capable of something like that...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
Good point.[sr]Right now, Chaldea doesn't exist in normal dimension.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The only ones who can go outside are Master[sr][%1] and [&his:her] contracted Servants.
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]
[charaFadein D 0.1 2]
＠Da Vinci
On the other hand, a Contracted Servant can do evil deeds.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But only special and extremely powerful Heroic Spirits[sr]could bend the rules of time and space.
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaFadeout B 0.1]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...Um, did you make a contract with such a powerful Servant?
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Mash
There are no records of it, as far as I know...

[charaFadein B 0.1 0]
[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
Yes, but the order of cause and effect would be opposite, you see?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We're talking about a Heroic Spirit that could bend time and space, and stretch the string of possibility for “eventually forming a contract”
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Da Vinci
into the “eventual outcome of a contract.”[sr]It would be an incredibly powerful Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Dr. Roman
...If it finds the coordinates of Chaldea using nonsensical[sr]means like that, that's incredible...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But... I see,
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
if the culprit here is a Heroic Spirit who's willing to form a contract with [%1].
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Then the damage we suffer wouldn't be critical.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Because whatever the future, [%1] wouldn't form a contract with an outright villain.
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaFadein A 0.1 2]
[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
No, Doctor.[sr]The problem is that we don't have any food left.
[k]

＠Mash
At this rate, Senpai's health management and[sr]tea time after a Grail expedition can't be guaranteed.
[k]

＠Mash
As the Master's Servant, I propose we take measures quickly.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Y-yeah, I guess this is not the time to be thinking, “If we're out of sweet dumplings, we can just have sweet bean paste instead.”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[%1].[sr]For the sake of Chaldea's future,
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
and our fun Moon Festival, would you go check out the situation for us?
[k]

？1：Yes I'll go, Doctor.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
I knew I could count on you.[sr]That's why you're the Master of Chaldea.
[k]

？2：You really like sweet bean paste, huh?

[charaFace B 3]
＠Dr. Roman
Well, of course. Sugar is indispensable to someone who works with his brain.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Actually, I was more of a pancake guy, but I got addicted to it when I went to Japan. Hahaha.

(The culprit must be a Divine Spirit-class Servant[sr]that can Rayshift by itself...)
