[%1].[sr]What are you doing here?
[k]

＠Ishtar
You weren't at the Command Room, nor your room. You weren't even at the cafeteria or Da Vinci's Workshop.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Is this what you call taking a stroll? If you were going to walk around, you should've gone to the training room.
[k]


？1：No, I'm not taking a walk...

？！

[charaFace A 10]
＠Ishtar
Then what? Walking around the halls with that wistful look on your face makes you seem totally suspicious!
[k]

[charaFace A 9]
＠Ishtar
Huh? I look more suspicious, you say? I'm not one to randomly talk to others without a reason?
[k]

＠Ishtar
You're expecting something like “I broke another piece of Chaldea's equipment, and I need you to fix it”?
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Ishtar
Y-yeah... I know you've helped me a few times, but today is supposed to be a trouble-free day.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I'm only talking to you to say good morning, it's not anything special. Jeez...
[k]

？1：Okay! Hand over the chocolate!
？2：Am I about to get a gift from a goddess?

？！

[charaFace A 16]
＠Ishtar
[fontSize large]That's direct!
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Ishtar
Y-you're rather straightforward.[sr]I forgot that you were like that.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Ishtar
Well, I at least know what Valentine's Day is.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I know I'll regret it if I don't do something, and if it's a feeling of gratitude for your daily work, I may have a little something for that...
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Ishtar
... (Sigh) There's no point in me holding back.[sr]I've lost from the get-go.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Ever since I've been in this Spirit Origin, it's been nothing but trouble. I feel like I've become too lenient, or that I get excited whenever I'm challenged...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Ishtar
Oh, well. Anyway, take this, [%1].
[k]

＠Ishtar
I've somewhat arranged it so that it would be appropriate for a contemporary person such as yourself. Both its appearance and taste should be superb.

Right? Right? I'm quite proud of how it turned out.
[k]

＠Ishtar
They say laughter leads to happiness, but in my case, beautiful things lead to bonuses.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Ishtar
I bless you with divine favor, with the hope that I see a share of it as well. That's why I worked hard on it♡ However you use it, it'll be a good thing for us both if your wallet gets fat, right?
[k]

＠Ishtar
If Master benefits, I benefit.[sr]If Master gets rich, it'll benefit my growth!
[k]

？1：Thank you. This makes me happy.
？2：Thank you. I'm happy...I think.

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Ishtar
So. What are you going to do now?[sr]As you can see, I'm a bit bored.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Ishtar
You received my Valentine's Day chocolate.[sr]Don't tell me we're done here...
[k]

＠Ishtar
I'm expecting an extra special, gorgeous escort befitting a first-class Master like yourself!
