Not bad. Not bad at all. I prefer plump, delicious fruit, but this is not bad.

＠Caesar
Excellent form. Easy to transport. Keeps for days.[sr]And more than anything, easy to eat!
[k]

＠Caesar
Yes, yes, yes, yes![sr]What is this? I can't stop putting them in my mouth!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Caesar
Once you start, you just can't stop! I've got no[sr]choice but to eat all the dumplings in the world!

Heh, I see you're devouring them, too.[sr]You're not a true Roman emperor unless you love to eat.

Though I guess I'm not really an emperor.[sr]I just laid the foundations for an empire.

There's a huge pile of dumplings behind them...[sr]We finally reached our main target, I guess.

＠Orion
What will you do?[sr]Try to talk to them?
[k]

？1：I don't think that'll work.

＠Mash
Y-yes... The tyrant Caligula is a Berserker.[sr]We won't be able to talk to him.
[k]

＠Mash
Caesar is a Saber, so we can communicate with him,[sr]but he's also a little TOO good at talking.
[k]

＠Mash
If we try to talk to him, he might just “round” up the conversation in his favor.

Yeah...He's really...round.

For now, let's approach them, Senpai.

＠Mash
If we attack them from the front then we're in[sr]accordance with the laws of chivalry, we won't be cowards.
[k]

？1：You seem like you're getting angry.

？2：Chival...ry?

...Sigh. You interrupted my wonderful snack time...[sr]A mess. This is truly a mess.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Caesar
But I guess you've appeared at last.[sr]You're here for these Moon Festival dumplings, right?
[k]

＠Caesar
I managed to embezzle these from that wicked Rider...

And I have a just reason for doing so.[sr]Well? Will you listen to me, milady?

＠Caesar
You will, of course! Everyone listens to me![sr]My speeches are said to be worth their weight in gold!
[k]

＠Caesar
So allow me to tell you how I made these dumplings mine.

U-um, that's not necessary...[sr]Let's just fight. Yeah. Fight.

I'm not really interested in the reason.[sr]Please just give them back...

Hmm, no good, huh?[sr]I thought I could pull it off.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Caesar
And Caligula, you too?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Caesar
Anyway, allow me to continue. Traveling this[sr]bountiful land, I encountered a delicious scent.
[k]

＠Caesar
And then[line 3]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Caesar
...No response, huh?[sr]Sad...How very sad...
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Caesar
Anyway, I sensed a wicked plot was involved. Thinking I should probably take action, I confiscated them.
[k]

＠Caesar
But if they were stolen, I can understand your anger.[sr]A sense of righteousness can create stronger feelings than revenge.
[k]

＠Caesar
I dislike fighting. It's a pain.[sr]So let's do this.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Caesar
First, I will trust you, and give you back these dumplings.
[k]

＠Caesar
You will go around and sell them at three times the price, then come back.
[k]

＠Caesar
I'll take the money, and give you no less than double what they're worth!
[k]

＠Caesar
Well? Your gain, not loss, and I get the satisfaction of having trusted you.
[k]

＠Caesar
How about I give them back to you under these terms?
[k]

？1：Ooh...So peaceful!

That's right, Master.

Martha was correct.[sr]Talking to Caesar is a waste of time.
