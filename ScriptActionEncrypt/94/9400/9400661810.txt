I need to ask...

Is there another perverted magical girl fanboy waiting for us? Like the leader of the Four Heavenly☆Magical Gentlemen?

It's like how the First Lady took over Chloe...no, you look like Illya!

[charaFadein B 0.1 1]

I'm stunned. Instead of using my body this time, a form was created directly out of magical energy?

Don't call me a knockoff! You don't have any issues with my Cosmos design, right?

？！

But, well, I am a bit relieved.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chloe
I was afraid Mama was going to appear. “Prisma☆Iri has descended in all of her splendor!” she'd say.

Phantom, Gilles de Rais, Diarmuid, and Blackbeard.

Through their mighty wishes and noble sacrifices, I was able to form into a genuine existence. Heehee.

＠Testament
It's true. I am the crystallization of their thoughts.[sr]An idol created by sad gentlemen.
[k]

＠Testament
Just as a girl's feelings become a magical girl's driving force, the wishes of those gentlemen gave me life and let me soar.

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Mash
You're the crystallization of their thoughts? [charaFace A 0]No, I don't think so. And it wasn't so much their wishes as it was their obsession.

[charaFadein B 0.1 1]

＠Chloe
True. And instead of noble, let's go with pathetic.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chloe
I know I'm one to talk, considering I was involved heavily in the first half of the event, but you're really warped.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Chloe
How many times do I have to say that it's meaningless to change the world with magic based on sacrifices?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chloe
More than anything, it's annoying to hear those words come out of someone who looks like Illya. So knock it off.

＠Testament
Heehee, you have a problem with sacrifices?[sr]They were happy to offer themselves to me.
[k]

＠Testament
I will give them everything.[sr]But I am not going to repay them.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Testament
If that's what they wanted, there are plenty of women in the real world.
[k]

＠Testament
All they need is to be captivated by my dancing during the ending credits.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Testament
Just loop a recycled transformation sequence until it's burned into their retinas.

[charaEffect D bit_talk_06b2]

The more the wishes of men are full of gloom and a hopeless sense of inferiority, the more brilliantly my dream shines!

Identifying yourself as a “fan” out of some silly pride is just embarrassing.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Testament
You know what it is?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Testament
In the world of magical girls, filthy men are worse than demons. They're worthless scum.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Testament
And you know what else?

[charaFace D 3]

My tale has only just begun, so I'll leave you with a parting gift, demons!

[charaFace D 1]
＠Testament
While gathering the wishes of men and turning them into despair, I'll leave them with minimum HP and inspire in them vain hope.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]

So don't interfere with my journey of endlessly granting bittersweet heaven and hell!
