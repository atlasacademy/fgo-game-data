Yeah, I detected the provisions near you,[sr]and activated the Rayshift.

＠Dr. Roman
You have nothing else left to do, right?[sr]Then hurry and come back to Chaldea.

＠Dr. Roman
The Moon Festival party will be waiting for you.

Yes...That's right.[sr]We did achieve our goals, but...

？！

＠Mash
That's right. I don't see her anymore.[sr]I wanted to thank her for her help...

Hmph. I'm still here.[sr]Do you have any goodbyes for me?

？1：You were useless against Altera.

＠Caesar
I can't help it. It's my class affinity.[sr]I wouldn't be more useful than that woman Archer.
[k]

？2：Want to join us for the Moon Festival at Chaldea?

[charaFace C 0]
＠Caesar
No, thank you. The offer is enough.[sr]Unknown Master, I hope we meet again someday.

Yes, it means one less enemy.[sr]You understand war well.

＠Caesar
And so I shall give you one final warning.
[k]

＠Caesar
When it comes to food, the first owner[sr]and the last owner are different.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Caesar
So who is the true owner of these dumplings?
[k]

＠Caesar
Was it the one who prepared them? No.[sr]The one who cooked them? Even less so.
[k]

＠Caesar
Then who do they belong to?[sr]They belong to the one who is last to eat them.
[k]

＠Caesar
You claimed ownership of the dumplings, but from[sr]“that person's” perspective, that's nothing but a joke.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Caesar
Listen well. If you fail to realize this, the truth will remain forever hidden in darkness.

It wouldn't be on Chaldea's side, but your own.

Some kind of problem should have shown up[sr]during the time you Rayshifted and when the comms came back online...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[%1], any idea?
[k]

？1：...A little.
