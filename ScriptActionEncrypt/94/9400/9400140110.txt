[line 2]That moment, I continue to repeat that moment.

Throughout the continued repetition of human history, that moment in my life... Even if it is insignificant in all that has happened...

Even if it was just me slaying my enemy.

The indescribable sadness, anger, happiness, and more than anything[line 2]relief, I can still remember it.

...Relief.[sr]Yes, that can only be called "relief."

Like when a scab is torn off, it's an odd pleasure. The fear that sent a shiver up my spine, it too has vanished into thin air.

But I was unable to touch the arrow that I myself had shot. Nor was I able to claim his head.

I could only stand there, dazed[line 2]and accept the glorious victory.

Are you all right?
[k]

＠???
Napping during a storm such as this, you must have some nerves of steel.
[k]

？1：Where in the world am I?

[charaFace B 4]
＠???
Good question.[sr]...To be perfectly honest, I do not know myself.
[k]

＠???
When I awoke, I was on this ship, being tossed about in this storm.
[k]

＠???
I have knowledge of how to steer a ship, but I'm afraid all we can do is ride this out.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠???
As that is the case, I decided that I should speak with you, since you were leisurely napping here. Also, I had nothing better to do, either.
[k]

？2：Who are you?

[charaFace B 4]
＠???
...I'm not sure how to answer that.[sr]You see, I am not entirely sure myself.
[k]

＠???
I am a nameless man. The only thing that I remember is that I am an Archer Servant.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠???
...I also have no idea where this ship will take us.[sr]Though I am a Servant, I don't even know who I am.
[k]

＠???
It does seem that you are my Master.[sr]If possible, may I accompany you for a while?
[k]

？1：That is fine.

[charaFace B 1]
＠???
Thank you. My name... Though I do not know it,[sr]I am sure I am an Archer Servant.
[k]

＠???
It is nice to meet you, Master.

Mash? I am not sure...[sr]There may be someone else inside this ship.

However, I do know that I am an Archer. As you can see, I carry a bow for a weapon. So quite obviously I am.

＠A：Mash
Well, uhm...Excuse me. I don't mean to seem rude, but that's not a Class that can be determined by one's weapon.

＠A：Mash
In this world where an Archer can wield two swords, or strike with a club...
[k]

＠A：Mash
...and even hurl valuable treasures at random...

It's a bit premature to assume you're an Archer just because you carry a bow.

That is so like you, Senpai. You've been like that since I found you sound asleep in the corridor at Chaldea!

There's no way I can even relax. In fact, I feel a little sick...

No matter how many times I've been through this, I still can't get used to a ship deck during a storm...
