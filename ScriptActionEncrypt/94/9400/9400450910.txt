Hmm. Be careful, everyone. I suspected this would happen, but I'm detecting a Servant.

It's your dependable shrine maiden fox who has borrowed a smidge of the divine wine, the beautiful and tipsy Tamamo-no-Mae!

Tamamo-no-Mae! What are you doing here!?

(Sigh) How nice it must be to be you. Whenever, wherever, you're always so straightforward and pure.

？1：If you would, please.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
How fortunate for you. That would bring tears to this hot-headed, animal-ear-wearing, high-flying Tamamo.
[k]

[charaFace G 2]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...But if you've already figured it out, then I wish you'd have done something about it sooner!
[k]

？！

[charaFace G 5]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I... I have...been waiting here forever.
[k]

[charaFace G 2]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I've been thinking how unfair it is that Nero is so lucky![sr]I want a grand stage made just for me, too!
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
...What?
[k]

[charaTalk G]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Onigashima! It's Onigashima! This Japanese-style stage! Onigashima means Momotarou. And when you think of Momotarou, how can you forget his three companions...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
But then, why?[sr]W-H-Y[line 2]!!

Why am I not in the role of the dog!?

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Look at these! What do you think these ears are for, huh? Do you understand!?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Is there anyone more suitable than me to play the part of the dog? If there is, then let them come forward!

That glint in her eyes, it's just like an oni! That's the look of an oni god! The same type as Masako-sama!

“They've probably just forgotten, that must be it.” I kept lying to myself, but of course, no matter how long I waited, the offer never came.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I just couldn't put up with it any longer.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
That's when I thought I would just go to Onigashima myself, and force my way onto the stage.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
But, that is where a heroine's self-respect comes in.[sr]Yes, I do have pride.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I couldn't exactly do it sober, so I got hammered with some wine from some teahouse.
[k]

[charaFace G 6]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I let myself go and decided to stand in your way. Since you wanted to know, that's what's going on here☆

Buzz off! Mine is a problem that a leading character like you, Kintoki, wouldn't understand. I've got a poem for people like you.

Don't assume that you / Will always have a part to play / As Master's Servant!

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
So let's fight. Who wants to battle me for the dog role?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Despite how I look, I'm a real carnivore...[sr]I'm a savage honey badger.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
That attitude that makes you disregard me while you proceed with the story[line 2] I'll straighten it out right now!

Don't do it, Kotarou! Tamamo may not seem like it, but she is easily hurt and easily angered!

The rule in dealing with her is to not comment on anything you think is odd with her!

He is the embodiment of technique, and I have established myself as someone who pleases the one she loves with a number of techniques.
