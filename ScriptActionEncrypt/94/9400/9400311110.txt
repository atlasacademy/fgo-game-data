＠El-Melloi
All right, now that we've settled things with Saber...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It was a de facto peace treaty, yeah. But what about Lancer... What about Lord Archibald?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
He's still enemies with Saber over the Grail, right?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
That's the problem. There's a limit to what you can do when you're trying to be friends with both sides.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Hmm... Seems like we'll need to come up with another plan.

Do you have some way to persuade him?

＠El-Melloi
If you want to convince someone of something, the fastest way is to present them with an illusion they want to hear.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
As Lord Kayneth thinks that the world revolves around him...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
...he's likely to believe anything that reinforces that.[sr]A true strategist can control people's minds with ease.

The Stone Sentinel Maze is perfect for keeping out Assassins. It's like having your own portable workshop.

You fell into my clutches the second you tried to sneak up on me!
