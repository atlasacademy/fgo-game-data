I'll have some for myself[line 3]Ahem.[sr]This is...Oho! It's hot! It's hot, but sweet!
[k]

＠Georgios
It seems simple, but you don't tire of it.[sr]It has a smooth surface, but a complex taste.
[k]

＠Georgios
Simple, yet deep.[sr]How to describe it?

You describe it as tasty, you two.[sr]If you'll excuse me, I'll have one myself.

Hmm... Mm...They're bite-sized, but not so small that it's not enough.

[charaFace E 4]

These dumplings are clearly the work of a master.[sr]I am in awe.

No, I was just wondering what that black,[sr]honey-like sauce was.

[charaFace D 5]

I don't want one for myself.[sr]For one thing, I don't trust you.

Hahaha. You saw right through me.[sr]When I have to act like a samurai, I can.

＠Kojirou
I am a wanderer, I act differently at different times.
[k]

＠Kojirou
But I'm not the only one.[sr]You seem to be carrying such burden as well.

＠Kojirou
A particularly big one.[sr]Tarasque, was it?

＠Martha
Huh!? You're after my Tarasque?[sr]Not me!?
[k]

＠Martha
I don't know how many wyverns you've taken down,[sr]but I doubt you can do anything with that skimpy sword?
[k]

＠Martha
Don't underestimate the scales of the Tarasque.[sr]They were thick enough to withstand one of my punches!

Perhaps you're hard of hearing?[sr]I'm a saint. I would never punch anyone.

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[charaFadein C 0.1 1]
＠Georgios
Hahaha. Come to think of it, before “He” gave her the[sr]staff, St. Martha was completely empty-handed, I'm told.
[k]

＠Georgios
So before you settled in as a Saint, you were fighting dragons with your bare hands, huh?
[k]

＠Georgios
I find that fascinating. As a fellow dragon slayer,[sr]I would've liked to have caught that with my camera.
[k]

[charaFadeout C 0.1]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
[charaFace D 2]
＠Martha
I have not punched any dragons! I don't street-brawl anymore, and I've never fought with my bare hands in my life!
[k]

＠Martha
And Georgios, didn't you say you only photographed landscapes?

So I think you became guilty the moment you ate them.

But if you just give them back, we can forget all about it...

We paid for this food, but if it was stolen in the first place...
[k]

＠Georgios
Miss, we've never met before, but you seem to be telling the truth.

I'll return this bag of food to you.[sr]That is the least we can do.

Of course.[sr]We're famous saints, you know.

We admit when we're wrong, and strive to correct it.[sr]Though I do wish I could've had some more.
[k]

＠Martha
And only St. Georgios paid any money.[sr]Since I am not at any loss I don't really mind.
