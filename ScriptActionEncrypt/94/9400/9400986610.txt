＠Billy
Whoa, chocolates![sr]Nice. Sweet things warm me up!
[k]

＠Billy
The wastelands in the winter are harsh.[sr]I'm grateful to have things like this around.

＠Billy
I used to sit in front of a fire and put tons of sugar in my coffee until it got real thick.
[k]

＠Billy
And then I'd eat chocolate with it![sr]Just thinking about it warms me up!
[k]

＠Billy
...Um, that means I need to give something back.
[k]

＠Billy
I wonder what would be good?[sr]Ah-ha!
[k]

＠Billy
Hold on. I think it's in my pocket...[sr]Hmmm...

？1：A bullet?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Billy
Yeah, but it's not just an ordinary bullet.[sr]It's a silver bullet. Made of real, pure silver.
[k]

＠Billy
It's useless against most enemies, though![sr]I made it, but I didn't know what to do with it.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Billy
Hey, hey, don't get so disappointed.[sr]It's not something that was lying around.
[k]

＠Billy
A silver bullet is a weapon against calamity!
[k]

＠Billy
This is an ace in the hole to get through various hardships and tribulations.
[k]

＠Billy
When you're in trouble, you should pray with this bullet. It may inspire you to get through your trouble.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Billy
Yeah, but before that would even happen, we Servants are here to protect you!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Billy
Do everything that's necessary, and do all you can within the limits of your ability.
[k]

＠Billy
But if there is some unknown danger ahead, praying is not cowardice.
[k]

＠Billy
As long as you have the will to never give up, something should come to your aid.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Billy
Master, now that we're warmed up, let's continue our journey.
