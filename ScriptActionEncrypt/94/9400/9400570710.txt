＠Scáthach
That being said, this is our first farm. We must decide wisely on what kind of livestock to raise.
[k]

＠Scáthach
...I, for one, recommend standard cattle.[sr]For their meat and their milk.

Yes. Eating meat gives you strength![sr]Don't eat it and you won't get strength! It's simple logic!
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
My, my. Sex appeal takes a backseat to appetite for some of these people.

[charaFace D 5]

Hngh! Are you any different, fox-ears?

Normally I may stray to my feral instincts. Cat as well.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
But in my current form, I'm a well-to-do fox shrine maiden by the shore.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
So instead of making a decision based on my feral nature, I'll go for an aristocratic and elegant decision!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Therefore, let's go with sheep. Yes, sheep. We can also expand our development by using their high-grade wool to make clothes!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
And we can use the meat from the others as provisions.
[k]


？1：But you're in swimsuits...

[charaFace E 3]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
There are many other uses for it as well.[sr]I'll give you the details on that once we do it!
[k]


？2：Fluffy wool, huh? Fluffy sounds good.

[charaFace E 5]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Ah! Uh-oh! Did I just dig myself a hole!?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Nah, it's not like wool holds a candle to my tail, right? Wool is just expendable.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Among the big fluffy four, wool is the weakest![sr]That's why I recommend it with my head held high!
[k]

＠Anne
Then why don't we go with chickens?
[k]

＠Mary
We can eat 'em, use the feathers for this and that, and they seem they'd be easier to raise than sheep.
[k]

＠Anne
By the way, speaking of making a farm, the idea isn't to actually create animals out of nothing, is it?

＠Scáthach
Correct. We will need to find the first pair of animals somewhere. Then we'll have them mate and reproduce.
[k]


？1：I like how you can talk about “mating” with a straight face.
？2：I like how you can talk about[csr]“reproducing” with a straight face.

＠Scáthach
You've got a shady look in your eyes, Master,[sr]but I'll let it go.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Scáthach
At any rate, whichever it may be, the amount of wildlife we find on the island will likely make our choice.

＠Anne
What a convenient coincidence. Earlier, I found a place that had a whole brood of tasty-looking birds.
[k]

＠Mary
The more animals we get on the farm from the beginning, the better, aye? Based on that, birds are easiest, I reckon.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Mary
Besides, those birds move slowly and can't fly.[sr]We don't have to worry about them escaping.

I knew it. She's listening to our conversation and nodding her head in agreement. It's as if all she can see is the future.

What a deep gaze![sr]Could this be what is called a state of nirvana!?
