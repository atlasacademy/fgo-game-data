＠Scáthach
Hmm. So we have run into each other.
[k]

＠Scáthach
I suppose we do have a strong bond.[sr]I assume you have numerous contracted Servants...
[k]

＠Scáthach
And yet...we seem to run into each other often.[sr]It is quite moving.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Scáthach
...I am only kidding, of course.[sr]I apologize if I was getting your hopes up.
[k]

＠Scáthach
If I wander around in this form, it's only natural for us to run into each other quite often. After all, this is indeed what I was wearing on that island we were on.

Mm-hmmm. I shall make this brief.

＠Scáthach
Good. I like how direct you are.[sr]Truly, you do things the Celtic way.

I spent a great deal of time writing out runes while we were on that island. I grew quite proficient at it. So, I prepared something quite elaborate.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Accept it. With gratitude.

＠Scáthach
Check the age requirements.[sr]If you can't have it, I will drink it.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Scáthach
Well, even if you are over the age, I hope you have someone you can enjoy it with.
[k]

＠Scáthach
If not, have it alone.[sr]I don't have time to spend with you myself.
[k]

？1：L-let's enjoy it together!

＠Scáthach
You must be joking. That would make you a bad disciple. Honestly, who taught you such an unbecoming way to approach a woman?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Scáthach
That was close. You almost got me there. If you had tried that on someone else, who knows what would have happened.
[k]

＠Scáthach
If I were still a young maiden[wt 0.3][charaFace A 0] I would have fallen...no.[sr]No, no, no. That's not possible at all.

＠Scáthach
First and foremost, do you even know what you[line 3]

Oh I get it! That nasty Cú Chulainn! This is exactly the sort of trick someone like him would try.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Well then, you just earned yourself a ten-kilometer run across a sandy beach in the simulator!
[k]

＠Scáthach
[%1], don't you dare run away! I have to straighten out that crooked mind of yours once and for all!

Prepare yourself.[sr]No prey ever escapes Scáthach!
