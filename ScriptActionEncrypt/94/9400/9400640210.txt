＠Dr. Roman
Oh, I've gotta explain it from there?[sr]Right, I guess I do.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
A Reality Marble is one of the deepest secrets of magecraft.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Basically, it's magecraft that manifests the interior world of the caster, and paints over reality with what's inside their heart.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's one of the most forbidden of all techniques and just a step below True Magic. Like Unlimited Blade something-or-other.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But of course, under normal circumstances, something that crazy could never last.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
A Reality Marble is a stain on reality. The world itself detects that foreign body, that inconsistency, and moves to fix it.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So unfortunately, a Reality Marble usually only lasts a few minutes.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Did that make sense to you, [%1]?[sr]And you, cute little lady?

[charaFace D 4]
＠Illya
When I jumped to this world, for an instant I saw what looked like many castles and kingdoms...
[k]

＠Illya
They were all very clearly visible, and very large.[sr]And there was an area surrounded by a black wall...
[k]

[charaFace D 7]
＠Illya
And all of that was a single spell...[sr]A world that someone made...

Cute little lady, what's your name? Who represents you? And what are your hobbies?

＠Dr. Roman
You have a Spirit Origin like a Servant, but you're quite clearly human.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You're not a Demi-Servant or a Pseudo-Servant.[sr]And this powerful magical energy...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Could you be the owner of the Reality Marble?[sr]And would you finally tell me your name?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]

Yeah. If Mash is with you, it should be fine.[sr]You'll be able to come back.

[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]

[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We might be able to if she were one of [%1]'s contracted Servants...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Dr. Roman
And, hypothetically, even if it were possible...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That would go against our goal of guarding humanity. This is why we've spent so much effort trying not to intervene in other eras.

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
No, Doctor. Listen. She's from a parallel world, different than our own.

From the values I'm seeing, Mash isn't currently able to use her full power.

I think it's because the Reality Marble is deciding that she doesn't fully meet its conditions.
