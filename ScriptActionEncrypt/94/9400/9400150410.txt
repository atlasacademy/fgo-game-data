X! You certainly are optimistic. I'm not sure I much like the tyrannical attitude, but I admire your avariciousness!

There are so many boring Servants obsessing over their regrets in life or over their Master's purpose or whatnot.

You may be born from the tale of King Arthur, but since you're an “if” separated from it...

Hmm. So, taking a position of fantasy can be a good thing.
[k]

＠Emiya
Originally, Servants only existed in Holy Grail Wars on Earth. There are no futures for them.
[k]

＠Emiya
However, under certain conditions, for example, if they are regenerated by a Spiritron computer lifeform...
[k]

＠Emiya
...or if they remain connected with their Master after the Holy Grail War, or if they're given a new body, then things will be different.
[k]

＠Emiya
Those Servants are released from the shackles of their previous lives and become humans of that era that live now.
[k]

＠Emiya
I once heard of a happy-go-lucky Rider that was in that position...
[k]

＠Emiya
No, wait, that was an Apocrypha.[sr]Well, I guess that itself is a distant “if.”
[k]

？1：You certainly are knowledgeable, Emiya-senpai!

[charaFace C 3]
＠Emiya
Well, as a lower Heroic Spirit, you get recruited for lots of random jobs. I've simply gathered a lot of information.
[k]

＠Emiya
Think of it as nothing but idle chatter.[sr]It's just a digression.
[k]

？2：A Spiritron computer life?

[k]

＠Nero
It seems that I'm not one of those Servants, but Lily is one of them.
[k]

＠Nero
I think it's good that a Servant that dreams of the now exists instead of just dreaming of memories of their past life.
[k]

＠Nero
Basically, that means that one shapes one's own ending![sr]Suddenly, I feel that I must support Lily!
[k]

[charaFace D 3]

Shape... My own ending?[sr]So if I became King, then my destiny after that...as well?

Of course! The past has been written, the future has been decided...
[k]

The Heroic Spirits of the past can change nothing, much less those in the Throne of Heroes who know the future.
[k]

＠Nero
However, as for those in the now, they can alter the past and future!

Yes, because only those that live now can change the future!
