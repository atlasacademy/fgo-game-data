Heh. Not bad, new Saber! You guys just keep popping up like weeds, don't you?
[k]

＠X
I've been watching from afar... What's with that cool battle animation!?
[k]

＠X
A true Saber should only use a single beloved blade! Using two is so wrong... You should be ashamed of yourself!
[k]

？1：Yeah. Dual-wielding isn't a Saber style at all.

[charaFace C 1]
＠X
That is correct. I knew you were the type of Master who would understand, [%1]. Hello!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠X
Here's your New Year's present. It's red bean paste balls they sell at a station on planet Guntama.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠X
Anyway, did you hear that, newbie!?[sr]Dual-wielding is MY thing, so cut it out!
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠X
Even my self-control, which is reinforced as tightly as a plasma chain, is still about to snap!
[k]

And her skill with the sword seems like the real deal.[sr]It's a style I've never seen before. I can tell that she's a master swordsman.

...This is bad... I get the same sense from this Saber as I did from that kimono-clad street murderer!
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 2]
＠X
Either way, I'm going to attack like I'm the victor of this fight! I am Heroine X, the Space Saber!
[k]

＠X
I work to maintain the balance of the Servant universe by defeating the ever growing number of Sabers! All things must be perfectly in balance!
[k]

Taste my ever-so-flashy Saber Ninja Technique!

Yes, it's a demonic technique some traveler taught to the King of Knights[line 2]after the latter crossed the sea by mistake and got lost on Mt. Katsuragi.
[k]

＠Sukeroku
Though extraordinarily powerful, it's a cursed technique that becomes almost useless once its user joins your side.
[k]

＠Sukeroku
I never thought such a technique would ever get implemented... I mean, would actually exist!

Heh. I may not have Nameless Red or Babbagen with me this time, but I do have barbaric techniques that can only be used alone!
[k]

＠X
Get ready, dual-wielder! And be careful, [%1]!
[k]

＠X
Don't underestimate me just because it's New Year's! I'm kind of seriously strong right now!
