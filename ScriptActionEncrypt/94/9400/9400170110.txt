The sun is shining, the little birds are chirping at one another... such a wonderful morning...but not really.

I am certain that the doom of Chaldea will be here.[sr]The world will burn to ashes.

Yet still, you stand to face it. For the ceaseless tomorrows, for the ever-coming tomorrows.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Ah, yes. Now I remember.[sr]It seems you have some degree of resistance.
[k]

＠Mash
Then I have no choice but to do this. I'm sorry.[sr]To be honest, I want you to be just the way you are.
[k]

＠Mash
...I'm...sorry.

[charaFace A 4]

Yes, you're right...[sr]Even though this is the end of time, you...

...You have not shown weakness in your mind.[sr]Even now, you can think of others...

＠Mash
A beautiful heart. A strong heart.[sr]I believe that was once what I loved.

...I'm sorry, now...for just a short while,[sr]I will touch your lips. With these fingertips.

The way things are... There are still traces from the Fourth Era that are yet to be repaired.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Demonic Fog. Life-stealing death mists that are packed with magical energy. Like the atmosphere during the Age of the Gods.
[k]

＠Mash
If it's the end of the 19th century AD... The atmosphere should be close to that of 20th century Tokyo...

However, you might call this a tragedy... As this is the last island left with ancient mystics...

Before my flames burn you to ashes, allow me to test you. Allow me to learn what kind of person you are.
