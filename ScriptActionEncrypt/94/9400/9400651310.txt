Even in a late-stage magical girl world like this, someone has to take a stand and save it.

＠Fake Okita
And I have responded to the call.[sr]Take a good look, world! I am the MIBU WOLF!
[k]

＠Fake Okita
Which means I have awakened to the magical girl vibes, becoming First Unit Captain of the Magical Shinsengumi.

[k]

＠Fake Okita
It's like a cheap version of a Shadow Servant (Shadvant for short)! This is not what I signed up for!
