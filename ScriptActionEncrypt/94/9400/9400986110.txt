？1：Steak!?

Yeah. Emiya made the side dishes, but I cooked the meat.

？1：Delicious!

[charaFace A 1]

＠Beowulf
Yeah, eat up. Glad I hunted it down!
[k]

？2：My taste buds have awakened!

[charaFace A 1]

＠Beowulf
Well I just cooked the meat, and Boudica made the sauce.
[k]

？！

＠Beowulf
I like the way you eat.
[k]

？1：What part of the animal is this?
？！


＠Beowulf
It's the throat. That animal breathes fire through its mouth, so the throat is most used part of its body. Delicious!
[k]

？1：...What did you just say?

？2：...What kind of meat is this?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Beowulf
Hm?
[k]

＠Beowulf
Dragons breathe fire. That's why their throats go through a lot, and it makes them delicious.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Beowulf
Seeing the happy look on your face makes all that work worthwhile!
[k]

？1：Well...
？2：Guess it's okay since it's delicious!
？！

＠Beowulf
Yeah, eat up! Eat up!
