Senpai. Don't you think it's about time that we answered the question that's on everyone's mind?
[k]

？1：Oh, you mean about the spacecraft parts.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
That's right. I wasn't going to say anything, but it looks like this is going to take a while.
[k]

？2：Ah, you mean about who X really is.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I think that's something we should avoid for now.[sr]It could cause things to get worse with her.

What? Do you have a question for me? Since we've reached a break in Lily's training, go right ahead.

＠Mash
Okay, for my first question,[sr]I'm all right with gathering Altrium...
[k]

＠Mash
...but how is it that you'll be able to power up Lily with the Altrium we gather?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠X
Right, I didn't explain how that works, did I?
[k]

＠X
This is common sense throughout the entire milky way.[sr]Altrium is a newly discovered almighty energy particle.
[k]

＠X
My spacecraft is powered by Altrium. Also, inside my spacecraft, the Spirit Origin Enhancement Device[line 3]
[k]

＠X
A capsule known as “Adam Kadmon.”
[k]

＠X
When this device is fed enough Altrium, Lily can be physically enhanced.
[k]

？1：A Spirit Origin Enhancement Device?

In the Hebrew language, it means “doll” or “human”...[sr]But with a negative connotation...
[k]

＠Mash
They say it is a very immoral thing...[sr]I guess you could say it's much like Paracelsus...

Adam Kadmon is a device that creates an exact Spirit Origin copy based on the Spirit Origin's information.
[k]

？1：So you can just print off copies of the same Heroic Spirit!?

But why do the monsters that are attacking carry these parts? They look like nothing more than junk[line 3]

I've had quite enough of the beauties I've gathered.[sr]They only have eyes for my huge treasure. I'm serious.

Now I will live in a lovely home with my new sexy wife, a pool in the backyard... I'll go fishing on holidays...[sr]Oh, what a dream...

Oh, but the one in the tacky blue track suit,[sr]she's not anywhere near my strike zone.

Who was it that liked pretty young girls? Was it Rackam?[sr]He was pretty sad when Mary deceived him.

[charaFace B 1]

What's this? The General's getting excited![sr]Could it be that the tacky blue track suit is his fetish?

Not bad for an art connoisseur... Not! Wah-hah-hah! When the General is like this, he really is quite frightening!

You there in the tacky track suit, take my advice and make a run for it. It just might save you, you kno... Whoa!

So, instead I invited the General... Who knew that he'd be defeated before he could even draw his sword...
[k]

＠Teach
Oh well, I didn't expect anything from him anyway.[sr]I thought he could at least be a shield... For I am kind...
[k]

＠Teach
But this is unacceptable... There's not even a cooling-off period... A huge loss to Blackbeard...
