They are so happy... Senpai, it was worth building it.

？1：I'm glad they're happy.
？2：Is it something to be so giddy about?
？！

＠Mary
Master, you may not think a faucet dispensing water is anything special...
[k]

＠Anne
But for those of us that experienced water shortages, this is nothing short of a miracle.
[k]

＠Anne
Hope that human beings won't have to worry about water anymore.

...Even before the world was incinerated, there were regions that still suffered from water shortages.
[k]

＠Mash
Though I feel that the existence of faucets isn't really relevant to water shortages on a ship...
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I suppose this is a symbol of the ability of modern civilization to manage water.
[k]

＠Mash
Now that I think about it, it is amazing how water comes out just like that.

Hold it right there![sr]I want to confirm something you mentioned earlier!

Uh-oh, Altria is shouting in excitement! I do not understand why, although I do suppose Japanese dashi broth can be dispensed from a faucet.

＠Altria
I am familiar with the splendor of udon.[sr]It has a simple but deep flavor.
[k]

＠Altria
Soft, chewy noodles in a painstakingly prepared soup...it's the epitome of exquisite yet simple-looking cuisine!
[k]


？1：Cold udon's tasty too

[charaFace B 1]
＠Altria
Oh, the dish where the noodles aren't submerged in the soup? Yes, that's also tasty... Truly tasty. The sensation you get when they pass through your throat is accentuated in it.
[k]


？2：Fried udon's tasty too.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Altria
The one where the noodles are pan-fried? Yes, that's also tasty... Truly tasty. The aroma is to die for!
[k]


？！

[charaFace B 5]
＠Altria
...Never mind the noodles! We are talking about this broth coming out of the faucet!
[k]

＠Altria
Now let me check!
[k]


？1：You can't do that unless you go to UDON country...

The king can be so demanding. Just turning on a faucet yields fresh water. Isn't that enough?
[k]

＠Mary
Indeed. Just turn the faucet on and watch it flow.[sr](Gulp gulp)
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Mary
Hmm, delicious! This has motivated me to gather more fresh water!
[k]

＠Mary
Thanks, Master!
