It appears that stick was doing its best impression of her.

[charaShake B 0.07 0 8 1.0]
＠Ruby
It was already breaking down, perhaps from the mental strain of that impression? Still, copying a humanoid form is impressive.

It's possible, within this odd space!

At any rate, I'm relieved to know she wasn't a real Servant.

＠Mash
Aside from the fact that she was hostile towards us, we didn't really figure out anything.
[k]

？1：That's more on her than on us...

It would be nice to have an enemy we can communicate with... Is that a strange thing to ask?

Yes. It did feel like she was bursting with dreams.[sr]Just not hope.

Besides, her voice sounded familiar to me for some reason...

Oops, that's a meta-statement disguised as foreshadowing! If only Chloe was here, it would've been even more confusing.

At any rate, I don't think that one was the last fake Servant...!
