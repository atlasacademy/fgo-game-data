Such a height is a mild feat for me. Even without a rope and harness, such a descent is ease itself.
[k]

＠Tristan
...Indeed. Leaping from a spire and gliding is a trifling thing for a Knight of the Round Table such as myself.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Tristan
The problem, of course, is that the descent is far easier than the ascent. I am no bird, and so cannot fly.
[k]

[charaFace C 7]
＠Tristan
Fortunately, you all have a way around that problem, don't you? I hope it would not be imposing to request to be allowed to employ that means with you.

The route to the planetarium is still open, and I'm sure the Seraphix personnel are anxious to get the heck out of here.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
...We can't let Arnold in that room, though. He'll self-destruct from all the inappropriate desires it's bound to unleash in him.

Much as I wish you could head up there and knock some sense into that jerk, it's probably a lost cause.

Hello there, Senpai. Oh, and all you other traitors too.

Are you enjoying yourselves down here? You've been gone so long I was beginning to wonder if you'd forgotten about little old me.
[k]

[charaFace D 11]
＠BB
Sorry to say I haven't forgotten about you, though!

＠BB
I show up when you least want me to.[sr]I'm like a joker during a game of old maid.

And like the filthy cockroaches scuttling around my proverbial kitchen that you are, I'll just have to squish YOU with my slippers!

I won't even break the rules, either. For I was the AI called upon to manage the Holy Grail War.
[k]

＠BB
And that means, I play the game fair and square. No matter how much of a mistake this version of SE.RA.PH has turned out to be.
[k]

？1：(Fair and square...?)
？2：(Wait a second. That would mean...)

？！

Uh oh! I think I gave you too big of a hint there![sr]But no matter. No more Ms. Nice AI!
[k]

[charaFace D 12]
＠BB
Did you really think I'd just teleport you back up to the top? Au contraire! I'm sending you even further down! Down to SE.RA.PH's deepest depths!
[k]

＠BB
...Now then. SE.RA.PH will reach the bottom of the sea in just five and a half hours, or three minutes and change on the outside.
[k]

＠BB
That means you don't have enough time to turn the tables, or even climb back up, for that matter.
