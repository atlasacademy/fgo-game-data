Hmm. Hm hm.

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
So you want me to disguise myself as Medb, and trick that lucha lady into turning off the Prison Field, huh?

Thanks for agreeing to help us so readily!
[k]

＠Sanzang
The Buddha has long taught us to help others. When you do something nice for others, something nice comes back to you. That is the whole basis of “one good turn deserves another” you know!

I never said I'd help you all out for nothing. If you want a gangster like me to take out a villain, you gotta at least buy me a drink.
[k]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
But since you're a monk, we're all in a prison, and there's no alcohol to go around...I want you guys to join me in something else I can enjoy!

I may be able to become anyone else, but that also means if I'm not careful, I might end up forgetting who I am.
[k]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
So that's why I wanna mix it up a bit with you all in this form. You don't mind, right? C'mon, let's do it!
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
Besides...I'm not totally satisfied with our earlier duels. I still haven't seen anything close to what you're truly capable of.
[k]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
Especially you.[sr]I wanna see more of that weird spinning top move!
[k]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
I bet it'd be a big hit with the kids if I learned it myself, y'know? You'd be surprised how important it is for someone like me to be popular with the kids[line 2]

On top of such crude words, you do not wear a shirt, and you're covered in tattoos... Yes, I'm certain now. You are...a delinquent!

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
A scantily-dressed delinquent!
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable![sr]This won't do at all.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I am the prefect, and will not let this transgression stand!

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
If Master or Kintoki were to go around imitating your unwholesome way of life, I don't know what I would do!
[k]

[charaFace E 2]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Your offense is different than those who are wearing swimsuits, but no less grave. We shall begin with a lecture! Go sit in the corner right now!
