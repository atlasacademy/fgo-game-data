＠Mash
Is this the ash tree you planted?[sr]Is something the matter?
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Scáthach
Well, just wait a bit.[sr]Let's try to make a new spear with it.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
A spear...?
[k]

＠Scáthach
Gáe Bolg was made from the bones of a sea monster.[sr]It would be difficult to replicate that on this island.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Scáthach
But I can make something that's extremely similar using the power of my runes.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
With this ash tree?
[k]

＠Scáthach
Ash trees are descendants of the Norse world tree, Yggdrasil. And Yggdrasil is where the runes themselves come from.
[k]

＠Scáthach
So if I borrow as much power as possible from this ash tree, then use my runes...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
You'll have more Gáe Bolgs?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Scáthach
Exactly![sr]One spear per ash tree!
[k]

＠Scáthach
Even from a non-crafter like myself, they should still be formidable. Enough to withstand the strain as a Noble Phantasm.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
Does that mean...?
[k]

＠Scáthach
That's right. An increase in Noble Phantasm strength.
[k]

＠Scáthach
...Anyway, I'll be pouring my heart and soul into this work, and in the meantime, I'd like you guys to stand guard.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Uh, stand guard?
[k]

＠Scáthach
I'll be crafting this spear all day and all night. The latter is most likely when those demon boars will show up.
