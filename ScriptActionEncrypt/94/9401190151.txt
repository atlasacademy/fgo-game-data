Hehehe. Hehehehe![sr]That slot machine is this episode's showcase feature!
[k]

＠BB
You know how there are strong Servants, weak Servants, lucky Masters, and unlucky Masters?
[k]

＠BB
Well, thanks to this evil little roulette, everyone can now equally relish the fear that they might lose their next battle!
[k]

＠BB
I call it: “BB's Terrible Slot Machine”!
[k]

？1：Are you kidding me!?
？2：Why would you even do that!?

？！

＠BB
Hey, showbiz is relentless. You can't expect audiences to be satisfied with the same old thing forever.
[k]

＠BB
Oh, Senpai! You're so weak and fragile...and dumb! For someone with all those difficulties to get this far and not be praised for it... I mean, really!
[k]

＠BB
That's why I came up with this little treat: to make sure you get your due for succeeding in spite of being you! So no complaining, 'kay?

This is where the game really begins!
[k]

＠BB
Will SE.RA.PH continue to sink, taking everyone down with it!? It's time for...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠BB
The Great Deep-Sea Escape Game!☆ Will YOU be the Master to walk away with the Holy Grail!?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠BB
I know it's a rip-off of the Moon Holy Grail War, but try not to let that spoil your fun, 'kay?
[k]

＠BB
This game is a battle to the death between no less than 128 Servants.
[k]

＠BB
To win, you need to either uncover the truth behind SE.RA.PH, or be the last Servant standing.
[k]

＠BB
Once either of these victory conditions has been met, you'll all be free to go.
[k]

＠BB
Go ahead and pick whichever one you like♡
[k]

＠BB
As the game master, I'll just be over here watching you all toil away regardless.

[charaFace D 11]
＠BB
So before I knew it, I found myself coming here to do some bug-squashing.
[k]

＠BB
I don't need anyone here who doesn't appreciate my game, so I thought I might as well squish 'em now.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠BB
But I guess it would be kind of silly to go and kill them myself after I went to all the trouble of bringing them here, huh. Oops!

Besides, I'm still a Sentinel. You shouldn't have any problem with how I spend my time as long as I fulfill my ultimate role, right?

＠BB
I feel better now that I've had a little fun anyway, so I'll go ahead and wait for you in the boss room.
[k]

＠BB
Oh, and if you're going to focus on exploring instead of fighting, let me give you some advice.
[k]

＠BB
As the admin, I've locked down a number of SE.RA.PH's passageways.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠BB
Buuut, if you want to bribe me, I'd be happy to open them up for you without telling the other players!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠BB
Still, you might not want to explore TOO much, you know? The further you go, the stronger the attack programs will get.
[k]

＠BB
Oh, and you'll also start running into Sentinels[line 2]special Servants tasked with guarding SE.RA.PH.
[k]

？1：Sentinels...?

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠BB
Yup! I'm the producer for this battle arena, so I made sure CCC is synonymous with emotional barriers and Sentinels!
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠BB
SE.RA.PH is what you'd get if you took somebody's mind and turned it into a labyrinth. Put another way, it's like the digital embodiment of humanity's inner world.
[k]

＠BB
It used to also be called The Sakura Labyrinth, but that's a story for another exposition dump.
[k]

＠BB
Basically, there's no program in the world that's more complicated, weird, and downright messed up than a human mind.
[k]

＠BB
The Sakura Labyrinth and those Sentinels turn these inherently irrational structures into defense mechanisms.
[k]

＠BB
Each Sentinel is given a powerful passive skill called a Karmaphage, or KP for short.
[k]

＠BB
KPs make Sentinels all but impossible to beat with normal Servants, so I'd avoid them if I were you.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠BB
Of course, the Sentinels will also try to stop you from investigating SE.RA.PH, so you might want to try and beat them anyway?
[k]

＠BB
There's five Sentinels all together, and each one guards a different fifth of SE.RA.PH!
[k]

＠BB
So make sure you know what you're in for when moving to a new area, 'kay?♡
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠BB
Okay, that's all for now. BB, out☆
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠BB
Oh, right, I almost forgot. Back to life with you☆

When I saw you'd gone and maxed yourself out, I kind of got annoyed and ended up draining you...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

But thanks to that, I got a little level-up myself!

Let me make a little correction to something that[sr]Da Vinci Servant said back at Chaldea.
[k]

＠BB
It may be difficult to Rayshift to the future, but it isn't inherently impossible.
[k]

＠BB
So why did she say it was?
[k]

＠BB
Because all of you at Chaldea aren't capable of Rayshifting past 2019.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠BB
Anyway, that doesn't have anything to do with this current turn of events, so don't worry about it. What I WOULD worry about is finding a way to survive, so...good luck with that, 'kay?
