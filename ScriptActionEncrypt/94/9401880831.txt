Why!?[sr]Why is this woman able to use my Authority so well!?

You were the only one fixated on that Authority.[sr]But there's hardly any sense pointing that out now.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
You are the malice that was born from your battle with Ereshkigal, so you don't know what happened afterward.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
Nergal was an arrogant god, but that arrogance was tinged with generosity.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
Nergal did not begrudgingly submit to his victor.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
He willingly handed over his Authority to the goddess who defeated him, as a friendly gesture of respect.
[k]


＠Dumuzid
But you never knew that, because you were left behind and forgotten.

You've been that way since the Age of Gods, which is also why you never had many friends.

At any rate, we're running out of time faster than a sheep loses its flavor.

＠Dumuzid
In a few minutes, this descent into the underworld will be over. And with time to spare before Christmas, too!
[k]

＠Dumuzid
Once the date rolls over to December 24,[sr]we shall all go back to our own times.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
Chaldea will return to December of 2019, and the underworld will return to December one year prior.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
Of course, the time difference won't matter if you choose to stay here, but if you did...

True, even after all your hard work, you won't be leaving with a reward from Ereshkigal...

No, wait. Messing up is one thing,[sr]but if I embarrass myself as much as Ishtar did...

No... Even if I did disappear, I thought your world would be just fine without me.

I am Dumuzid. I don't take sides. Yes, Ereshkigal may have worked me to the bone, and punished me relentlessly...

＠Dumuzid
...but I still owe her a debt.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
And, yes, Ishtar made my life hell...but I don't exactly hate her.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
I don't really see a problem with the fact that I once held a, uh, Goddess Downfall Appreciation Sale...
[k]

＠Dumuzid
...and so I can't really blame Ishtar for making me take her place.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
Yes, I may have experienced great pain, and begged and pleaded for mercy, but I don't bear them any ill will.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
That's just how we gods think.[sr]What matters is that it all works out in the end.

And this turned out very much to my liking.[sr]Though it is a shame that I wasn't able to save Nergal.
