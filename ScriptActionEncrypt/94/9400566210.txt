＠Kiyohime
Now we finally have the chance to take a walk together alone. Let's have a good, long talk, okay?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
We'll talk about our plans for the future, and the place where we'll create our first memories, and...
[k]

？1：Oh, that's right! Why are you a Lancer?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Kiyohime
...I see. Our future together is very important, so you'd rather we talk about that later? You sure know how to leave a girl hanging, Master.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Yes, I'm overjoyed to know that you're interested in me for who I am.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
During my era, the naginata was a new weapon. But, fortunately, my home was well-off, so I learned to use it for self-protection.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Also, I'm not dressed in my usual garments.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Kiyohime
I thought that if I carried something different than normal, I could get your heart to race, Master.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
A swimsuit is graceful, and nothing says “graceful” more than a naginata. So, Master, your heart IS racing, isn't it?
[k]

？1：Yep. (Because of the reach she has with that thing.)
？2：Yes. (Because of how deadly that thing seems.)
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Kiyohime
You know...what I hate, don't you?[sr]So are you telling the truth?
[k]


？1：Of course. (Having her behind me makes my heart race.)
？2：Yes. (Catching her in my periphery makes my heart race.)
？！

[charaFace A 3]
＠Kiyohime
Hehehe. Being here with you, wearing a different outfit... It makes me so happy.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Makes my heart...beat fast...

Oh, look, a river. The current in the middle is fast, but here it's calm and beautiful.

Since we have swimsuits on, why don't we both go for a dip, Master?
[k]

？！

I never used to be. But, since our fateful meeting, I've been[line 3]Huh?

It doesn't appear to have noticed us yet.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
It looks... like it's on its way back to its den.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
We've had to clean up several poisonous swamps already. Could this be another one?
[k]


？1：For the sake of the island's wildlife, we can't ignore it.
？2：For the sake of the boar piglets, we can't ignore it.
？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Kiyohime
You are so considerate, Master... You are exactly right.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Kiyohime
But what should we do? It might disappear somewhere if we don't keep our eyes on it.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
If we lose sight of it, we have no guarantee that the boar piglets will find it.
[k]

？1：At any rate, let's follow it,
？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Kiyohime
But...that means we have to cross this river.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
If we jump over, the boar will notice us.[sr]We must swim across it stealthily.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
The current becomes much faster in the middle.[sr]You're in danger of being washed away, Master...
[k]


？1：Can you give me a hand?
？2：I'd like you to assist me.
？！

[charaFace A 3]
＠Kiyohime
Oh... Ooh! Of course! Of course!
[k]

＠Kiyohime
When we looked at each other just now, I understood. That confirmed it.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
You have faith in me!
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Our hearts are bound together. There is nothing to fear with trust and love like ours.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Kiyohime
Now... Hold my hand, Master, and don't ever let go.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
I mean, naturally, I have no intention of letting go of you either...for all eternity... Hehehe. Just kidding.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
All right, let us begin...

Are you all right?[sr]How was my swimming?

？1：The way your body writhed...was like a snake.
？2：The way your body writhed...was like a mermaid.

Oh my. Me, as beautiful as a mermaid?[sr]You're too generous...

As I was saying earlier, I never used to be able to swim.

But when I was fervently chasing after Anchin, I suddenly found myself slithering across the Hidaka River...
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Somehow I was able to swim!

...We did it, Master. That demon boar doesn't look like it will be moving for a while.

＠Kiyohime
Let's remember this location and hurry back to camp. If we grab everyone quickly, I think we can make it back in time.

[charaFace A 2]
＠Kiyohime
Then... you'll have front-row seats to observe me as I gracefully put my naginata to use.
