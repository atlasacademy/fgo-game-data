＠BB
That's right! Thanks for the sultry encore!
[k]

＠BB
I knew you wouldn't disappoint when it came to the reaction shot, Senpai! That whole “Huh!? The last boss!?” thing you had going on was perfect!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠BB
But, it still makes me sad.
[k]

＠BB
I wish I didn't have to punish you for being such a naughty [&boy:girl], [%1].
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠BB
But there's nothing for it now, is there?
[k]

＠BB
It's your fault for taking forever to get through the very first area, after all.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Meltryllis
What are you up to, BB? Aren't you the one breaking the rules by showing up here in person?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Shouldn't the last boss be holed up in the innermost chamber watching from a monitor or something?

And in general, I intend to do just that. But it's no fun following the rules ALL the time, now is it?
[k]

＠BB
Still, a Master with more than one Servant?
[k]

＠BB
That's the one thing I'll never, ever stand for!

(Master, get behind me. This could be our chance to settle this here and now.)

(Now that the source of our troubles has appeared before us, I shall do my utmost to capture her!)
[k]

？1：(...Do it, Gawain!)
[charaFace C 0]
＠Gawain
As you wish. I do not yet know what she is capable of, so I shall begin by testing her!

What's this, Senpai!? Who are you gazing at with such passion!? Whatever could you be talking about!?
[k]

？！

＠BB
Just kidding! You didn't really think it was going to be that easy, did you? Neither battle nor dialogue has any effect on me, after all!
[k]

＠BB
Why, you ask? Why is that, you ask!?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠BB
Because nothing happens here on SE.RA.PH unless I want it to happen!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
Don't worry, I'll give you all a personal hard-knocks style lesson to show you what I mean. Trust me, it'll get you right in the Spirit Origins.
[k]

＠BB
You're up, Matcha. Go ahead and show them your brand spanking new animations.

Oh... Oh gosh, Matcha, I didn't realize you thought so highly of yourself. I'm sorry...
[k]

＠BB
All this time, I've been thinking of you as a disposable pocket warmer, or a worn-out hanky...
[k]

＠BB
I had no idea you dreamed of becoming a popular character...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠BB
Okay then, next time, instead of the rabbit trick, I'll throw a cloth over you and use you to practice my Human Pincushion act!

Sheesh. Just my luck that I'd run into an AI that's gone super-rogue...

Well gosh, that's awfully kind of you to form a contract with a half-assed Heroic Spirit like me. It says...uh...a lot about you.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Robin Hood
But, we're on opposing sides here, so I'm still going to do my best to try and kill you.

Wow, look at you, Matcha! Not even an ounce of sympathy for an old acquaintance! [charaFace A 1]I love it!☆
[k]

＠BB
In fact, there's nothing I like better than that kind of ruthlessness. So...[charaFace A 13][bgmStop BGM_EVENT_52 0.7]make sure you don't hold back in any way, shape, or form. Got it?
[k]

＠BB
'Cause if I smell even a whiff of betrayal from you, it'll be off to the trash compactor with you.
[k]

＠BB
And I'm sure you don't want to be tossed into the deep sea after being squished into a cube, now do you?

＠Robin Hood
All right, bring it on, Chaldea Servant.

＠Robin Hood
I don't know what things are like on the outside, but this here is SE.RA.PH. Down in this digital ocean, rules are everything.

[charaFace D 2]
＠Robin Hood
You might have a first-class Spirit Origin, but that doesn't mean you'll be able to make full use of it here. Come on: I'll show you what I'm talking about firsthand!
