Guh... You say that like it's no big deal, Shuten!

You can't do it? Then we'll just give up. I just thought maybe my dear Ibaraki would be able to do something about this situation...

[charaFace G 2]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
I-I-I-I didn't say that![sr]There's no way I would disappoint you!

With my skills, I can get us out of any predicament with ease! Grab on to me, Shuten!

If even a single insect remains, they will breed without limit. I will go and crush them.

Just like the boss said, Boss Raikou...[sr]I guess I can't call you both that, huh?

＠Sakata Kintoki
Using “boss” for both of you is just lame. It's a bit old-fashioned now, but can I call you Lord Raikou instead?

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...I guess I have no choice. Then, my Kintoki, will you give your mother your support as I chase after them alone?
[k]

[charaTalk E]

My support? Well, yeah... Huh? What the!?

Quit squirming. Are you that rebellious now? ...Ahh, now I see. You're worried about what your other boss will think.

Anyone would be embarrassed at this![sr]This isn't Parents' Day!

And aren't you forgetting something, Lord Raikou? Those two are getting away the longer you're like this!
[k]

[charaTalk E]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Oh, that's right. It is sad to part, but I must be going.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
[line 2]Until we meet again, everyone.[sr]Please take care of my Kintoki.

We have orders to find out who the mastermind is that created this island.

We'll keep those two at the back of our minds while we continue to move ahead with what we must do, Master.
