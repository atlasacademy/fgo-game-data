Did you see that, Senpai? ...When Amadeus' mask[sr]slipped off, it hit Sanson on the back of the head...
[k]

＠Mash
...And instantly knocked him out... Is that level of coordination only possible because they've known each other for years?

Don't worry about that, Mash.[sr]If Sanson was awake this discussion would take longer.

＠Marie
Yes, as we were fighting, somewhat.[sr]There's a lot to talk about, but first, here.

＠Marie
You can have these wonderful confections back.[sr]We had a small amount. I'm sorry.

＠Mash
No, as long we have them back, it's okay.[sr]We were going to give these equally to everyone...

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Huh? Um...is this all? You were saying there were three tons worth a moment ago...

That was at the start.[sr]I did load up the carriage, but...
[k]

＠Marie
We ran into a group of three people passing by,[sr]and gave them most of the dumplings as a sign of friendship.

What?![sr]You gave them almost three tons worth?

＠Marie
Of course. When you think about it, no matter how good they are, you can't eat three tons, can you?

Yes, that's right. I would've preferred you to think about that sooner, though.

They said they were going to pray near the waters of[sr]Marseille. If you hurry, you might catch them.
