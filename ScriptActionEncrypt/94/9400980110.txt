...I see. No wonder the people are getting excited.
[k]

＠Caesar
What an interesting event this era has. It's not bad. I think I even like it.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Caesar
Gifts are good. Dull as offerings are, gifts given with some genuine thought are nice...
[k]

＠Caesar
Even I showered those I loved in thoughtful gifts.
[k]

＠Caesar
And I received many gifts in kind. The gift of love, of course! Behold my glorious figure! Behold all the well-deserved affection it has received!

＠Caesar
I think it was called pharaoh cuisine.[sr]All the dishes she made were so delicious...
[k]

＠Caesar
Every time I traveled to Alexandria, I was showered with love, and in turn, there was more of me to love!
[k]

＠Caesar
Ah, memories...
[k]

？1：Then by all means, accumulate more!
？2：It's not pharaoh cuisine, but have some chocolates!

Hmmm, it's sweet. Very sweet. This is sure to melt the heart... Just like one's first romance.
[k]

＠Caesar
I enjoy its faint bitterness too. Accept my gratitude, Master. Thanks to you, there is even more of me to love.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Caesar
I must reciprocate love with love![sr]Look forward to it!
