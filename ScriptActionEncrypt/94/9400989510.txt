＠Karna
Hm. [%1]? Sorry. I didn't notice you.[sr]I was a bit distracted.
[k]

＠Karna
Good morning. It's a wonderful morning.[sr]After all, I saw you first thing in the morning.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Karna
...No, this must be divine assistance. I feel like I could confide in you about my...rather strange experience.
[k]

＠Karna
Listen, [%1].[sr]I want you to stay calm and hear this.
[k]

＠Karna
I have had many strange encounters today.[sr]It's all been about offerings.
[k]

＠Karna
Without reason, and from Chaldean staff that I have no acquaintance with, many have approached me to give me chocolates.
[k]

＠Karna
Can you believe that? This has happened five times already. Not only that...
[k]

＠Karna
Rama, Geronimo, Robin Hood, Beowulf, and Li Shuwen. They have all had similar experiences.
[k]

＠Karna
Ah, and for some reason, Edison was crying like a baby while Helena handed him chocolates.
[k]

＠Karna
Normally, one should happily accept a gift... But I'm no Arjuna, so there is no reason for anyone to give me gifts.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Karna
And that manly Edison was bawling. Could this possibly be a sign of an impending terror or new enemy?
[k]

？1：Edison! (Cry with him)
？2：(Explain Valentine's Day)

Valentine's Day! I see.[sr]I did hear about this interesting custom...
[k]

＠Karna
But I did not know today was that day.[sr]A woman who is knowledgeable of events...
[k]

＠Karna
..taught me to say, “This event doesn't concern me!”[sr]But I had completely forgotten about that.
[k]

＠Karna
I have done a terrible thing...
[k]

＠Karna
I told them that I “don't require it, nor do I have anything to give back.”
[k]

？1：Actually, I have something for you, too.
？2：Just take it, you!

Yes. I made them with what I had lying around, but they turned out better than expected.
[k]

＠Karna
I had Da Vinci help me, but I still consider them something I made with my own hands.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Karna
...No. I did consider handing it to you on the spot, but I thought you wouldn't appreciate it as-is.
[k]

＠Karna
I re-molded it thinking of you. Know that I am a man who is at least considerate in that respect.
[k]

？1：(He looks so smug...!)

[charaFace A 3]
＠Karna
...Do I look like that? To be honest, you're right, I was full of pride.
[k]

＠Karna
It would please me greatly to see you wear them. Perhaps some time when it is just the two of us.
[k]

？2：Thank you, Karna.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Karna
Ah, thank you, [%1]. I shall never forget this feeling of happiness I experienced today.
[k]

＠Karna
It truly is an immortal chocolate.[sr]Not even the sun itself could melt this sweet feeling.
