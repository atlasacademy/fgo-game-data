Seven against seven.[sr]Finally, at long last, they are all gathered.
[k]

＠
No Ruler has been summoned here. This Great Holy Grail War will have no effect on the world.
[k]

＠
The “other” Ruler is not here either.[sr]He is already dead.
[k]

＠
He will never be sent here as a new Ruler now.
[k]

＠
In which case, this tiny, insignificant world that miraculously managed to remain...is mine.
[k]

＠
Yes, this is my world now.[sr]It belongs to no one else.
[k]

＠
So I will repeat the cycle as many times as it takes. I will recreate the miracle, and this time I will ascend to glory.
[k]

＠
In the end, that is all I can do, all I can become.[sr]And so, I have no choice but to proceed.

Thou dost seem perhaps TOO accustomed to this sort of thing.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
Of course, that must be exactly why it was thee,[sr]among all, who was summoned here.
[k]

[k]

＠Evil Dragon
It was incredibly arrogant of me to call you[sr]here out of nowhere and ask you to fight.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
Don't worry about it. I'll figure something else out.[sr]I'm terribly sorry to have bothered you like this.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
...Uh, first off, let me explain[sr]where you are right now.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
This is the Reverse Side of the World. Hmm, or maybe a hidden place on “the other side,” so to speak, is more accurate?
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
Basically, you can think of it as a mythical[sr]land and the home of magical beasts.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
Your world, the human world,[sr]is built on human laws.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
...This world, however,[sr]is entirely removed from those laws.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
This may be difficult to understand, but your world came to exist once humanity had covered the entire planet, like a cloth.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
But before that could happen,[sr]beings called Phantasmals fled here.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
Of course, I hear that Phantasmals have been showing up in your world again as well, now that humanity is in such disorder.
[k]

？1：Sorry to interrupt, but...you mean like wyverns?

＠Evil Dragon
Yes, that's right.
[k]

？2：Phantasmals? Like what?

＠Evil Dragon
Wyverns, bicorns, chimeras...[sr]Creatures like that.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
They're supposed to live here, in this world, though. They shouldn't be visiting yours as though it were some sort of café.
[k]

？！

＠Evil Dragon
Now, this land is in grave danger,[sr]thanks to the Greater Grail I brought here.
[k]

？1：Greater Grail...?
？2：As in, the one that was in Fuyuki...?
？！

＠Evil Dragon
You really DO know your stuff.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
I don't know what happened in your world, but in mine,[sr]I had no choice but to bring the Greater Grail here to the Reverse Side.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
Otherwise it would have caused[sr]all kinds of problems, you see.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
There was a problem, though. A certain Noble Phantasm partially destroyed the Greater Grail.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
Even so, things were fine until now...
[k]


＠Evil Dragon
...but then, even though I didn't do anything,[sr]it just kind of...broke. On its own.
[k]

？1：Suuure it did.



＠Evil Dragon
No, really, I didn't do anything.[sr]I'm sure I didn't...
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
I may have a few gaps in my memory, but I'm fairly certain nothing happened during those gaps.
[k]

？2：You expect me to believe that!?


＠Evil Dragon
...I mean...I don't think I did, anyway.[sr]I'll admit my memory is a little hazy, but even so...
[k]

？！

＠Evil Dragon
A-at any rate, the real problem...
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_2 1.5]

＠Evil Dragon
...is that a Holy Grail War is taking[sr]place inside the damaged Greater Grail.
[k]

？1：Did you say...a Holy Grail War...?
？！

[bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]

＠Evil Dragon
Yup.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
A miniature war between Servants is being waged inside the very Greater Grail they want to control.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
I haven't actually seen any of the battles myself, but I know how many there have been. Just looking at the numbers here, it's been over ten thousand now.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
At first there were only two Servants. By the 567th Holy Grail War, there were four, and by the 2313th, there were seven.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
...That was when my control of the[sr]Greater Grail started to waver.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
That is to say, someone is trying to take over the Greater Grail and use it for themselves.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
If something isn't done, the Greater Grail will continue to spin out of control until it's completely destroyed.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
And that would be...a problem.
[k]

？1：Problem?
？！

＠Evil Dragon
Yes, a big problem. You see, this Greater Grail[sr]isn't mine. I'm just holding on to it.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
I don't have any right to use it myself,[sr]and I can't let anyone else use it either.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
I have to take good care of it.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
If the Greater Grail went out of control, that would cause a great deal of trouble for all the Demonic Beasts who live here...
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
It's even possible that an event like that, or its aftermath, could damage one of the anchors that holds the world together.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
If the cloth[line 2]or texture, if you like[line 2]is torn, the laws of physics will be turned on their heads, and the Age of Gods will end up mixing with modern times.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
And that...wouldn't end well for anybody. Humans and Demonic Beasts would only end up hurting each other.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
So I'm asking you now:[sr]Will you help me save this world?
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 0.7]

？1：...Okay, I'll give it a shot.

[bgm BGM_EVENT_4 0.1]

We'll need to dive into the domain[sr]within the Greater Grail itself.

＠Evil Dragon
Yes. You may be the first to do so since[sr]humanity began using the Gregorian calendar.

Ah, that is a popular misconception. A “dragoon,”[sr]I am afraid, is not one who rides a dragon.

Though I do admit,[sr]it has a very nice ring to it.
