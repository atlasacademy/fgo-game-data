It's Leonidas this time?![sr]But that can't be!
[k]

＠Mash
The Servants we've met so far in this apartment building have all, undoubtedly, had dangerous sides to them.
[k]

＠Mash
But Leonidas shouldn't have any kind of dark side like that! I mean... I mean!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Mash
Leonidas never hated others nor lost sight of himself. He always protected the rear. He is the Guardian of the Thermopylae...
[k]

＠Mash
I respect him! He was ranked as the best shield-holding Heroic Spirit in Chaldea this season!
[k]

＠Mash
There are no bad people among the shield-holding Heroic Spirits!

＠Dr. Roman
Mash, I understand how you feel, but calm down! No matter how you look at him, he's clearly been altered somehow!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's no way that mule-headed, pardon, I mean, that earnest, steady King Leonidas would run around swinging his sword and shouting, “Die!”
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Like the other Servants we've met here, his darkness has been drawn out by this apartment complex!

＠Mash
Doctor! Get out![sr]Leonidas doesn't have a dark side!
[k]

＠Mash
If he did, there's no way he could have inspired 300 soldiers to stand up against an army of over 100,000 enemies!
[k]

＠Mash
He's a very solemn man, and the Guardian of Thermopylae! The valorous and indomitable King Leonidas harbors no evil nor fear in his heart!

＠Leonidas
I've failed. I came here to rescue my comrades and became trapped in this hell! Now I'm so frightened I can't take a single step outside this room!
[k]

＠Leonidas
I can face any physical enemy, be it dragon, or dog-like man! But not ghosts! For some reason, I just can't handle ghosts!
[k]

＠Leonidas
And yet, I slash and slash, but there are ghosts and more ghosts! Are they without number?! What?! New ghosts?!
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Leonidas
They take the forms of my Master and Lady Mash!

Curse you! How dare you strike me where I am weak?! What fearsome wit you have, Ghost!

I apologize, Mash. Just as you said, he hasn't been mutated. He's just bad with ghosts, it seems. Our innocent, little King Leonidas.
