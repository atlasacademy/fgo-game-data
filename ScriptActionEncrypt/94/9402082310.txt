＠A：[servantName 602600:Assassin of Shinjuku:Yan Qing]
By the way, here's a totally random question for ya:[sr]Do you like spicy food, Master?

[charaFace A 6]

[k]

＠A：[servantName 602600:Assassin of Shinjuku:Yan Qing]

Well, the other day I got chocolates from you.[sr]So I'm giving you this.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠A：[servantName 602600:Assassin of Shinjuku:Yan Qing]
I thought a lot about this...but I figured it's best to give you something that would last.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 602600:Assassin of Shinjuku:Yan Qing]
Cuz you know, it's normal for Servants to disappear when they're unneeded.

？1：It's...heavy!?
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠A：[servantName 602600:Assassin of Shinjuku:Yan Qing]
Yeah. It's made out of meteorite iron,[sr]so it might be a bit heavy.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 602600:Assassin of Shinjuku:Yan Qing]
What is it, you ask?[sr]An iron fan, Master. Obviously.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 602600:Assassin of Shinjuku:Yan Qing]
Never heard of it? Sure you have.[sr]It's a type of Chinese concealed weapon.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 602600:Assassin of Shinjuku:Yan Qing]
Didn't they have them in Japan? Oh, right.[sr]You're not used to seeing weapons in the first place...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠A：[servantName 602600:Assassin of Shinjuku:Yan Qing]
