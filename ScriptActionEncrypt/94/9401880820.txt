＠Altera Santa
...You ARE there, right, [%1]?[sr]I can sense you, but I can't see you...
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I can't even see myself, for that matter. So this is the bottom of the abyss, a place devoid of light...
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
...I can't believe it. A human, ignoring my warning, and coming down all this way.
[k]

？1：Ereshkigal!

＠Ereshkigal
That's the fifth time you've spoken my name.[sr]Now you are REALLY dead. That said...
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
... (Sigh)
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Whatever your reasons are, I really must commend you for actually making it here.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
So before I skewer you with my spear,[sr]I can at least ask you this:
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Why did you come this far, human?[sr]Why have you shown yourself before me?
[k]

？1：I came here to see you, of course.
？2：I'm here to help you, whatever the circumstances.

？！

＠Ereshkigal
I see.[sr]In that case...

＠Ereshkigal
I don't know anything about you.[sr]Any memories I had of fighting by your side are gone.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Nergal told me about Chaldea. He also told me that as long as you're around, I'll never be able to disappear.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
...I can't have that. Now that I'm losing my power,[sr]I can't rule the underworld anymore.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
I have nothing against you personally, but I need you to go away if the underworld is to survive.

＠Altera Santa
...Wait. I've been thinking about this a lot, and it doesn't make any sense.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
You say you need Chaldea to go away so that you can disappear yourself.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
But I also heard that you'll disappear even before Chaldea succumbs to the Sumerian Fever.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
So then, why attack Chaldea at all if things are going to turn out the same regardless?

＠Ereshkigal
...It would not be the same. Anyone who could reduce me to this state is far too dangerous to let live.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Whether I exist or not, Chaldea is a threat. In which case, as the ruler of the underworld, it falls to me to do something about it.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
So before I disappear, I'm going to make amends for my sins. When you are facing death, you humans put your affairs in order, right?
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
That's what I'm doing.[sr]I'm using the last of my power to help the underworld.

Now I no longer have the slightest compunction about punishing you.

That's enough, Ereshkigal.[sr]You and your guests have said plenty.
[k]

＠Voice
You have done your job well.[sr]Now, I shall take over for you.
[k]

＠Voice
The underworld is the last bastion for the gods that have declined and vanished. A mystic land of darkness the light of humanity can never reach.
[k]

＠Voice
If you truly wish to protect the underworld, then you will obey me. Do that, and the underworld shall become a land where the dead writhe in pain...
[k]

＠Voice
Do that, and it shall be reborn as a garden of terror, as a world of death, dust, maggots, and plague!

＠Altera Santa
...I see. Now it all makes sense.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
That's Nergal's Authority.[sr]The same one Ereshkigal laid claim to.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
When Nergal lost to Ereshkigal in the underworld, he left behind his hatred. His rage.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Now, with Ereshkigal weakened, that rage has gained new life...and it's using Nergal's remnants[line 2]his Authority[line 2]as an avatar.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
It's basically Nergal's spiritual substitute, representing his essence.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Another ruler of the underworld who would never have shown himself if Ereshkigal hadn't been weakened.
[k]

＠Voice
Correct. Ereshkigal is the good Gallû Spirit, and I am the evil one.
[k]

＠Voice
We are both incarnations of the underworld itself.[sr]We both represent its future.
[k]

＠Voice
Humans cannot hold gods to their standards of good and evil. There are times when so-called good decisions can kill an entire world.
[k]

＠Voice
Now, come, Ereshkigal. The time has come to fulfill your duty. Kill them, and disappear completely.

...I am not the Ereshkigal you know.[sr]I am the Queen of Kur, fallen to disgrace.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
It is only right for one who has lost their power to vacate their position. ...But before I do, I must make amends for the wrongs I have committed.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_24 0.1]

＠Ereshkigal
I have watched your descent through the underworld, mage from a distant land. I will even admit that I enjoyed it.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
But I cannot forget the ruin and disorder that you have brought to the underworld. Now, I will pass judgment on you myself...!
