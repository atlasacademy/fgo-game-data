＠Semiramis
Hmm, actually... Now that I think about it,[sr]it was the same with that very first chocolate.
[k]

＠Semiramis
Why did I want to attempt to make the ultimate chocolate in the first place?

＠Semiramis
Even if it was, say, out of sheer pride as the Queen of Poison, what was I planning to do with the finished product...?

This was but a miraculous coincidence, a bit of fleeting compassion. It goes without saying, but tell no one of it.

Should you dare reveal to another that the great empress personally gifted you chocolate, I will see you torn limb from limb.

I know Chaldea is filled to the brim with tons of chocolate right now, but that cake I just gave you is a bit different.

It was made using the highest-grade chocolate obtained when I worked really hard to help clean up the garden.

Since it was going to be a gift for you,[sr]I wanted it to be especially delicious and unique.
