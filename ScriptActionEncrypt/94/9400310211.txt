Lord Kayneth, we have hastened to join your side and stand in support of you.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
For certain reasons, I cannot divulge my name, so let me give the name of Lady Reines as my guarantor for the time being.
[k]

＠F：???
Reines... My niece?[sr]I demand to know what is going on here!
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Though I would not hesitate to provide an explanation at the present time, I would beg your forbearance until tomorrow.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
However, allow me to say just one thing in advance: I can tell you the current location of Caster.
[k]

＠F：???
Caster? How do you know that?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Tomorrow at noon, I will prove the truth of my words.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
I will show you anew what value lies in listening to our story.
[k]

＠F：???
Humph...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Then, we will pay a visit to your penthouse suite in Fuyuki New Tower at 10 p.m. tomorrow night. So for tonight, will you allow us to go?
[k]

[charaFadeout D 0.1]

＠F：???
Ohh? So you even know my address, do you?[sr]...Very well. I don't dislike a smart man like yourself.
[k]

＠F：???
All the more if you're a mage with a sense of gratitude. But that faint trace of a working-class accent in your English... What a shame.
[k]

＠F：???
But, very well. I shall accept your proposal.
[k]

＠F：???
Having observed how you handled Saber earlier, we will depart here in peace.

Patience, Lancer. Yes, they are clearly a suspicious bunch. But when you know so little about what you face, it's best to wait and observe.

Best to be cautious when starting a fight, got it?

＠El-Melloi
Now then, we can finally take a moment to talk properly. How far did I get in my explanation earlier?
[k]

？1：You said that once this war ends, the world will be destroyed...

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Ah yes, that's right. Defeated Servants are absorbed into the Greater Grail of Fuyuki as sacrifices to bring it to completion.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
But what happens then is not the granting of a wish, but the release of Aŋra Mainiiu... From the start, this war was never meant to have a winner.

What a cruel tale...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
It certainly is. I imagine if I'd been the winner of the Fifth Holy Grail War, I would have turned evil from despair.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Forgive me. And to think I'm the one who's always saying sentimentality is pointless.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
In my experience, the Greater Grail activates in a limited capacity after the defeat of the fifth Servant.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
However, that also means that if we can convince at least three Servants to withdraw from the battlefield intact...

Then the ritual will end up eternally in limbo, the Holy Grail will remain incomplete, and we can simply secure its vessel. Right?

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 1]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Mash
Understood. So this time, we won't be fighting to defeat the other Servants, but to protect them, in a sense.
[k]

＠Mash
Though it'd be best if we could resolve all this amicably.
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
＠El-Melloi
Right. But we can't assume everyone will agree peacefully.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Since we want the War to end in a stalemate, we need to first seek out and defeat the Servants with whom such an agreement is impossible.
[k]

？1：Just when I thought you were a gentleman!
？2：Just when I thought reason would triumph!

？！

＠El-Melloi
I'm aware of my own savagery. [charaFace D 4]Let me say right now that I started off as a cowardly, subservient boy.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
But the war strategist I housed in my body gets so worked up I couldn't help but change.
[k]

？1：He is THE Zhuge Liang.

[charaFace D 1]

＠El-Melloi
Truly. Strategists in Ancient China can get even more violent and ruthless than military generals.
[k]

？2：Sayest thou truly?

[charaFace D 5]

＠El-Melloi
What kind of foolishness is that?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]

＠El-Melloi
It's one thing if theater actors or poets use that language, but why would you talk like that? Are you making fun of them?

＠El-Melloi

＠El-Melloi
Now, back to our conversation.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Of the participants in this Holy Grail War, there are two Servants we couldn't even try to spare... Caster and Archer.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠El-Melloi
Without a shred of doubt, I can say those two would be incapable of reaching an understanding with us.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
So it'd be best to get them out of the way before they start engaging other Servants.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
That brings us to Assassin. Their Master is colluding with the one in possession of Archer.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Since we plan to fight Archer, we'll inevitably have to fight Assassin too. Though they've already marked us as opponents anyway.

＠Mash
Oh, the one we fought right after we Rayshifted here...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Next, we have Berserker... Since his madness prevents us from reasoning with him directly, everything depends on his Master.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
The key will be whether we can convince the Master while he's still able to keep full control over Berserker without having to use Command Spells.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
That said, there's always the possibility Berserker could go on a rampage himself, independent of his Master's will.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
One vital thing I learned after the Fourth War ended is that the one who'd summoned Berserker was in an extremely unstable condition, both physically and mentally.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠El-Melloi
But I never did get to meet him myself...
[k]

＠Mash
Well then, shall we put dealing with Berserker on hold for now?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Though I can't help but feel it is risky, yes.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Therefore, by process of elimination, we can conclude that our best chances for success lie with Saber, Lancer, and Rider.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Ahh, so that's why you prevented that clash on the docks between Saber and Lancer.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Then that only leaves Rider's faction.[sr]Do you think they'd be likely to cooperate?
