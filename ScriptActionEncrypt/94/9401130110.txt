Chacha...I've heard of her. I believe she was the concubine of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the man who unified Japan during the Sengoku* period. (*TL Note: Sengoku=Warring States)
[k]

＠Okita
She was the daughter of Nobunaga's younger sister, Oichi. The eldest of the three Azai Sisters, she led a kinda...ill-fated life.
