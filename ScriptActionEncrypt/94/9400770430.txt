Th-That's strange! There's no way my guardian sphinx is this weak!
[k]

？1：Maybe it's not in its natural habitat?

[charaFace C 8]
＠Nitocris
That's it! How foolish! I should've brought a heater!
[k]

？2：It seemed tired.

[charaFace C 8]
＠Nitocris
(GASP!) It must have been tired from its long journey from Egypt...!
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Nitocris
And it probably couldn't adapt to the environment either! How foolish of me!

I shall praise you for that![sr]But this is the end of the line!

Me too! But this is the underworld right now! If I want to enhance my dark pharaoh power, this is the only place!
[k]

[charaFace C 8]
＠Nitocris
To be honest, the Western underworld is just too damaging.
[k]

＠Nitocris
The Egyptian underworld is vast, comfortable, and dry... Why do you people view death as a negative thing?
[k]

[charaFace C 7]
＠Nitocris
Rather, why do you have to punish souls who have already lost their bodies? Does your god actually hate humans?

＠Elisabeth
So you're a bass player!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Elisabeth
The person that works hard to set the tone of the band from behind the scenes and carve an oppressive sound into the audience!
[k]

[charaFace E 7]
＠Elisabeth
But the sound is usually hidden under the melody of the guitar. The guitar plays the melody, the bass lays down the rhythm...

[charaFace E 4]
＠Elisabeth
Oh, it's so sad! [wt 0.2]The bassist is lonely,[sr]but [charaFace E 1]their job is the most rock n' roll of them all![sr]That's what I think!
