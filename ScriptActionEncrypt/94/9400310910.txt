Well, thanks to us, the Leyline the Tohsakas have kept for generations has been ripped into pieces.

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
It'll take a lot of talent and technique to rebuild it. Hahahah. It'll be a good practice lesson.
[k]

？1：You're a tough teacher, huh?
？2：Isn't that kind of mean?

？！

＠El-Melloi
Not at all. I'm simply offering my students challenges equal to their abilities and tenacity.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
In other words, I hold the daughter of the Tohsakas in extremely high regard... [charaFace D 0]No point in talking about that now, though.

We made it very obvious that we're an enemy.[sr]It's inevitable that they'd retaliate.

＠El-Melloi
For this Holy Grail War, the Einzberns are using their Servant as a decoy, while a hired assassin strikes from the shadows.

I'd like to avoid unnecessary battles... But it would hurt us to leave this circle we just established.

[charaFace D 0]

＠El-Melloi
We have the high ground, [%1].[sr]We'll draw out the battle until they decide to leave.
[k]

？1：Got it!
？2：We'll go with that plan.

？！

＠El-Melloi
And Mash, in this battle keep an eye out for ambushes on your Master.

I'll use my Qi Men Dun Jia to support you.[sr]If you sense anything strange, deal with it immediately.
