＠Passionlip
Sakurament is just SE.RA.PH's version of QP.[sr]It's only called that because BB changed its name.
[k]

＠Passionlip
You can think of it as a kind of excess magical resource floating around SE.RA.PH. Usually, there wouldn't be any need to go out of your way to collect so much of it.
[k]

＠Passionlip
But for BB, it's kind of like storing food for the winter, or a secret nest egg.

You may be a Master, [%1], but you're still young. You lack proper command experience, and you don't know anything about Seraphix.

＠Arnold
You're in the Underarm now, right?[sr]You will proceed to the back area immediately.
[k]

＠Arnold
According to my measurements, you should be able to reach the back from there. Once you do, turn SE.RA.PH back over, and you should find yourself beneath the Command Room.
[k]

＠Arnold
In other words, at the planetarium you mentioned.[sr]I happen to have a map of Seraphix here, you see.

You should be impressed. This map doesn't cover the entire facility, but by correctly measuring each area and combining those measurements...

According to my calculations, Seraphix will reach the bottom of the trench in fifteen real-world minutes, or about twenty-five hours for us.

That will allow you some time to rest. Also, be aware that I will be accompanying you to the planetarium.

＠Meltryllis
We Alter Egos are artificial beings made from an artificial being. There's no substance to us at all.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
The only way we can hold on to our sense of purpose is to cling to the emotions that were used to create us.

We're like dolls that have to chop themselves up for firewood in order to keep warm. We were doomed to disintegrate the moment we were created.

One is the type that never gives up no matter what, but just does whatever they can without being all gung ho about it. Basically, someone who tries to do the best they can all on their own.

The other is the type that scrambles about, trying to turn every hopeless situation around, until everyone in their vicinity is caught up in it.

I prefer the first type, though.[sr]They're much more elegant, after all. That said...
