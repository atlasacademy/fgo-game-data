A lovely pink magical girl and a black magical girl who looks both sturdy and squishy.

If you ask me, the former's more gorgeous than you, and the latter's more endowed.

A crushing loss on your part! For a match to be decided before it's even begun... Jeez! Not even funny!

Yes. I will rephrase my analysis.

The former's not as flowery (read: callous) as you, and the latter's not as sexy (read: crazy).

Now what do you think?

Oh, my... Lord Jason, what embarrassing compliments you brazenly give me.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠A：???
But lying is no good.
[k]

＠A：???
The pink one's not as physically developed as I am, and the black one's clad in colder, more impersonal colors.

Whatever. In any event, I successfully got around your unreasonable demands!

You always make things a deadly venture, even in casual conversation!

[charaFace A 5]
＠A：Medea Lily
Yes. I love peace, but I have no sympathy for intruders.
[k]

＠A：Medea Lily
I shall punish thieves.
[k]

＠A：Medea Lily
Sister Circe said that you can ask them what their circumstances are after their punishment ends.
[k]

[charaShake B 0.07 0 8 1.0]
＠Mini Jason
She's totally right. The Land of Dragons and Sea isn't as sweet and as smart as, well, me.

＠Mini Jason
Everyone here is gentle, the people are happy, they all worship me[line 2]or so it seems.

Lord Jason. Did you say something?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
[charaShake B 0.07 0 8 1.0]
＠Mini Jason
Nothing important.[sr]I was just giving a speech.
[k]

[charaShake B 0.07 0 8 1.0]
＠Mini Jason
Anyway, it's a war. We're fighting a war, Medea.

[charaShake B 0.07 0 8 1.0]
＠Mini Jason
Seems the girls took the wyverns down without a hitch. In my great wisdom I expected as much.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Medea Lily
What? So you weren't actually bringing out the big guns with those wyverns? Lord Jason, what on earth are you planning?
[k]

Humph. What do you think the best weapon to defeat your enemy in battle is?
[k]

[charaShake B 0.07 0 8 1.0]
＠Mini Jason
It's not a powerful Noble Phantasm or natural disaster. It's carelessness. It's being careless, Medea.

A relaxed mentality is the poison that kills humans.[sr]I'll secretly make them realize that later!

Hahaha! They'll be very proud of themselves after defeating those wyverns, and I'll be the one to break that pride!

Of course, I will destroy them, ship and all! Remember, magical girls are as stubborn as they come!

All I managed was five dozen Dragon Tooth Warriors and a ram bearing a curse that decays the enemy's keel.

That's all I have on hand.[sr]My apologies.

...So you always carry all that around? How terrifying. I'm curious as to what your definition of a peace-loving heart is.

Yes! I'm not good in battle, but I'll do my best![sr]All right everyone, charge!
