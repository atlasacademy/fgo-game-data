Oh gosh... Oh my gosh...

？1：So that's our situation.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Mable
Wooow, look at you! You're still in your teens, and yet here you are! You must've been so scared!
[k]

＠Mable
But that aside...waaah![sr]You're trapped here just like I am!
[k]

＠Mable
I haven't been saved at all! Somebody! Anybody![sr][messageShake 0.01 5 5 0.7]Help meee!

I-I've been doing my very best! I even beat my personal lifetime record for fastest sprint!
[k]

＠Mable
Sneaking out once the Alter Ego was asleep and running as fast as I could for that long really took me back to my school days!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Mable
You know how it is. Any group you join eventually makes you run in some sort of marathon, right?
[k]

＠Mable
I tried to tell them I didn't enroll in Rockefella University to join the track team or anything like that!
[k]

＠Mable
But I ended up getting roped into running every year! Thanks to that, though, I'm alive right now!

I see. So that is why you have such shapely legs.

At any rate... Mada[line 2]Lady Mable, can you tell us what you saw in the Central Command Room?

Of course! The Command Room hasn't been digitized![sr][bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]Although, the only survivors besides me...
[k]

＠Mable
are Arnold, Ms. Trapayne, and Holly...
[k]

＠Mable
Ms. Trapayne hasn't been back since she said she was going out to try and contact Chaldea.
[k]

＠Mable
Holly, well... He gave himself too much morphine, and...he hasn't left the locker in a week...
[k]

＠Mable
So the only people left in the Command Room were me and Arnold.
[k]

＠Mable
And we didn't have much food left, so it was just a matter of time until Arnold and I fought, right?
[k]

＠Mable
I didn't want that to happen, so I summoned up my courage and ran away to the outside world.

I see. You've been holed up in the Command Room this whole time.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
So, you can't show us around SE.RA.PH. You can't fight. All you can do is cry and draw enemies to us.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
What are you going to do now, [%1]? I don't see point in keeping this useless human around.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 0.7]
？1：Take her with us, of course.
？2：Let's look for somewhere safe.

Quite right, [%1]. Unfortunately, we shall have to abandon our conquest of Breast Valley for now.

[charaFace C 5]
＠Gawain
Lady Meltryllis, you appear to know where we could find a safe area.
[k]

＠Gawain
Let us hurry there at once, so that [%1] may rest.

Well, these are the Thighs...the area that connects to the dock. There is only one analog building.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
It has magical protection, and contains too many indecipherable elements to digitize...
[k]

＠Meltryllis
It is a Christian chapel built to provide Seraphix's crew a place for spiritual support.

Aha. The cross I was able to see off in the distance must belong to that church.
[k]

＠Tristan
...Unfortunately, there is a Servant here that even I couldn't hope to defeat.
[k]

＠Tristan
The Lancer Count Vlad III, also known as Vlad the Impaler. He still roams this area.
[k]

＠Tristan
We shall have to do battle with him if we are to reach the chapel. Proceed with care.
