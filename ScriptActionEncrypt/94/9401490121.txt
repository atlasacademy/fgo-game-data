Battle has ended. I am not detecting any traces of magical energy around you anymore, either.

Good work, [%1].[sr]The case is closed for now.
[k]

＠Holmes
This shouldn't damage the simulator's operation, and the NPCs should no longer harbor anger.

[charaFace A 5]

＠Holmes
Never forget, Master: those beings battle you endlessly, day and night, so you might train and grow.

Though they will no longer possess anger or feelings of regret...

Even if they are no more than data with neither personality nor life... They are in a sense members of Chaldea who helped in your fight to save humanity.

It may be best to keep that in the back of your mind whenever you go through a Battle Simulation.

Returning to that topic would once more open up a can of worms. If that is all right...

Child of Hydra, dragon's skin and fang, talons of the Tsuchigumo spider of the East, relics and Noble Phantasms left from the Age of Gods...

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Even behind the shadows of society, if we speak of the realm of magecraft, there should be plenty of “proof” you can present.

＠Holmes
I had no choice. If we had dug deeper, we would need to discuss matters such as parallel worlds or the Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon, and I would even need to go into detail about the Age of Gods.
[k]

＠Holmes
We live in a world where the distant past retains no physical trace of us... That is the manner of uncertainty in which we live.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Holmes
It is as it should be, since what we can see and touch and experience as reality are brief, fleeting events.
[k]

＠Holmes
Even secured by the Sacred Lance, such a thing could easily be stripped away if the means were discovered.

There's no need for humans to know.[sr]They shouldn't know.

That is why I was given the Spirit Origin of a Ruler...as a mediator and judge.

I mediate the truth and rule over all creation to maintain the history of humanity.

＠Holmes
As one who shines a light on the truth, I sense that the world is telling me that not all illusions and dreams should be laid bare.

That's utter sophistry. You could very well have avoided any or all of those topics while explaining, great detective that you are.

It's quite vexing to hear you flatter me.[sr]Do stop that at once.

I confess I was interested in the device, from a mathematical standpoint, you see. And I did take a look at the system itself. No more than that, though.

Let's have your story, then. I noticed an inexplicable burst of static lasting only a few seconds during Chaldea's log this past May.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Holmes
Even I could not determine quite what it was.[sr]It must have been a special case indeed.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Holmes
I have at least a notion of what manner of phenomenon it was. You must have used THAT static blocker as a reference.
