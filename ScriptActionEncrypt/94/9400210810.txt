Hmm? Are you outside the apartment right now? Seems like you're in the vicinity.

Senpai, we've lost contact with the Doctor!
[k]

＠Mash
Although I don't think it's mechanical failure, since the spiritrons are unstable around here...

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Speaking of which, what are we doing here, Senpai? The Doctor said our range of investigation should be within the apartment building.

Shiki?

...Someone strange is here. Come out. If you want to hide, you should do something about that murderous aura.

...A-A Servant?[sr]But... I can't see him... I can't see him at all, Master!

＠Mash
He's right in front of me, but all that's there is pure darkness...
[k]

＠Mash
He's a little different than the remnants of Servants - Shadow Servants!
[k]

＠Mash
Also, not Saber... Lancer... Archer... He doesn't belong to any of the seven classes!
[k]

？1：Is he a Ruler then!?

Mediation is the furthest thing from what I do. I'll take that as you picking a fight with me.

＠???
Who are you all, anyway?[sr]Why would you walk around killing ghosts?
[k]

＠???
They were unrewarded in life,[sr]and their regrets keep them away from death.
[k]

＠???
The defeated who were abandoned by life, and left behind by death. They chose emptiness over peacefulness.
[k]

＠???
...Yes, they are nameless, formless monsters. These souls, rejected by even the other side, need peace.
[k]

＠???
If Hell denies them, then I will create a new Hell. That's why this tower must be filled with their grudges.
[k]

＠???
That is my faith, and why I exist.[sr]Oh light, do not stand in my way.

Oh, this is not good.[sr]This is not good, Master [%1].

＠Mephisto
That's an Innocent Monster with super-recovery, super-stamina, and super-skills. The ultimate form of someone who absolutely hates humans.
[k]

＠Mephisto
In the world of Magecraft, there's this thing called something-Murder that can reliably kill any primate species.
[k]

＠Mephisto
And what we have here is a nameless weakling who seems to be reaching that state.
[k]

＠Mephisto
A shame. My dream of seeing Master's destruction is going to end here. You know why, yes?
[k]

＠Mephisto
Because we are all going to die here.

You're giving up awfully early, clown.

＠Ryougi Shiki
True, we'll be done here if that's a real Monster of Gaia, but... he's just a defective Monster of Alaya.

＠Ryougi Shiki
If our opponent is a ghost who's fallen into madness after death, we'll just have to fight with the same amount of madness.

＠Mash
Senpai, Shiki's acting weird! The fact that she all of a sudden changed clothes is not the problem...
[k]

＠Mash
...It's that she's so graceful, flowers themselves bloom in shame. She is the embodiment of pure beauty.

Oh my. That's what surprises you?[sr]It's refreshing seeing you acting like a girl.

It's the fault of the land here that a ghost like this grew so strong.

I just remembered.[sr]Is this where that mage died?

Yes. I don't remember it,[sr]but if you do...

[line 3]Hehe. Then it must be fate.[sr]It's strange, but it makes me very happy.

You said you wanted to create a Hell here. But that's Lord Enma's jurisdiction.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Even Hell doesn't welcome an amplifier for hateful screams... Your possible dream... Let it disappear into the rift of this world.
