By merely hardening the ground and setting up wooden handrails, I think it is a lot easier to walk along now.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
But this path still has one problem.[sr]Or at least that's what I think.
[k]


？1：And what would that be?
？2：I'll work to fix it.
？！

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Oh, no, it's not your fault at all. Rather, it's mine.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
This path is so rustic that I can't shake the feeling that there's a farm up ahead.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
If I'm not careful, I'll get so excited that I might just start running.
[k]


？1：Like...you're full of youthful energy?
？2：Like...you're sexually frustrated?
？！

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Hmm, how do I put it? My feral nature, I guess.

I'm Tamamo Summer, a monster of summer, so I feel like I can't hold back...

...Does that mean you might run around cheerfully like Tamamo Cat? I would like to see that, actually.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Yeah! Exactly![sr]But that's embarrassing, so I'm holding it in!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Listen, I am different from that thing! My swimsuit version is entirely different to begin with!

R-Right, umm...I am sorry...

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Humph...but, anyway.[sr]The scent of this new path is quite nice.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I get this feeling like there are defenseless livestock waiting up ahead...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Gah, I can't hold back! I know it's silly, but I'm going to run up this path a bit to vent my wild side!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
If I come across a wild rabbit or something I'll bring it back for you, so look forward to my return!

Ever since we've come to this island...
[k]

＠Mash
Tamamo-no-Mae seems to be exhibiting an eccentricity similar to that of Tamamo Cat...
[k]

？1：Shhh!
？2：Let's pretend we haven't noticed...
