What is this raining down upon my garden...and without even any notification...

What gall! Normally, I would have shot whatever it is down without question, so you should thank your lucky stars that it was me who you're dealing with.

＠X Alter
Yes. I went back to the Servant Universe, but when I heard that Chaldea had a cacao shortage...
[k]

＠X Alter
...I headed over to the Spacebucks on[sr]the planet Totooine to stock up on some.
[k]

＠X Alter
And when I got to the shop...I received quite the surprise. I won a special prize for being a repdigit customer.
[k]

＠X Alter
And my prize was a chocolate starship. But since it's not a Japanese sweet, I wasn't too thrilled...

Hm...I do not quite understand, but are you saying that this is chocolate from the Servant Universe?
[k]

＠Semiramis
There's plenty of it, and it's good quality. I see no reason not to blend it in with the chocolates we are making in the Hanging Gardens...
[k]

＠X Alter
The vessel was only good for a one-way trip anyway.[sr]I'd be happy to trade it for some Japanese sweets.
[k]

＠X Alter
...And all for the low, low rate of one Japanese confection per chocolate ton. Preferably kintsuba.

＠Semiramis
Negotiating with me? How careless with your life, even for a hero. Very well. I suppose I will let your recklessness go unpunished.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Semiramis
But I shall warn you: I do not want to hear you complain if your reward is poisoned.
[k]

＠X Alter
I'm not a hero; I'm a villain. And my training has afforded me some resistance to poison, so bring it on.
[k]

＠X Alter
One day I'd even like to eat enough red bean[sr]paste to paralyze myself. One can dream...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Semiramis
I-I see.[sr]And [charaFace A 0]is this all the space chocolate you have?
[k]

＠X Alter
You can have seconds. I could even go[sr]back to Totooine's Spacebucks for more, if necessary.
[k]

＠X Alter
I got that ship by being the eleventh customer.
[k]

＠X Alter
If I head back and just keep going in and out of the store, it shouldn't be hard to be the twenty-second or even the thirty-third customer.
[k]

？1：They don't do much business, do they?
？！

＠X Alter
That's because Totooine is in the Outer Rim.[sr]Nice place to visit, though, even if it's all just...sand...

＠Da Vinci
Honestly, no. The supply of chocolate has now clearly eclipsed the demand.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The commissary's having a fire sale, and the cafeteria has started to make various chocolate dishes just to try to get rid of the stock.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The smell of chocolate is wafting all around Chaldea...and it's giving people heartburn.
[k]

？1：How's your investigation going?
？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
I might need a bit more time. And I'm aware that I need to come up with a solution before Chaldea is crushed under a tide of chocolate.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Sorry, but just a big longer, [%1]!
