I never thought you and I would team up.[sr][charaFace F 1]Highly unlikely, even for our originals!

...It's for her sake. We have no choice.[sr]Also, [charaFace E 5]I would never want to pair up with “that.”

[charaFace F 4]
＠Arash
Hmm... I agree.[sr]Quite vexing.
[k]

＠Arash
First of all, the fact that it is impossible to communicate is quite a problem.

[charaFace E 4]
＠Arjuna
It's not that she can't perceive data from the five senses, it's that she doesn't.

It's not that she's blind or deaf, it's that she doesn't try to see or listen.

The trouble is that she possesses top-class abilities.

Siegfried's loss is unfortunate.[sr]...I am sorry we dragged him into this.

[charaFace F 4]

No. Precisely because he was defenseless, we were able to lure them into this trap. He would've wanted this.
