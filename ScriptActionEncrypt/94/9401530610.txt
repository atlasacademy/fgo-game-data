Oh, please do tell me. I'm just a monster locked in her tiny cell, so I would love to know how it feels, even after you begged for my help.

However, it is precisely those sorts of heroes who tend to die young.

In that sense, it is entirely plausible that she is the eldest among us, at least in terms of mental age.

...MY mental age? Hahaha, don't be silly! My body may be fifty-something, but my heart is still in its teens!

If anything, I would like nothing better than to continue singing the praises of youth now and forever! Feel free to encourage me in this pursuit!
