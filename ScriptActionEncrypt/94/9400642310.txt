Dr. Romani looked disappointed.
[k]

＠Illya
This is all our fault. I'm sorry.

＠Mash
No, there's no need for you to be sorry. Romani Archaman is Chaldea's current commander in charge.
[k]

＠Mash
If he felt there was real danger, he would have forced us to transport back.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
He didn't do that, which means the doctor understands how important this matter is as well.
[k]

？1：Yep.
？2：If anything, he was just sulking.

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes. He's been left out in the cold more than ever this time, so let's thank him again when we get back.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Illya
(That's what she says, but Mash looks like she's sulking a little too.)

＠Mash
Anyway, until the next planned contact, we will have no method of communicating with Chaldea.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Since we've chosen to accompany Illya, we must now be even more on our guard.

[%1], the same goes for you.[sr]If you're a Master, then get a grip.

Even if you guys are acting out a magical girl fantasy, that doesn't mean your heart has turned into a familiar.

Then there's no need to steal the powers of the First Lady. Medb will do as much as she can in her own way.
