＠
Valentine's Day...[sr]A day of battle that happens once a year.
[k]

＠
But...this time the battle began[sr]well in advance of the day itself.
[k]

＠
It began the moment they decided to communicate their feelings with chocolate, the moment they made chocolate the vessel of their wishes.
[k]

＠
For some, it began a year ago, when they shed tears over chocolates they could not muster the courage to give.
[k]

＠
And now, one girl prepares[sr]to step onto the battlefield...
[k]

＠
...Really, if we get right down to it,[sr]that's where all this started...
[k]

＠
Don't get the wrong idea though. The girl shouldn't be criticized. She did nothing wrong.
[k]

＠
She only did what any girl in love would do.
[k]

＠
That's right. Things just happened to unfold that way, as naturally as the numbers two and three follow one.
[k]

＠
Of course, for the moment,[sr]no one knows that this is the beginning.
[k]

＠
None could have anticipated that this girl's ordinary actions would lead Chaldea into a great crisis!

I see now that wrapping myself in a ribbon and nothing else and presenting myself as 100% Kiyohime chocolate was taking things a bit far.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Though there could be no more fitting chocolate to demonstrate my love for Master, it was pointed out to me that my gift was difficult to...“eat”...

And I knew they weren't lying, so that was acceptable.[sr]I suppose I should be more mindful of the recipient...

Notice regarding[sr]“Servant Specialty Plain Chocolate.”
[k]

＠
The Chaldea Commissary has always offered chocolate made from divine cacao and capable of enduring the magical energy inherent in the cooking processes of most Servants.
[k]

＠
Jaguar Warrior normally provides us with the cacao in exchange for collected Jaguar Stamps.
[k]

＠
However, we received the following notice from Madame Jaguar yesterday: “Nope. Furrget it. Can't do it. I can't get cacao anymore... Oopsie.”
[k]


＠
We are thus regrettably unable to procure a shipment of this product at this time.
[k]

＠
We apologize for the inconvenience.
[k]

＠
Madame Jaguar's response can be found below: “It's not my fault. Sure, purrhaps they found out that I kept going into Tezca's territory to smuggle the stuff back here...
[k]

＠
...but even then, it's still not MY fault!”[sr]This is repeated several times.

As I said, we know all about you.[sr]Especially about your wickedness.

Armed with that knowledge, if we weren't cautious, wouldn't we be precisely the fools that you most despise?

But you have a point. Had you approached me blindly and without any knowledge of me, I would have torn you apart limb from limb.
[k]

＠Semiramis
But if your caution arises from your awareness of how terrifying I am, I will permit it.
[k]

[charaFace H 12]

＠Semiramis
Nonetheless, you have no reason to be concerned this time. Had I intended to kill you, I would have done so the moment you arrived.
[k]

＠Semiramis
After all, I had plenty of time to activate my Tiamtum Ūmu, even before you set foot here.
[k]

＠Semiramis
My purpose here is simple:[sr]I merely want to make chocolate.
[k]

＠Semiramis
To make as much as I can, and of the very highest quality. That is the earnest wish of this floating garden.

Do mere subjects need to understand the workings of their empress's mind? I think not.

Even inquiring into such a thing should be criminal. Neither ask nor concern yourself with that. As my subjects, you need only obey.

If you assist me, I will sell you some of the final product. I guarantee the chocolate will be of the very highest quality.
[k]

＠Semiramis
Cool, sweet, bitter, and rich...a most delicious treat to be sure.
[k]

＠Semiramis
Chocolate seeps into the very depths of the human body,[sr]and at times can become something quite lethal...
[k]

[charaFace H 12]

＠Semiramis
All of this is to say that[sr]chocolate is a form of poison.
[k]

＠Semiramis
And so, as the original poisoner, I could never make chocolate of anything but the highest quality.

Chocolates are a luxury item, so it wouldn't be the end of the world if we didn't get any...

I personally resolved to give cookies as a gift this year, but I'm sure there will be others who are not so understanding and adaptable.

This entire garden is my territory. I can change it however I wish, but to do or make anything I will require materials with which to work.
