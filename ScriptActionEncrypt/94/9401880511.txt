Now I see. So you're wearing that bizarre costume because you are Santa Claus.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Ushiwakamaru
To think you are bringing a present to that cold, obstinate, stingy, isolated Ereshkigal...
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
It is no easy feat to traverse this frigid wasteland, yet you do it to bring cheer to others... Impressive.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Although...I am a little disappointed you did not come here out of concern for me. Tch.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Well, no matter. It is not as though I would do anything differently anyway.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I would much rather celebrate Christmas with close female friends than this dim-witted stick-in-the-mud.
