Obviously I didn't make any of them. It was all Shuten. Crafts, souvenirs, you name it...

She only made one at first, but when I asked her for more, she was kind enough to oblige!

Of course, as everyone knows, my greatest joy[sr]is simply being together with Shuten.

But since she has to stay on the tippy-top floor,[sr]I had her make all these to keep me company.

I now have enough Shuten-Douji, terror of Kyoto,[sr]to make my own baseball team!

Truly there can be no sight more hellish than this...[sr]I daresay I may even have gone a bit overboard.

[charaFace C 2]

But that is not all. I also have this candy![sr]See how it is red as blood, and soft as a fresh liver!

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Heh, no doubt the mere sight of it fills you with dread... That is because it is Shuten candy made by Shuten herself.

Even I shudder to think what went into it![sr]Now...I shall do this!
