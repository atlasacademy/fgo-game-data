Instead of having a split personality, you were acting like someone with dual personalities.

As a fan, you can't blame me for being disappointed, can you?

I'd bury my head in the sand if I could. But looks like I don't need to do that, right?

Considering there's a dangerous fan here, I guess I shall take my leave.

See ya, mass murderer of the present. Just be careful and make sure you don't become a knock-off.

Ah, I forgot to mention it.[sr]It is what makes this apartment special.
[k]

＠Mephisto
Certain characteristics? Past history? Criminal record? Hmmmmm, well, let's just keep that vague.
[k]

＠Mephisto
Anyway, if certain Servants stay here, their alignment will change, and become more resentful.
[k]

＠Mephisto
I myself was changed that way! Even if I want to fight, I took an arrow to the shin! Ow!

Yes. Well, they get angry easily so it's more like stress level? Like lowering the boiling point?
[k]

＠Mephisto
So it's not really that harmful.[sr]However[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Mephisto
For the people that ended their life full of resentment and sadness, this place will work wonders!
[k]

＠Mephisto
Heroic Spirits ending up as evil ghosts due to their own resentment for humans... Isn't that ironic?
[k]

＠Mephisto
Yes, even the evil me used that and asked those kinds of Servants to come here.
[k]

＠Mephisto
As you can see, all the Servants that moved here went crazy, right?

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mephisto
I can't believe it... You have a contract with a Servant who was a judge?
[k]

＠Mephisto
Will the jury be full of homunculi? I mean, human trials can be tough, you know?
[k]

？2：Mastermind?

[charaFace E 3]

Oops, I was caught by Mash's beauty and said too much. Zipping my mouth now.
