＠Mash
You look troubled, Ushiwakamaru.[sr]Is there something bothering you?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Of course. It's Benkei.[sr]Also what happened at the gate back there.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
My lord, was he that strong before?[sr]He certainly looks like he's larger...
[k]

？1：It's better than becoming weaker.

[charaFace D 3]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Well, yes, that's true.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
But it seems awfully unnatural.[sr]I wonder if he ate some strange herbs...
[k]

？2：Do you suspect him of using drugs!?
？！

Hahaha! Nice joke! I do nothing that would shame me before the Buddha.

I had some delicious tea at the teahouse, though.
[k]

[charaTalk A]

＠Mash
Tea...you say? On this island?
[k]

[charaTalk F]
[charaFace F 0]

＠Benkei
Yes. I think it's just before the next gate. There is a teahouse at the first settlement that I went to.
[k]

＠Benkei
It was bright inside, and the customers weren't gloomy like the people in that settlement, but very lively.
[k]

＠Benkei
How about we go there to gather information?[sr]We might be able to hear some interesting news.
[k]

？1：I like that. Let's go!
？2：Come to think of it, Kojirou said something about that too...

Ooh! Taking a break at a rest stop during a trip is a real pleasure. I have no complaints about heading there first.

Come to think of it, the tea was so good that I had the teahouse fill my flask with it. Go ahead, have some.

[charaFace D 1]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Oh, you're very kind. Thank you for this.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
(Glug glug) Hmm... This tea has a strange flavor...[sr]It is definitely delicious, but...

What are you talking about, Mash.[sr]There's nothing wrong with me at all.
[k]


＠Ushiwakamaru
Okay, now that we know where we're going, let's get moving. Ooh! Have a look at that, my lord.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
There is a jizo statue at the side of the road here.[sr]It appears that some humans here still have faith.
[k]

I don't think so... She's been standing there and staring at that jizo statue for a while now. What's going on...?

＠Ushiwakamaru
Ah... My older brother!

This...this statue's face![sr]It looks just like my brother!

A-Are you serious?[sr]It just looks like an ordinary jizo to me...

That's because none of you know my brother! This smooth skin, this stone-like appearance, this special presence...and this expression!
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
This is exactly what my brother's face looks like when he peers at me with those cold, dead eyes!
[k]

[charaTalk F]

＠Benkei
I guess if you say so, Lord Yoshitsune, then it must be true.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Well, who'd have thought I'd find such a fine gem in a place like this? ...It must be the work of a renowned stonemason or a monk.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
But this is Onigashima. Who knows when some oni with no sense of worth might come along and crush it?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Then I must protect my dear brother.[sr]You're coming with me. Up you go!
[k]

[charaTalk A]

＠Mash
Ushiwakamaru has tucked the jizo under her arm... She's picked it up and is walking off with it. I-Is that all right?

Well, no, I don't think so, but there doesn't seem to be anyone around who might claim ownership of it...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But, you know, Ushiwakamaru seems to have suddenly started saying and doing odd things, and her attitude has changed a little[line 2]
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]

＠Dr. Roman
Hm? She appears normal, but something is odd about her... Didn't something like this happen before?

Isn't it obvious[line 2]?[sr]So I can offer the heads of our enemies to him!
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
With enemies appearing so soon after finding my brother, it means only one thing! My brother wants the enemy leader's head[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace D 7]

＠Ushiwakamaru
1, 2, 3[line 2] Look at them all![sr]Yes! The more, the merrier!
[k]



＠Ushiwakamaru
I will offer a mountain of freshly taken oni heads dripping with blood to my brother, and he will praise me!
[k]

[charaFace D 8]

＠Ushiwakamaru
He'll say, “Again, Yoshitsune? Well done. Now get back to the battlefield before Masako comes in here shouting!”
