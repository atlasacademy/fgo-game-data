Ring a ding ding![wt 2.0][sr]Ahem. Attention, please. Attention, please!

This is a message from your talented and beautiful kouhai, to the terribly pathetic Senpai who's spending Valentine's Day all by [&his:her] lonesome♡
[k]

＠???
Reflecting on [&his:her] sad existence[sr]in a dark corner of My Room...
[k]

＠???
...melancholily counting all the spots on the ceiling...
[k]

＠???
...Such inactivity and wasting of time is probably how you usually spend your days, but today is different!
[k]

＠???
No one could have imagined, but there was a (totally) random lottery, and your name was selected to be the representative for all of humanity!

Yes, so please hurry up and get dressed. Being in your pajamas or just in your underwear would be a no-no for the FCC!
[k]

＠???
Eh? What are we doing, you ask?[sr]Well, if I were to explain...
[k]

？1：...I have a BAD feeling about this!
？2：...I shouldn't listen till the end...

Even my magical stick of discipline becomes supercute if it's waved...and Senpai's dismal room also turns into a fabulous studio in a heartbeat!

Before [%1] knew it, [&he:she] was standing in a specially made room on SE.RA.PH...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠BB
Just kidding. I've gotten tired of that schtick, so none of that! Good work on the spontaneous transfer☆
[k]

＠BB
After all, the moment you triggered the BB flag in-game, you were destined for a bad end. Welcome, and just give up, S-E-N-P-A-I♡
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠BB
That said...why did you want to get away in the first place? It actually kind of hurts that you tried to get away so fast!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠BB
While it's true that I've done some terrible things, I still plan on being a nice, hedonistic AI...
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠BB
...and I was even all pumped up about making Master happy, at least during Valentine's Day...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠BB
Sad...so sad...it makes my heart break into pieces... My chest, too! Oh by the way, my bust size is DANGER cup, as you can see.
[k]


＠BB
And as for you, Senpai, I want you to continue wallowing in the sadness of your [&overflowing desires:harsh reality]...
[k]

？1：So, it's crocodile tears today, BB?

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠BB
Yes, of course![sr]I'm well aware of your behavior patterns♡
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠BB
Also, I'm very aware of how many chocolates[sr]you will likely get from the other Servants.
[k]

＠BB
Unbelievably...
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠BB
...it's quite a high number... I underestimated how hard you tried throughout the year, Senpai.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠BB
Anyway! Instead of acting all big,[sr]BB has decided to just straight-up take action!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠BB
Those who act swiftly and make the biggest impact are the winners here. Well then, here you go, Senpai☆

BB's specialty, spinning Fate Drum! Oh, the word “fate” in this case means a tragic destiny, of course!
[k]

？1：This is the infamous...!

[charaFace A 10]

＠BB
Yes. It's the slot machine that I set up with only the purest of intentions, but which somehow drew the ire of all the other Servants...
[k]

＠BB
Humans are professionals when it comes to inconvenience, so I thought they would appreciate it...
[k]

＠BB
...but now BB knows she has done something bad...
[k]

？2：I've never seen a slot machine like this before...

[charaFace A 0]

＠BB
That's right. I've prepared four categories:[sr]dog, bug, cow, and bust...!
[k]

＠BB
If the little pictures line up, then you'll get to[sr]go to a special stage. So I hope you're excited♡
[k]

？！

？1：Okay. I'll eat it if it's chocolate.

[charaFace A 3]

＠BB
Aw...but I worked really hard to make it actually work like a slot machine. You're not even going to give it a little spin?
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠BB
Unfortunate, but that's a smart decision,[sr][%1].
[k]

＠BB
After all, you wouldn't be able to enjoy the rest of your Valentine's Day if you played with it... Tch...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠BB
But for my Senpai who takes good care of me, BB is going to take a break from putting her own desires first☆
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠BB
Anyway, Senpai, please take this doohickey back home.
[k]

＠BB
Out of consideration for Lip, I shouldn't monopolize you the entire time. So I'm signing off for today!

[branch select01_end]

？2：Is that...real?

[charaFace A 11]

＠BB
Of course it's real! (Grin)
[k]

＠BB
And since you chose this, Senpai,[sr]you have no right to refuse.
[k]

＠BB
After all, you won't be able to leave[sr]this studio until you try your luck.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠BB
Go ahead. Test your destiny.[sr]Your chance of survival is four to one.
[k]

＠BB
Pretty good odds for the Master[sr]who conquered SE.RA.PH, right?
[k]

？1：I guess I have no choice...

[charaFace A 1]

＠BB
Kya☆ What an unnecessary act of bravery!
[k]

＠BB
So gung ho! Ready to try every single quest...maybe by throwing in a Berserker...
[k]

＠BB
I like that unwavering mentality of yours!
[k]

＠BB
How interes[line 2]I mean, that's my [%1]!
[k]

[charaFace A 11]

＠BB
But please be careful. I'm one of those people[sr]who gets more excited over mundane games.
[k]

＠BB
Even if you fail midway, I won't let you give up.[sr]You'll have to keep on going until you reach the end!
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_51 2.0]

[charaFace A 12]

＠BB
That's right! On and on![sr]I won't let you go even if the world ends!
[k]

＠BB
So there you have it, Master of Chaldea. I hope[sr]you can get back before Valentine's Day is over.
