Hm? What's that...?

＠Rama
Well if that's the case, I need something to give you in return...
[k]

＠Rama
I may not seem it, but I am the king of Kosala.[sr]As such, I would like to give you a lavish, exquisite gift.
[k]

？1：You don't have to worry about it!

[charaFace A 4]
＠Rama
H-hmm... Then I will take back the exquisite and lavish part.
[k]

＠Rama
But even so...what should I give...?
[k]

＠Rama
What would Sita enjoy?
[k]

＠Rama
Sita...would be happy no matter what I gave her.
[k]

？2：It's just a token of my gratitude.

＠Rama
I-I see.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Rama
I suppose a lavish return gift would be a bit much for a simple gift of gratitude.
[k]

？！

＠Rama
Well then, how about my favorite food?[wt 0.3][charaFace A 1][sr]Ah, that would please you?
[k]

＠Rama
Then wait a moment!

Yes, they're Hanuman-approved bananas.

They are Hanuman's favorite after all, so I can guarantee they're delicious!

You can even freeze them and make them into sherbert later!
