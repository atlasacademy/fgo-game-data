And because you were doing nothing as leader, the townspeople didn't know if it was okay to get ready for the festival or not!

＠Robin Hood
Neither did your soldiers! They couldn't decide whether to go forward with the preparations or whether to stop them!

You were the only one who was getting excited for Halloween, basically!

I'm in shock. How can you be a ruler if you don't care for your people?
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
A ruler must first ensure that their subordinates' bellies are full. Only then can the ruler eat.[charaChange D 98105300 0 normal 0][wait charaMove D][charaFace D 0][se ad182][seVolume ad182 0 0.4] (Chomp chomp)[wt 0.2][se ad182]
