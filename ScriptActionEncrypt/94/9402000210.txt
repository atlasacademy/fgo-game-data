As the general leading this operation, I must take care of the exhausted Servants under my command.

＠General Setsubun
I have thought a great deal about[sr]what I might do to assist them...
[k]

＠General Setsubun
At length, I arrived at a decision.[sr]Part of that decision was to come here.

Yes, this place seems perfect.[sr]Now then, this is still a work in progress, but...

I merely gave the spring water lying dormant here a little encouragement. Hot springs and R & R go hand in hand, after all.

＠General Setsubun
And since this is a spirit spring,[sr]it should even work on Servants to a degree.

...can speed up their recovery by soaking in the springs, huh. Sounds great!

It looks so good I wish I could dump my work on Holmes and go for a soak there myself!

Indeed. It is my job to ensure that everyone can regain their lost spirits as soon as possible.

＠General Setsubun
As such, I will change my clothes to help me better handle a variety of problems, such as the water being too hot or not hot enough.

＠Madam Setsubun
Here, I am Madam Setsubun, the caretaker of these spirit springs. I can even make hot spring eggs if one so pleases.
[k]

＠Madam Setsubun
Please, come and soak in these waters yourself,[sr]Master. I would be glad to wash your back for you.
[k]

＠Madam Setsubun
...Not to worry, I am fully aware of modern[sr]conceptions of chastity and similar values.
[k]

＠Madam Setsubun
As such, I will be sure to split the[sr]baths into men's and women's sections.

[charaFace D 0]

＠Madam Setsubun
For those who fall under neither gender or wish for[sr]their gender to remain a mystery, and particularly for Lord Astolfo...
[k]

＠Madam Setsubun
...I will prepare a steel drum bath[sr]in a separate, private tent.
[k]

＠Madam Setsubun
Of course, no one is obligated to make use of these facilities. I only offer them as a way to help.
[k]

＠Madam Setsubun
Oh, now that I think of it, some of the Servants will need baths for their steeds as well... There is still much I need to prepare.

[k]

＠Da Vinci
I just whipped up a visual filter. This way, even if footage of these baths ends up on Chaldea monitors for some inexplicable reason...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...the filter will automatically process the image to make it seem as though everyone is still wearing clothes.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Not, I confess, my most elegant solution,[sr]but it is at least an ethical one.

Now now, wipe those tears off the console,[sr]Mr. Meunière. We can't have them causing a short.

＠Mash
...having a place like this where you can all rest and recuperate should be a great help going forward.
[k]

＠Mash
Let's be sure to take everyone's exhaustion into account and make use of these springs as we make our way up the tower, Master!
