...Are not the words I will be using today.[charaFace A 6] Obviously,[sr]if there is anyone in a brazen outfit, that would be a different story...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Now then. I have heard about how special today is.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
A day, I am told, to offer gifts.[sr]It is a Western custom, correct?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Yes...yes...[sr]That is a wonderful custom, truly...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...and so, I have prepared a little something myself.

Yes. All my skill went into making this!

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I am in Western attire, after all. So I believe it would be most appropriate to offer you Western style sweets...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I made this with the guidance of Lord Emiya,[sr]Lady Boudica, and even Lady Cat.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I hope it is to your liking...

...Tee hee.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I hope you enjoy and savor the sweets that encapsulate my feelings towards you, as the shadow prefect.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Now then. Shall we head out?
[k]

？1：Come again?
？2：Head out? To where? To do what?

？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
May I remind you that today is a day to offer gifts to those you have feelings for.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
But these gifts absolutely may not be heart-shaped![sr]That is forbidden!
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Such a shape would lead to thoughts and possibly even acts of indecency! No, no, I mustn't let that happen!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
That's why we, as shadow prefects,[sr]must be diligent in our cause!
[k]

？1：Wait a minute...
？2：Didn't you say you weren't going to say “forbidden” today?

？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
There must always be exceptions to any rule! Now then, let's go, Kyogoku! It is time to make our rounds!
