＠Ishtar Commentary
Once our racers get through here, all that remains is the final area: a short straightaway to the finish line!
[k]

＠Ishtar Commentary
In the final area, each team's total times for the previous areas will be added up, and their starting times will be adjusted accordingly.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Ishtar Commentary
Which means the fourth area is their last chance to put themselves at an advantage for the home stretch!

[charaFace B 6]

Teams who have been falling behind will want to focus on closing the gap.

And those who are doing well will want to try and extend their lead. Best of luck to all of you!

So, uh, that's why I'll only let you all pass through my valley if you find my real darling and return him to me!

Well, I suppose that while I was lovingly squeezing darling...
[k]

＠C：Artemis B
...I might have ended up squeezing too hard because the thing under our feet was the same.

＠C：Artemis B
So he might have got caught in that before one thing led to another, I guess.
