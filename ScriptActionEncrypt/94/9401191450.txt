Lip and I are no exception.[sr]BB placed a number of restrictions on us.

We were specifically prohibited from telling anyone about SE.RA.PH's true origin and purpose.

So he thought he would start by creating a new playing field that's arranged so he can't lose.

＠Emiya Alter
He took over Seraphix, somehow learned about the Moon Holy Grail from a different time line, and summoned BB.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Then he appointed BB as his navigator and had her turn Seraphix into SE.RA.PH, all so that he could be reborn without anyone realizing.
