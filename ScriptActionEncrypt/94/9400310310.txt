Well, Mash? How's the summoning circle coming along?

Not so well...

？！

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
The Leyline is here, but it's being guarded by another spell so I can't access it.

Hmm, I guess it's difficult to set up on a land controlled by a proper mage...
[k]

？1：What do you mean?

？！

＠El-Melloi
All the Leylines in this area are under the control of a certain mage clan.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
I thought there would be a weakness I could exploit, but I was too naive.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠El-Melloi
...Her father truly is a skilled mage. With how I am now, I can tell the structure of this spell is very solid.

What should we do? At this rate we won't be able to get supplies from Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠El-Melloi
We've got no choice but to destroy the keystones the mage placed, and take the Leyline for ourselves.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
They should be fairly well-defended,[sr]but we'll have to break through.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠El-Melloi
I'd like to avoid unnecessary combat, because we can't fight on an empty stomach. Nothing for it.

You mean destroy the barrier keystones!? If you do that, won't the mage, the Second Owner, get mad?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Of course. But the family that owns this land, the Tohsakas, are also the mages that summoned Archer.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
In other words, they're our enemies to begin with.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 4]

＠Dr. Roman
...I see. But the keystone to the Leylines should be carefully hidden, right?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Don't worry. I know where they are already.

What? How did you find out?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠El-Melloi
The next heir to the Tohsaka clan is a student of mine. [charaFace D 0]In the end, I dismantle the Greater Grail here with her help.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
When that happens, I learn the structure of the Leylines in this area.

＠Dr. Roman
Wait a second. You're going to wreck your future student's estate?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
This future happens in a different timeline. I have no duty or responsibility to the Tohsakas in this era.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
And the Tohsaka family was one of the clans responsible for the Fuyuki Holy Grail War.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠El-Melloi
If they lose their Leyline and become impoverished, it's their own fault. I'm sure the future Tohsaka will understand.

＠El-Melloi
Let's start with the nearest point.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
After we destroy several of the keystones, we can try setting up the circle again.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Is this okay?[sr]Stuff like this always comes back to haunt you...
