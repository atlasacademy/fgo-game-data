Good morning, X.[sr]Senpai, X is awake.
[k]

？1：Good Morning, X.

[charaFace D 3]
＠X
G-Good morning.[sr]So you fought as well, [%1].
[k]

？2：That was one rough battle!

[charaFace D 4]
＠X
I can tell by the wretched spectacle upon this plain.[sr]Just how many times did Excalibur fire recklessly?
[k]

＠X
This is exactly what's so bad about the wielders of Holy Swords... Wait, I'm one of those too.
[k]

＠X
Actually, it's believed that the random firing of Holy Swords gave birth to Altrium particles.
[k]

＠X
People often joke, “Ha-ha-ha! After blasting these clean energy beams, we've actually polluted the atmosphere! Isn't that nuts?”
[k]

But that may not be a lie after all...

Nero and the others have already left.[sr]“If I am around, it will only ruin X's awakening!” she said.

[charaFace D 4]
＠X
...
[k]

[charaFace C 13]
＠Mash
She also left this message. “There is something you must say upon your awakening!” she said.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠X
...That's none of her business.[sr]I really do not get along with her at all.

Y-Yes?[sr]What is it, Ms. X?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠X
I must apologize to you![sr]I'm sorry!
[k]

＠X
Just like Z said, I was belittling you!
[k]

＠X
I thought that even if I trained you, I could still handle you... So I was going to leave only you alive in this era.
[k]

＠X
Then after I returned to the future,[sr]I was going to cut you down!
[k]

？1：That's very brave of you to say, but you're merciless, X!
？2：You call yourself...a Holy Sword Warrior...

？！

[charaFace D 5]
＠X
Don't interrupt me![sr]I seriously regret this!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠X
...Well, I mean, I'm entirely at fault.[sr]From beginning to end, I was merely using you.
[k]

＠X
...Therefore, your training end[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Lily
Yes, of course![sr]We're going to continue my training, right, Ms. X!?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠X
[line 3]Why?[sr]I told you I deceived you. Didn't you hear me?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Lily
No, you didn't. From the very start, you have believed in me.
[k]

＠Lily
You said, “This Saber, I can train.”[sr]That's why I was able to fight with all my might.
[k]

＠Lily
I mean[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Lily
Since you trusted and praised me so much,[sr]I must do my best to repay that kindness.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠X
Oh, well... I guess you could take it that way too.[sr]...I'm at a loss.
[k]

＠X
[%1].[sr]What should I do about this?
[k]

？1：You may as well just resign yourself to training her.

＠X
...Well, I guess.[sr]But I'm not really sure how to do that...
[k]

？2：Just be honest with her, and accept it.

[charaFace D 2]
＠X
I am always honest![sr]I only say what I want to say!
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠X
...Well, at any rate, my mission hasn't changed, but I think I'll take a break from it for a while.
[k]

＠X
Until Du Stallion II is repaired,[sr]I will continue with your training.
[k]

＠X
It's a pleasure to be working with you again, Lily.[sr]I'll continue with the Spartan exercises, so prepare yourself!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Lily
Thank you! Work with me until my Noble Phantasm reaches max level, Ms. X!

I'm not sure it's everything you wanted, but is it satisfactory, [%1]?
[k]

＠X
Shieldy... Mash and Lily are enjoying some combat together. Since it's just us two alone, let's have a talk.
[k]

＠X
Nero said this as well.[sr]That only those that live now can change the future.
[k]

＠X
That's wrong. For people like Lily and me who were born of certain results, we cannot change those results.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠X
Even if Lily were to improve immensely and become a King, the land she would rule has been destroyed.
[k]

？1：...But Nero said it could be changed...

[charaFace D 1]
＠X
She didn't elaborate quite enough.[sr]But yes, that is what Nero said.
[k]

？2：No, that can't be. That's the whole reason for Chaldea.

[charaFace D 0]
＠X
Chaldea and we are different. Chaldea works to return absolutely everything to its true state.
[k]

＠X
It's not to change history...or throw it into chaos. It's the final stronghold for returning human history back to normal.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠X
One day I will become part of Chaldea,[sr]and I look forward to that day.
[k]

？！

＠X
Now listen. No matter what Lily does, she cannot change her destiny.
[k]

＠X
But that process, that's something different. Even if the endpoint is the same, the pathway to it can be chosen.
[k]

＠X
...Take a country that has fallen to ruin.
[k]

＠X
Whether that ruin was tragic or tranquil, only the people of that time know.
[k]

＠X
There is no way for the people of the future to know.[sr]Only the people of that time can actually know what it was like.
[k]

＠X
The things that Lily does will fulfill that possibility. The original King Arthur was unable to fulfill the dream...
[k]

＠X
It is an entirely hypothetical story that left no mark on real history. Only she can make the glorious journey.
