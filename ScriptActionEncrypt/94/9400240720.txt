＠C：Mercédès
...Oh, don't force yourself to move.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
Stay where you are.[sr]Though I doubt you could move at all.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠C：Mercédès
Don't let it bother you.[sr]I've simply done what I felt I must.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠C：Mercédès
Did the wraiths help me for the reason he said...
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
Because of who I was in life?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠C：Mercédès
I am supposed to be the Lord of the seventh Hall of Judgment. One of the obstacles set to slay you.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠C：Mercédès
For some reason I lost that role, as well as my memories.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
I still can't remember.[sr]But...
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠C：Mercédès
I pray that the light shines down upon your path.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
Much of what he says is lies, but one thing he said remains in my heart.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
“Attendre et espérer.” Wait and hope.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠C：Mercédès
...What sad words, but what a strong wish that lives within them...

Hahahaha![sr]Die! Die! Leave nothing behind!

＠Avenger
Without hatred, you are weak![sr]True, you had an advantage over me[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Avenger
But your blade could not touch me, woman.[sr]It was far too kind.

？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠Avenger
Haha. Hahahahaha![sr]How hilarious! Those were her last words?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Avenger
Me, Edmond?
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Avenger
No! No! First the Holy Maiden, then her! I am not him![sr]I am not Edmond Dantès[line 3]
[k]

＠Avenger
That's the name of a miserable, innocent prisoner. The name of a man who was saved...
[k]

＠Avenger
...by a miraculous love[line 3]
[k]

＠Avenger
That is not me.[sr]I am an Avenger! An eternal being of vengeance!
[k]

＠Avenger
The name of a human who lived and died as a man![sr]How could it be worthy of me?
[k]

？1：Is that your True Name?

？！

[charaFace B 5]
＠Avenger
...We're done talking.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Avenger
The Château d'If's role will end soon.[sr]The seven judgments have been destroyed.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Avenger
All that's left is to go outside, into the sunlight. But...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Avenger
No human has escaped the Château d'If.[sr]With one exception.
[k]

＠Avenger
It is the same even now that a million hatreds have reformed this place. Only one may leave.
[k]

？1：But there are two people here.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Avenger
Yes. Yes, there are[line 3]
[k]

？2：I figured this was coming.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Avenger
Very perceptive.[sr]No, I suppose it's to be expected.
[k]

？！

＠Avenger
The one who remains shall become the new Abbé Faria.
[k]

＠Avenger
They will end their life as one who shatters despair and guides towards hope. It's a meaningful way to end one's life.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Avenger
You, or me.[sr]One of us will survive and one of us will die.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Avenger
[line 3]Come, my temporary Master. Prepare yourself.
[k]

＠Avenger
Of course, I have no intention of dying.[sr]I was lucky enough to come back to this world.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Avenger
I will do as I please. I'll make you a second Abbé Faria, and live.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Avenger
Your story will end. It's that simple.
[k]

＠Avenger
Let us end this. In the last act of the play, your soul shall truly die.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Avenger
But if...

To me belongeth Vengeance! I am the avatar of Pride, the Lord of the seventh Hall of Judgment!
