As the descendant of a clan that alchemizes artificial Servants, the work he inherited was truly evil.

I finally figured out what was wrong with you.

You have a tiny shard of crystallized Alternium embedded in your head. It was being used to track me.

That crystal had been receiving mana waves leaking through the cracks of multidimensional space.

It seems, coincidentally, that you were on the same wavelength as someone else's mind. They would appear to be a mage.
