You have Ereshkigal's memories!?[sr]That can't be! How did you...

＠Voice
Oh, never mind! Ereshkigal! Kill her! Shut that foolish Heroic Spirit up before she can say another word!

I even threw in the gift wrapping for free.

Come to think of it, I haven't seen you around in some time. What have you done now...!?

I would prefer not to comment. I've never gotten along well with bullheaded boors like you.

Now is the time to return to your true form. Remember Nergal's Authority? The brilliant light of the sun you once laid claim to?
[k]

Now is the time for you to awaken to the sun's gleaming shine. As they say, no time like the present.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
After all, don't you feel like you could pull that off now?
[k]

＠Dumuzid
If these memories are truly precious to you, you should also start to shine bright.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
Proud goddess of the underworld, there was once a time when you didn't even know what the sun was.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
You knew nothing of the light.[sr]You did not know what it was that you admired.
[k]

＠Dumuzid
Baaa.[sr]But as you are now, you just might be able to shine.

You... How dare you purge me from yourself...[sr]What happened to your responsibilities, Ereshkigal?

How long will you cling to that unseemly Spirit Origin!?

Do you plan to leave the underworld behind and be free? Or perhaps to abandon it for a life on the surface?

How dare you... I forbid it!

But I'm not sticking around for my own sake.[sr]I'm sticking around to protect the underworld!
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Now that I've heard your plans for it,[sr]I realize what my real mistake was.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
It wasn't breaking my oath. It was deciding to let you take over the underworld for me!
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
You don't actually care about the underworld.[sr]You just want a place to call your own.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
A world that exists just to worship and glorify you. No way I'm entrusting my underworld to a god like that!
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
This is a land of tranquility that exists to shelter souls after they die, to protect the longing they still have for their lives!
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
And no one[line 2]human, god, or otherwise[line 2]gets to threaten that!

＠Ereshkigal
I am Ereshkigal of the underworld, the Queen of Kur!
