[line 3]What a ridiculous fight. If I'm gonna get in a punching match it should be with a Servant.

You mean several, right? The more powerful the enemies are, the more joy there is in defeating them, and the greater the profit.

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Well, well. He was a formidable warrior to the very end. True, he was strong, but I'm sure he would've run out of enemies to defeat.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
It goes to show that I need not have worried.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
In fact, you resemble my own subordinates. You've made me feel a little parental affection, or should I say, kingly affection.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
[line 3]Yes. Now let me address the lovely lady over here!
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
In this fight with the speechless iron knights and dolls, you displayed magnificent heroism.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Therefore, a romance with this battle maiden seem inevitable... If I had the time, I would certainly go through with it, but...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
It seems this materialization is but a temporary one, I am destined to return to my former battlefield.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
What a pity. When it comes right down to it, I am too impatient to remain here any longer...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Yes, I must end the boredom here![sr]Farewell, young Master! Away!

Alas...

＠Mash
...I don't know...what to do...
[k]

＠Mash
Humans leave only destruction in their wake, yet even in these times, you, my hero, resist.
[k]

＠Mash
You can stand side-by-side with the dragon slayer Beowulf. You can fight alongside the god slayer Fionn mac Cumhaill.
[k]

＠Mash
When I see you like that, I... I...
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
[line 6]I really don't know what to do.
[k]

？1：Why don't you know what to do?

＠Mash
When you are so heroic...[sr]I can't help...but to...love you...
[k]

＠Mash
I love, I love, I love you.[sr]I love, I love, I love, I love you...
[k]

＠Mash
...I end up...loving you...
[k]


？2：I'm not sure what to say[line 3]

＠Mash
I-I'm...sorry...[sr]...I really will...be more careful.

＠Mash
I will be more careful...

＠Mash
My true name is Brynhild.[sr]Yes, that is the truth. I am not Mash Kyrielight.
[k]

？1：Huh? What the... Really?
？2：As I thought, you aren't Mash.

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠A：Brynhild
...Yes.
[k]

＠A：Brynhild
I was the Valkyrie, the machine, who assisted the great god Odin of northern Europe, yet was transformed into a human woman and met my death. That is I.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠A：Brynhild
Please forgive me. Due to who I was in life, I cannot help but see into your soul...
[k]

＠A：Brynhild
Therefore, I have come to a decision.[sr]My father, Odin... I cannot be your daughter...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠A：Brynhild
I will be a woman carved into human history, I will be a hero's companion.

They may have even been guided to us by the damnable blue flame. Either way...
