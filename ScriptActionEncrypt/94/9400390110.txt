Yes. It's an ancient manuscript, like an old book.[sr]We call it a scroll.

No, I'm not some kind of bibliomaniac, okay!?[sr]I was asked to bring it from the warehouse, so I did.

This was an item brought into Chaldea and kept there because it was thought to be a precious artifact affiliated with a certain person.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

That means it is a catalyst for summoning. You said you were asked. So, was it for some kind of experiment?

Good morning, Senpai.[sr]...You're dressed a bit flashy, aren't you?

Party? ...Here?[sr]I don't think any have been planned...

You were probably given the wrong information.[sr]...Let's interrogate Caesar later.

[charaFace B 3]
＠Mash
Which part of the conversation did you hear!?
[k]

[charaFace B 13]
＠Mash
Let me see... Although I am still young and inexperienced, there are still smells I love, or I want to fall in love with.
[k]

＠Mash
The smell of soil, the smell of green pastures, the smell of fresh-baked bread. Fou, you smell a little like sunshine.
[k]

[charaFace B 11]

And, well, when I'm in your room, Senpai...sometimes...[sr]I feel dizzy...

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
All right! Now, let's start over.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sanzang
Let me introduce myself. I'm Xuanzang Sanzang. Despite how I look, I'm a monk. A proper monk that follows the teachings of the Buddha.
[k]


＠Sanzang
I'm currently in the middle of a journey to the far western land, Tianzhu, under the decree of the emperor of the Tang Dynasty. As for my mission... Ummm...
[k]


？1：To get the precious scriptures?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Sanzang
What, how do you know? Oh no, I guess I was showing too much of my virtuousness...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
[line 3]That's right, just like you've said!
[k]


？2：To collect...seven...dragon orbs?

[charaFace A 5]
＠Sanzang
You mean to materialize the wish granter that could fulfill any wish by offering the blood of those seeking it?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sanzang
Too bad, I won't be swayed by such an easy temptation. But, you're on the right track[line 3] Yes, I am collecting something.
[k]

＠Sanzang
As for what I'm collecting...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
Scriptures! I have a duty to collect scriptures! Scriptures that can be found on the way to Tianzhu! But...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanzang
The demon I've subdued to guide me ran... I mean got separated from me. And my horse got eaten... I mean I gave it a break.
[k]

＠Sanzang
I've been lost... I mean fighting by myself for days and then... I ran into you! I was so scared...
[k]


？1：I see. Very virtuous.
？2：Maybe it was too soon for you to travel?

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Sanzang
What? You got a problem with a virtuous monk like me!?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sanzang
By. The. Way. Isn't it about time you tell me about yourself?

It's all rather grandiose and hard to believe, but... you're[sr][%1] of Chaldea, which is from the future...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sanzang
I believe your story. This must be part of the Buddha's guidance... I'm sure.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
The Buddha exists beyond space and time. He could send a messenger from the future to the past.
[k]

＠Sanzang
So, how do you go back to Chaldea?[sr]Don't you have any tools to send an emergency signal?
[k]


？1：Actually, no.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sanzang
You're lost! Oh my, so you're lost too![sr]Good, good, we're rather alike, you and I!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Sanzang
...Ahem. I mean, uh, now I know the reason behind our encounter, [%1].
[k]


？2：I'm still not sure that I traveled to the past[line 3]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Sanzang
Then again, you can't pinpoint your exact coordinates right now. In that case, we're just wasting time sitting here arguing.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
When I become great, I will say this: Do good deeds, punish bad deeds, and listen to Sanzang.
[k]

＠Sanzang
So, [%1]?[sr]Become my disciple!
[k]


？1：...Why?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanzang
Uh... I mean... I'm...still in the middle of the journey...[sr]And I've got a long way to go...
[k]

＠Sanzang
I've got no food... My tummy is beyond empty... But all worldly things are transitory... [charaFace A 5]Anyway, I need a disciple!
[k]


？2：If you will make me your number one disciple.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
Of course! Easy peasy![sr]You are my number one disciple! Yay!
[k]

？！


[charaFace A 5]
＠Sanzang
...To tell the truth, I remember a little bit. I think I've experienced this journey to Tianzhu once before.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanzang
But I can't remember the specifics.[sr]Just like you don't know left from right here.
[k]


[charaFace A 1]
＠Sanzang
It's very strange, but this must be some kind of meaningful fate for the both of us.
[k]

＠Sanzang
This journey to the west is a trial from the Buddha.[sr]So he won't give you an answer. He won't do anything.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Most likely there's a reason for this.[sr]To send you back to Chaldea[line 3]
[k]

＠Sanzang
That's the challenge I was given.[sr]For you, it's a gift from on high.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sanzang
So... From now on, you can call me “Master”!
[k]


？1：“Master” is taken, so... Mentor!

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanzang
Ugh, I feel like I've been called that before...[sr]No, you must properly address me as Master!
[k]


？2：Don't overdo it, Sanzang-chan.

[charaFace A 2]
＠Sanzang
Ugh, just so you know, I won't take a rebellious pupil like you to nirvana!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sanzang
Anyway, scriptures won't just fall into our hands.[sr]Come, let's head to the land in the far west, Tianzhu![sr]GO WEST! GO!
