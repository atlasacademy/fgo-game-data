Is it Singularity F? I thought we already recovered the Holy Grail at those coordinates.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Not Fuyuki, but next to it. You can see a strange distortion, right?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's been under observation for several days.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
At first, I thought it was a small error caused by the fluctuation of Singularity F's repair.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But it wouldn't disappear even after a considerate amount of time. Then I tried changing Sheba's observation angle...
[k]


[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
There are signs of life![sr]But these coordinates should have been incinerated!
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Dr. Roman
Oh, and that's not all.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I only detected a few life forms,[sr]but I picked up countless moving objects.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
On top of that, no matter how much I adjust Sheba, I can't get a read on the scale and era of these coordinates.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's a complete black box. We won't know what's going on unless we Rayshift there.
[k]

？1：So, is it a new Singularity?

＠Dr. Roman
I'm sorry, but I can't even be sure about that. Humanity has been destroyed, and the outside world incinerated.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
At least before 2018, when humans were still alive.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The cause of such atrocities, what made them possible, was our loss of coordinates called the Foundations of Humanity[line 3]
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Historical events that became the essential support pillars of our human history...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...such as those that occurred in France and Rome.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
In response, Chaldea prevented the collapse of these foundations by Rayshifting into them from outside the time flow.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even if it's already incinerated in the proper timeline, Chaldea can Rayshift to a time before the destruction, and prevent its collapse.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[%1], just think of what you've been doing as repairing a completely incinerated scroll.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
However, these coordinates are different.[sr]They don't exist in any history.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Think of it as something that's lost. A hole eaten away by bugs.
[k]

？2：As usual, right?

[charaFace B 1]
＠Dr. Roman
Yes, simply put, that's exactly it![sr]You're really reliable, [%1]!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I was ready to explain a lot of things,[sr]but in short, you should take a chance on everything!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
...Hmm, Doctor. I request further explanation on what you just said.

[k]

＠Da Vinci
If the seven Singularities are like stains on the scroll we call human history, that fake Singularity is like a hole in that scroll.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I don't understand how it happened, but it's luring the Servants and trapping them in there.

Speaking of which, did you notice that Chaldea is a lot more quiet than usual?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Servants that [%1] successfully summoned and formed a contract with...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
They're receiving magical energy from Chaldea and setting up anchors for their existence all around this base.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You can call it a temporary incarnation.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If they keep using magical energy from their[sr]Master each time they're summoned into battle, [%1] would be all dried up already.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Dr. Roman
So, in order to lessen the burden cast on [%1],
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Chaldea is using 40% of its power to sustain the contract with each Servant.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
As long as Grand Order is still in effect, these Servants have made Chaldea their home.

It wouldn't cause any harm even if left as it is... However, it's also true the Servants are not coming back.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[%1]. Mash.[sr]I want you to investigate these coordinates.

＠Dr. Roman
Rayshifting anywhere other than a Singularity is an exception, and requires the authorization of the former Director, but...

Will you do it?
