＠???
Hey, I've done my fair share of helping behind the scene.
[k]

＠???
To reach the very depth of the Abyss, I had no choice but to leave my physical body in another place.
[k]

＠???
Indeed...a certain Demon God had sought out superstition. It tried to have the god from the Abyss descend upon this land...
[k]

＠???
This attempt ended in failure, but for an existence that was empty in the first place, the momentary opportunity was enough.
[k]

＠???
Enough, as far as the course of time and space is concerned, by learning of this earth and merging with[sr]Mr. Hokusai's soul.
[k]

＠???
The Demon God has not given up, and it is pursuing another attempt. I did not see or understand this until I was submerged within the abyssal void.
[k]

＠???
We must prevent it. But it appears that this is not something that happens in the future, at least not from Chaldea's point of view...
[k]

＠???
Well, anyway...
[k]

＠???
Mr. Hokusai. As unintentional as it may have been, you have spearheaded the Demon God's conspiracy...
[k]

＠???
I'm impressed you managed to prevent it from going out of control and rampaging across reality.
[k]

＠???
You and Oei have my deepest gratitude.[sr]Not to mention the mage of the real world.
[k]

＠???
...It's truly a puzzling thing.[sr]Someone who is neither a mage nor a fallen saint...
[k]

＠???
...was able to wield the power of the great evil god, even if it was just a part of it, for themselves...
