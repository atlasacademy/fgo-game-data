Oh, it's a wonderful watercourse.[sr]Thank you, Master.

＠Marie
I especially like the part that looks like a bridge.[sr]Hehe, it is like Pont du Gard.

Pont du Gard... A famous stone aqueduct that crosses the Gardon River in France.
[k]

＠Mash
It is also a World Heritage site, if I'm not mistaken.

＠Altria
Ahem. It must be a work of Roman architecture.
[k]

＠Altria
I do respect other countries' cultures, Master.[sr]But as you command a great number of Servants...
[k]

＠Altria
I must advise that favoring a specific culture too much can cause unnecessary friction.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Altria
It seems you have become a sort of Romaniac.
[k]


？1：I didn't mean to be obsessed over it.

？2：But Rome is the best, Rome.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Altria
Ugh, could it be? Maybe Master is being brainwashed by King Romulus!? This is a grave situation!

Humph, no. Master is actually a Francophile, right?[sr]This is a French structure, after all.
[k]


？1：No, not really...
？2：Vive la France!

[charaFace F 1]
＠Marie
Yes, yes! Vive la France!

(Sigh) Master is so...

[charaFace B 3]
＠Altria
Perhaps I should assert myself and request for something British to be built...
