Huh, guess that's all it took to open the gate. Not bad, me. Pretty good for something you just made up.

＠Shadow Santa
Still, there's no way you'll stop the current underworld boss like this. You guys are WAY too by the book here, y'know?

？1：What do you mean? Do you know something?

[charaFace D 1]

＠Shadow Santa
Who, me? Nah, I don't know shit.[sr]I'm just a sacrificial lamb!

？2：Tell us more! Who is this “boss”?

＠Shadow Santa
That'd be Ereshkigal, the only boss of the underworld.[sr]Who the hell else? Don't you already know her?

＠Shadow Santa
Just a heads-up, there's a goddess you're familiar with at the next gate. You know, the one who's bright, cheerful, and really into pro wrestling?
[k]

＠Shadow Santa
I bet she'd be willing to fill you in some more.[sr]She's a total free spirit, after all.

Lucky for us, I'm sure a goddess will understand our circumstances. Let's hurry on, [%1].

Next time, we should find out more about the underworld boss Shadow Santa spoke of for sure.
