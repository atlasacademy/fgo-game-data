My training is going well again today, Master and Ms. X![sr]It seems like the strength of my Noble Phantasm is about to improve!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠X
...Sigh. Lily is so very earnest.[sr]I'm glad her training is going well, but...
[k]

＠X
My quota is not being met.[sr]Maybe I should find bigger prey...

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I've had a change of mind myself.[sr]I think now is the time to clear up that other question.
[k]

？1：Ah, you mean about X's Class.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
No, not about that... To be honest, it's something that's really been bothering me...

？2：Ah, you mean about who X really is.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mash
That's right, Master. Of course I'd like to know her Class, but I'd at least like to know her origins.
[k]

So...you want to know my origins. Do you have some ulterior motive for wanting to know this, Lily?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Lily
No... It's just rather painful to know nothing about someone who has helped me so much.
[k]

＠Lily
I just thought that the least I could do to thank you was make a popular dish or famous sweets from your hometown...
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠X
...Oh, I see.[sr]I guess I'm the only one suspicious of others...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠X
If that's what you want, then let me tell you all about it![sr][%1], and Shieldy, you listen as well.
[k]

＠X
I have nothing to hide. I am a Servant that comes from outer space! I am a Heroic Spirit that comes from a future Servant-verse!

＠Lily
Hah...[sr]So, Ms. X, is that the same as the Throne of Heroes?
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠X
No. The Servant-verse is not some boring warehouse like the Throne of Heroes!
[k]

＠X
It is where Servants conduct Servant-like deeds with a space-like world view. That is to say, it is a universe.
[k]

＠X
It's a world where we have been set free from the burden of our origins and can truly do whatever we like.
[k]

？1：Okay, I have no idea what you're talking about.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Lily
Me neither! But it sounds fun![sr]I think that universe seems all right.
[k]

？2：In that universe, do people become zombies?

[charaFace D 0]
＠X
Of course. We have everything from suspense, melodramas, and mysteries. It's only natural that we have a horror route as well.
[k]

＠X
When that golden nudist said, “I am mankind's oldest zombie!” and stuff, I was sure this world was done for.
[k]

＠X
At least that's what I thought, but somehow he made it back to his own world.
[k]

＠X
No matter how reckless the adventure...
[k]

＠X
“[line 3]I've been through a lot, but I've returned to this town.”
[k]

＠X
As long as you say that when you come back, most of the time people would just pretend nothing has happened.
[k]

Let's put aside talk of Servant-verse.[sr]What do you mean that you came from the future?
[k]

＠Mash
Unlike Rayshift, is that rocket a genuine time machine?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠X
A time machine? Oh, you mean, can it make time jumps?
[k]

＠X
Well, I'm pretty sure it can. It warps, after all. I mean, a journey through space is impossible unless you can travel faster than light.

Well...no, the incredible one is whoever it was that made Du Stallion II...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Lily
But why did you come from the future?[sr]Did you make some mistake while steering your ship?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠X
How rude! My piloting skills are perfect![sr]I am a Saber after all!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠X
I came to this era to save the world. The future that I am in is facing a crisis of destruction now.
[k]

＠X
For some reason, our existence is on the verge of being destroyed. I came here to eradicate the cause of it...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠X
But I couldn't stand to ignore you Lily.[sr]That's why I'm your teacher and training you.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Lily
I...can't believe this.
[k]

＠Lily
Even when you've been given the mission to save the world, you can still make time to train me...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Lily
I have nothing but respect for you![sr]Ms. X is just like you said, a Saber of all Sabers!
[k]

[charaFace D 3]

Uh, well... Yeah, I guess.[sr]...I am a Saber, so what of it?

[k]

？1：You're right. But X is a good Saber.
？2：You think so? I mean, X is “that” Saber.

？！

What are you talking about, Caster?[sr]Do you really think she can even read the signs?

First of all, since that is obviously a spacecraft, we are facing aliens. They can't understand our language.
[k]

＠Emiya
It's just one nutty person facing off against another nutty person.

With kindness, sincerity, and passion! Though we may be of different lands, the feelings within our hearts are similar!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Nero
So first, let us negotiate with a smile. There is not a living thing around that cannot understand that.
[k]

＠Nero
It is a visitor from the sky, after all!

＠Nero
They are most certainly overflowing with[sr]romance, passion, and a taste of the future!

I will now proclaim with complete confidence, the owner of that rocket is a civilized person who hates war!
