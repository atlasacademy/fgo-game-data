Ah, Saint Valentine's Day.

＠Vlad III
Very well. There is no need for me to tout tradition with a custom that has strongly rooted itself in this land.
[k]

＠Vlad III
I most graciously accept.

＠Vlad III
It's a plush mountain goat.
[k]

＠Vlad III
I am a bit apprehensive in handing these out to the children here because of its origin story.
[k]

＠Vlad III
That's right. It's a scapegoat. A stuffed toy of a mountain goat that was used as a sacrifice.
[k]

＠Vlad III
It may not be a consolation to you, but in case we cannot be there for you...

＠Vlad III
This stuffed toy shall offer its life in your place.[sr]Why don't you sleep next to it?

＠Vlad III
...You don't want to sacrifice it because it's cute, you say?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Vlad III
...Hm. Well that is a problem.[sr]I shouldn't have made it so cute...
