＠Da Vinci
Hey, sorry to call you up.[sr]Did you wait long, [%1]?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
As you know, I am the universal genius and peerless artist. I do everything extravagantly, and do not like things that are too easy.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So, first, I identified the situation. It's Valentine's Day...[sr]It would be uninspired to give this to you at Chaldea.
[k]

？1：I didn't think I'd receive anything from you...

[charaFace A 3]
＠Da Vinci
Oh yeah? It may be surprising, but I am pretty affectionate. I'm not cold enough to ignore those for whom I have feelings.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Valentine's Day is a day to express one's affection, or it's a day to begin relationships...is it not?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Da Vinci
Then I shall throw myself into it wholeheartedly.[sr]But everything must be done beautifully, like me.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Well, no matter what anyone says, I cannot deny that this is a modern event. Luckily, that is not a problem for me, so long as it is interesting!
[k]

？2：It's like we're on a date.

[charaFace A 5]
＠Da Vinci
A perfect response, [%1]! I knew you had a good eye! It was worth dressing up for!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Ha. Today is a special day, after all.[sr]I've dressed up in full attire.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Da Vinci
What? I'm already beautiful, but today I'm so beautiful that your eyes are going to explode? Aw! You silly, you! You're such a flatterer!
[k]

？！

＠Da Vinci
My intro got a little long-winded.[sr]So, let me simply say this:
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Cheers to your fortuitous luck thus far and I pray for more to come! Take my greatest, genius chocolate!

？1：Da Vinci, this! This is...!
？2：Why is the chocolate shining!?

？！

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 7]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Da Vinci
Why? Because anything so utterly perfect must shine. Like, bliiing.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I maybe got a bit carried away with the presentation, but don't worry, it should still taste good! I didn't do a taste test though...
[k]

？1：Thank you very much.
？2：I'll place it in the art museum here.

？！

[charaFace A 3]
＠Da Vinci
Ah. Hmmm. I see. So these are the effects of Valentine's Day.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I never knew that a simple word of gratitude could warm one's heart so much. Ah, how stimulating! How wanton!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Da Vinci
But if I just act in my usual eccentric ways, the day will be ruined. I'm heading back to my studio to rest!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Don't worry. This feeling of passion should die down in a little while! I'll be back, so until then, be moved by my art!
[k]
