＠Marie
Are those different pizza types? So many variations even though it's already so good! ...How intriguing.

＠Marie
It's a mystery why Sanson and the others didn't let me eat something so tasty. Were they just being mean?
[k]


？1：Maybe it had something to do with etiquette...?

[charaFace F 0]
＠Marie
Hmm? But you normally eat bread with your hands.[sr]This appears no different to me.
[k]


？2：Maybe it had something to do with the calories...

＠Marie
Really? But I can't really eat that much anyway, so I think it's just right for me...

It may be an image issue. A princess eating pizza doesn't really...you know...

Perhaps Sanson and the others didn't know what pizza tasted like.

Oh! Hee hee, you may be right.

I bet they both hate getting their hands greasy. They'd be like, “It interferes with our work,” or something like that.

＠Marie
Okay. When we get back to Chaldea, let's call both of them and hold a pizza party, shall we?
[k]

＠Marie
We will have all kinds of pizza and cola... I wonder how they will react? Hee hee hee...
[k]


？1：Don't forget to invite me.
？2：Looking forward to it.
