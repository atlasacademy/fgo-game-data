Y-yes. Hm. Is it for that Valentine's thing?
[k]

＠Li Shuwen
I do know of it. Chaldea's all riled up about it.[sr]Though it's mostly the women who are excited.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Li Shuwen
But chocolate...I don't usually come across this sort of thing.
[k]

＠Li Shuwen
So how do you eat it?
[k]

？1：Maybe with tea?
？2：Pair it with some bitter green tea.
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Li Shuwen
Ah, good idea. While you're here, join me, Master.

Sorry it's not particularly good tea.

...Now then, I shall have this chocolate of yours.[se ade13][wt 0.5][charaFace A 1][sr]Hm. Delicious.
[k]

？1：I'm glad.

Change of subject, Master.

＠Li Shuwen
In one of the stories about my cause of death, I hear poison was put in my tea.

...Kaka. Don't get so tense.

All we need to do is to be on guard.[sr]That's all I wanted to say.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Li Shuwen
As you know, numerous heroes met their demise with poison.
[k]

＠Li Shuwen
To trust others, one should still hold some suspicion.[sr]The more you want to trust, the more you need to carry suspicion.
[k]

＠Li Shuwen
Though this may not make much sense to you since you've been through numerous battles trusting others.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Li Shuwen
Ah, just treat it as an old man's rambling.[sr]For now.
