Is this really going to work?[sr]He seems like a very cold person...
[k]

？1：Yeah, he's definitely a cold-blooded mage.
？2：Yeah, well, he's going bald, so...

Leave it to me. But [%1], I'd like you to let me handle all negotiations with Lord Kayneth.

＠El-Melloi
I'll keep a telepathic channel open so we can communicate in secret, but keep your mouth shut at all times. Got it?
[k]

？1：I'll let you handle it.
？2：Let's see what you can do.

？！

I spoke to Archisorte last night. You were lying when you said you were acting on Reines' behalf.

But you agreed to meet with us anyway.[sr]Which means...

＠Kayneth
There's something else I want to ask you about.[sr]Your statements about Caster last night...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Kayneth
Why were you able to know the Holy Church's actions in advance?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Because for me, it happened long ago in the past.
[k]

＠Kayneth
What?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
The morning after the Servant battle at the wharf, the Overseer speaks to all participants and offers a special reward for the first to kill Caster.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
...But that's not all I know.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
You originally intended to summon Iskandar for this battle. You even had the catalyst for it.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
However, it was stolen by a student at the Clock Tower, Waver Velvet...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
...and you were forced to summon Diarmuid Ua Duibhne instead.
[k]

[charaFace F 6]
＠Kayneth
How did you...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
And it's not you that's providing the magical energy for that Servant, it's your fiancée Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
You have her in another room to keep her safe.[sr]Well, it's good to be careful.
[k]

[charaFace F 6]
＠Kayneth
...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠El-Melloi
Oh, speaking of Lady Sola-Ui.[sr]There was a love letter draft left in your study.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
I believe it began, “To my beautiful beloved, your eyes glisten like the morning dew...”
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Kayneth
Shut up! Shut up! Enough![sr]Who are you!?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠El-Melloi
I wasn't lying when I said I was acting on behalf of Lady Reines.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
But I will only officially receive that duty four years from now.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
And thus, everything I told you is part of my memories of the past.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Kayneth
...Humph.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
You're taking this seriously. I suppose I should've expected that from the leader of the Archibald family.
[k]

＠Kayneth
A traveler through time, huh? I've heard that some are working very hard at that research.
[k]

＠Kayneth
I thought it was stupid nonsense that would never come true... Even so, I need a more believable explanation.
[k]

＠Kayneth
What you're saying is similar to True Magic.[sr]Of course, there must be quite the backstory involved.
[k]



[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
I'll give you an overview.[sr]Let me begin.
