How can you say such a thing after taking down X in a sneak attack?

If you don't want to fight, put down the sword![sr]Fortunately, X is only unconscious.

Why in the world are you protecting X, Lily?[sr]I'm so bothered that my attacks are off.
[k]

＠Z
You shouldn't be protecting her! You should end her life![sr]To X, you were nothing more than an object for elimination.
[k]

＠Z
The reason she trained you was because you weren't a threat. She was laughing inside about how much of a pushover you are.
[k]

＠Z
How can I know that, you ask?[sr]Of course I know, because that's what I think!
[k]

＠Z
I hate to admit it, but I'm a terrible Saber![sr]However, I know it!
[k]

＠Z
To X, you are nothing but a tool! A nice-looking laborer that would help her repair her spacecraft!

Which is to say, I'm an entirely useless Saber to Ms. X![sr]From the beginning, I was a knight of no consequence to her!

Yet she helped me train and grow stronger![sr]She never laughed at my dream!

No matter what Ms. X's objective is,[sr]I will always be her ally!

And[line 3][sr]This holy sword shines bright to protect all those I love!
