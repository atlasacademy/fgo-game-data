＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Oh hey, it's Master.[sr]What is it? Whatcha here for today?
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Sightseeing in a ruin long since forgotten by mankind?[sr]Or a pleasure trip through a town burning from the fires of war?
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
I don't care either way.[sr]I like both sad and chaotic places.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Well, whatever the problem, I'm not gonna be of help![sr]If I manage to get one chump of an enemy, that's pretty good for me!
[k]

？1：That's not it.
？2：Today, it's about this.

Hee hee hee. A simple sentimental gift deserves a simple return gift!

It's nothing big. It's just a silly old thing.[sr]Just sell it to line your pockets.
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Sell it for next to nothing, and learn how sad and empty it feels when it gets thrown in the trash!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Well, that is neither here nor there. As for this thing you gave me, I am very happy about it, so I'll eat it up in commemoration!
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Ah, a chocolate from Master! I wonder how sweet it is.[sr]I bet it's as sweet as a spoonful of cake frosting!
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Hee hee hee. I might die of the sweetness! Oh, by the way, I can't die from charms, so don't get the wrong idea!
[k]

＠Aŋra Mainiiu
Saying hilarious things like dying and not dying from the sweetness of chocolate... Maybe I should try my hand at comedy, Master!
