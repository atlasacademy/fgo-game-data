Welcome to my room!
[k]

＠Andersen
Chaldea's rooms are all so dull. But when the writers' group works within it, it transforms to something stupendous!
[k]

＠Andersen
And I see that you have come to make fun of my work, you twisted Master, [%1]!
[k]

＠Andersen
But too bad. As can see, my writing is at a standstill! Tell Mash that “The Little Mermaid 3” is never going to happen!

？1：He's sure doing as he pleases...
？2：He sure has a big head...

＠Andersen
Hmph. To be honest, I just can't think of anything to write. Some ideas may have come up, but none of them have any depth.
[k]

＠Andersen
We did conclude a grand battle, after all. Ordinary events do not surprise me, nor do I feel affected by them.
[k]

＠Andersen
It's enough to make me hope for an absolutely horrible, cosmically wicked being to pop up[line 3]

＠Andersen
No, no, slip of the tongue.[sr]Speaking about something might make it so.
[k]

＠Andersen
...Hm. Looking for some sewage to watch to stave off my boredom, I must really be desperate.
[k]

＠Andersen
So, what do you want? Much as I don't mind a bit of boredom, you do know that even I am not eccentric enough to tolerate your chit-chat.
[k]

？1：Chocolates.
？2：To show my gratitude to you.

？！


[charaFace A 5]

＠Andersen
Chocolates!? For me!?

＠Andersen
I...I see. I've never thought about using this as a topic, but...I see...
[k]

＠Andersen
So this is what it feels like to actually be gifted something. Well, this was a precious experience fit to be a sample case.
[k]

？1：Are you blushing?

？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Andersen
Of course not! This is a well-deserved reward for me![sr]Do you know how tough it is working for you?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Andersen
Contracting with you is absolutely not worth it. Don't you dare think that a single chocolate would make us even.
[k]

＠Andersen
...Well, it doesn't sit well with me if I'm only on the receiving end. Right. Take this.

I'm not advertising for Maeterlinck, but I like the topic of a blue bird.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Andersen
I bought it because I needed one at the time, but it doesn't function well, and I left it sitting there.
[k]

＠Andersen
Even something like this might come in handy, although I'm sure only game developers use mice nowadays!
