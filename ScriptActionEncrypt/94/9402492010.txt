(Sigh...) I really thought I'd[sr]managed to avoid this for once...
[k]

＠A：???
Oh, uh, right. I guess I'm Katagiri Medumoto?[sr]There's something about the Seven Spears in there, too.

？1：You know...that outfit's something else, isn't it.

＠Katagiri Medumoto
I don't know why I keep getting[sr]caught up in these things...
[k]

？2：I guess this gives you the GUDAGUDA hat trick.

[charaFace A 5]

＠Katagiri Medumoto
Yes, yes. Let's not think about that.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠Katagiri Medumoto

＠Katagiri Medumoto
I'd heard there were talks about that, but apparently they were scrapped because of deadline issues.
[k]

＠Katagiri Medumoto
I'm not sure what that was about,[sr]but honestly, it came as a relief.

＠Katagiri Medumoto
Anyway, I still have a lot of reading I'd like to do, so let's get this over with and then I can go back to my room. And my books.

[charaFace A 2]

＠Katagiri Medumoto
Come on! Oh! And don't forget! I'm weak to Assassins, so make sure to put some on your team to make this faster!
[k]

＠Katagiri Medumoto
Also Alter Egos!
