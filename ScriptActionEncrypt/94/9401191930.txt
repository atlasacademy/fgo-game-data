...Yes, I am dreadfully ashamed, but before I knew it...well, I became as you see me now...
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
A pathetic woman whose body was stolen by Zepar.[sr]One who had no other option but to fade away.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Like everyone else on Seraphix, I was just another victim of SE.RA.PH... At least, I should have been.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
It was at Zepar's whim that I became what I am...[sr]Became SE.RA.PH itself... Who'd have thought...

[charaFace A 4]

That's right. The Demon God Pillar's malice transformed Seraphix into my own body.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Sessyoin Kiara

[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
For what feels like eternity, I have been attacked, broken, and abandoned by countless Heroic Spirits.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
It has gone beyond my wildest imaginings...a dream, a fantasy...

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
Ah... “Parallel worlds” is it? Yes... “Chronicle Theoretical Phenomenon” and the like? Complex concepts.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
That is how I came to know about another version of me, one among the countless number to exist.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
And in her world, distant in time and space, the moon itself was a Holy Grail called the Mooncell Automaton.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
In a deep, dark space known as the Far Side of the Moon, that version of me was able to claim the Grail.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Among the innumerable versions of me in numberless universes, she was the most...unique. Zepar was very, very pleased with her. So much so that he linked us together.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
I...I who did nothing but suffer as Seraphix fell into a frenzy...
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
...and into the other “me”, the one who acquired the Mooncell for herself.

As a result of this link, we became one and the same.

You see, although Zepar managed to convert Seraphix into SE.RA.PH, he lacked the means to run it.

＠Sessyoin Kiara
...And so I had no choice but to rely on help from you and BB, who had hacked SE.RA.PH on the Far Side of the Moon.

Cool story, girl, but just one thing: where's Zepar now? You talked a lot about him before.

You say that SE.RA.PH and your body are one and the same. So like, how many Servants have you munched on so far?
