So this is...Fuyuki before it was in flames?
[k]

＠Fou
Fou, fou!

？1：Looks peaceful.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes. Seeing how vibrant this city is...[sr]Somehow I feel very relieved.
[k]

？2：Is it rare for you?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
Oh no. I've seen the scenery of modern Japan during the incident of Ogawa-heim already. There's not much difference.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
But to think in 10 years, catastrophe would visit a quiet town like this...

You shouldn't be too sentimental. We exist in a world where everything's been incinerated, not just this town.

＠Mash
Y-You are right... But...

＠El-Melloi
My apologies, I could've worded it better. Yes, normal life is hard to come by, but don't get obsessed over it.

＠El-Melloi
Fearing the inevitable tragedy like the catastrophe of war would only slow you down.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Because we fight as we are confronted with the destruction of mankind's past and future.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
What I meant was, we should keep that in mind, and prepare ourselves for any situation.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Take this instance for example. You probably think there won't be any threat in a peaceful residential district at a time where everybody is asleep, correct?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
That's right. To be honest, I find it hard to believe this place was the site for a Holy Grail War...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
That perception is too naive. In a fight between mages, first you must question everything you see. For example...

Assassin Servant!? Was that Presence Concealment!? But even so that was way too concealed!

＠El-Melloi
Are you asking how is it possible for me to see through your Presence Concealment? Well, I couldn't.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
However, I do know from my investigation that the Assassin in the Fourth Holy Grail War could split into multiple entities and monitored the entirety of Fuyuki.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
I knew we'd get caught in your surveillance network seeing how flashy Rayshifts can be. Then it's only natural for you to come scouting.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Now that you're in my Stone Sentinel Maze, there's no point in you using Presence Concealment.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
Now, [%1], it's time to put up a fight. I'll explain everything later.
