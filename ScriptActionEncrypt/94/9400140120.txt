＠A：Mash
We have annihilated them.[sr]Well done, Master.

＠B：Archer
...How humiliating.[sr]I was hardly any help at all. I'm so ashamed.
[k]

[charaTalk A]
＠A：Mash
N-No, not at all.[sr]I'm just glad we're all right.
[k]

？1：You seemed like you had doubts.

[charaTalk B]
＠B：Archer
...You have a keen eye.[sr]That's exactly right. I...have doubts about fighting.
[k]

？2：Don't you want to fight?

＠B：Archer
A skilled Master must be able to understand a Servant, even if the Servant is not their own.
[k]

＠B：Archer
That's right. For me[line 2]battle carries only melancholy with it.
[k]

？！

[charaTalk A]
＠A：Mash
Why is that?
[k]

[charaTalk B]
＠B：Archer
I know not my True Name, nor how many Holy Grail Wars I fought, nor how many I emerged from victorious.
[k]

＠B：Archer
...But I don't think I have been defeated.[sr]I have the utmost confidence in my abilities.
[k]

＠B：Archer
If I suffered a terrible defeat, Master certainly would have ordered me to commit suicide.
[k]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 6]
＠A：Mash
T-Talk about confidence![sr]But what he says is not a lie, Senpai!
[k]

[charaTalk B]
＠B：Archer
Perhaps I remained undefeated when I was alive as well. That is precisely why it is all feels so empty.
[k]

＠B：Archer
Whether I am victorious or defeated...
[k]

＠B：Archer
It is all just an infinitesimal ship washed away by the enormous waves of time.
[k]

＠B：Archer
The joy of victory has no meaning.[sr]The humiliation of defeat has no meaning.
[k]

＠B：Archer
Therefore, nothing has any meaning.
[k]

？1：Even your life now?

＠B：Archer
...That's right. It is not easy for me to say, but that is the present condition I am in.
[k]

＠B：Archer
If it were not for your presence, Master,[sr]I most likely would have abandoned the battle.
[k]

？2：Even death?

＠B：Archer
I am a Servant to begin with... I am sure I belonged to the warrior class long before as well.
[k]

＠B：Archer
Therefore, I have no fear of death.
[k]

？！

That's not true, Archer.[sr]You are not a warrior unafraid of death.

The man you are now is not someone unafraid of death.[sr]You merely have not seen death.
[k]

＠Lancer
You achieved so much glory so easily and with so little challenge that you ended up tired of life.
[k]

＠Lancer
Your philosophy has led you to nothing more than desperation. You merely have a low opinion of your own existence.
[k]

＠Lancer
That's not even martyrdom.[sr]I won't allow you to take that path!

[line 2]Now that's a little more like it.[sr]That fury. That unreasonable malevolence.
[k]

＠Lancer
That arrogance is what makes you who you are. That aura of righteous anger is most fitting for the man who carries that bow.
[k]

＠Lancer
Fire away without reservation.[sr]Come on, don't hold back.
[k]

＠Lancer
I won't pull any punches either.[sr]I will run my shadow lance through your throat!
