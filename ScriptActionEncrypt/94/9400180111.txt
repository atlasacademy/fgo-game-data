Hmm, that was some good exercise, wasn't it Master?[sr]However, what is this Servant?
[k]

＠Shakespeare
It looks like a Shadow Servant, but with a much paler color...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Shakespeare
More than anything[line 2]

？1：This...smells like chocolate...
？2：This... sweet fragrance...

Yes, that's it![sr]I know what they are now[line 2]

Oh my, Master. Say, did you happen to see a chocolate sprinting around here?
[k]

？1：...What did you say?
？！

[charaFace C 5]
＠Mata Hari
A chocolate I said. I am not sure what happened but...
[k]

＠Mata Hari
...the chocolate I melted in a bain-marie​ started to fuse together, took human form, and all of a sudden ran away.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
It sure is mysterious, isn't it?[sr]What should we do, Master?

In other words, let's call the entities we've just met “Choco-Servants!”

Now what do I do... I put some a secret spell[sr]on it that allows it to turn into a jewel.
[k]

？1：That's way too magical...
？2：What kind of alchemist are you?
？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Mata Hari
Hehehe, if you pour enough love into your chocolate,[sr]it's only natural for it to do that.

[charaFace C 1]
＠Mata Hari
Please be sure to remember that because it's very important, Master♪

I have called upon some Servants with unusual senses of smell to track down those chocolates.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Let's use their scarily keen senses of smell derived from their unpopulari... I mean jealousy, and take back those chocolates!
[k]

？1：You're behind this aren't you!?
？2：I know what your final Ascension looks like...
？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Shakespeare
Hahahaha, you sure like to jest, Master!

...If I were behind this commotion, I would surely make[sr]the chocolate escape with more drama, more tragedy!

Therefore, I promise I am only acting out of the kindness in my heart.

Ah, I can see distrust in my Master's eyes. Heh heh, I guess my legacy can be both good and evil at times!

＠Dr. Roman
Ahhh, heaters and blankets are the best on a cold day like this... Good, it feels so good...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I know I have a lot to do, but snuggling in this blanket next to a heater somehow makes me feel like everything will be all right.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Truly, this just feels too good...[sr]No wonder humanity has fallen...
