＠Scáthach
It's about time we set our sights on a stable food supply.
[k]

＠Scáthach
I'm talking about a field.[sr]We shall cultivate a vegetable field.
[k]


？1：We're starting with vegetables?
？！


＠Scáthach
Yes. It's easier to grow vegetables than grain, so that's what we'll start with.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Master can choose what kinds will be planted.

＠Kiyohime
How about something normal, like daikon radishes?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
You can boil them, stew them, or put them in miso soup. There is a plethora of recipes using daikon.

＠Kiyohime
Home cooking filled with my love...my ingredients will enter Master's mouth, go down your throat, pass into the stomach,
[k]

＠Kiyohime
...And it will all assimilate with your cells.[sr]In other words, you and I will become one!

I think we should grow cabbage.
[k]

＠Mary
You have a point there. It can be used in just as many recipes as daikon.
[k]

＠Anne
Plus, cabbage is like a savior to sailors.

The fact that it's summer and we're on an island!

[charaFace G 2]
＠Mordred
Which means, there's one obvious thing we have to grow: watermelons!
[k]


？1：I don't get it, but that confidence blows me away!
？2：Oh right, watermelon is grown like a vegetable.
