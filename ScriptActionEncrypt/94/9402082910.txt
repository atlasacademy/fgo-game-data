＠Suzuka Gozen
I guess Valentine's Day isn't really a good day to be all cooped up in your room like a total loser, huh?
[k]

[charaFace A 16]

＠Suzuka Gozen
But this whole atmosphere is like, totes awesome.[sr]Finally we can take a break from all the fighting.

Life's way better with dance and theater and stuff, y'know? Like, isn't it great that oni and tengu are in this together for a change?

[charaFace A 15]

＠Suzuka Gozen

[k]

[charaFace A 17]

＠Suzuka Gozen
...Aw crap... If I'd known that I'd[sr]have been pickier about what I got...

＠Suzuka Gozen
I figured you'd have, like, MOUNDS of chocolate[sr]and not even know what to do with it all...
[k]

？1：Huh?

Totes brings a tear to your eye, right? Back in my hometown, they were doing a product collab, so I just HAD to get some!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Not bad for a pity gift, is it? Classic snack food, and better than all the nothing you've gotten so far!
[k]
