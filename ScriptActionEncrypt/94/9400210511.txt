＠Elisabeth
Ugh...[sr]That hurts... That hurts... That hurts!
[k]

＠Elisabeth
...Stop it![sr]Don't let me know...
[k]

＠Elisabeth
Don't let me know that it hurts this much when my stomach is cut open! Don't force that on me!
[k]

＠Elisabeth
So what if you tell me that other people would share the same pain! What do you expect me to do?
[k]

＠Elisabeth
Why?! Why am I the only one miserable?![sr]No matter what I do, why can't I be saved?!
[k]

＠Elisabeth
If you say you're humans, wouldn't that make me a more lowly beast?!
[k]

＠Elisabeth
Like a lizard, like a lizard, like a lizard... Are you telling me to crawl on the floor and get stepped on and crushed?
[k]

＠Elisabeth
I can't stand it.[sr]I will not be able to stand it!
[k]

＠Elisabeth
So, please let me kill you. Die already. Please, I beg of you, don't hesitate and KILL ME ALREADY!

＠Mephisto
Yes, those were always her real feelings![sr]For me it only sounded like a scream!
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Mephisto
But I am sure it was a good outlet for her. Her...pride? Or should I call it dignity?
[k]

＠Mephisto
It must be the result of the education she received as an aristocrat. The ruling class is not allowed to lament.
[k]

＠Mephisto
“Those who stand over others must shoulder suitable responsibility.” I am sure that idea was etched onto her.
[k]

＠Mephisto
She picked herself up after falling, trying to aim for the top only to fall again, covered in mud. Yet she picked herself up again.
[k]

＠Mephisto
It looks like she keeps repeating the process as her atonement. Hmmm, kind of like a dragon that keeps collecting shining treasure in its dungeon.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mephisto
That's why, don't mind the ugly side of her you've just witnessed. Next time you see her...
[k]

＠Mephisto
...just say, “Your horns are pretty cute,” and everything will be okay!

...Really? If that was her repressed scream, wouldn't that eventually poison her and turn her into a real monste... Whoa! What's going on?

T-T-Trouble, Romani! I don't know why, but Elisabeth all of sudden charged into my workshop!
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
And she started saying, “I just woke up, and somehow I am feeling really refreshed!”
[k]

＠Da Vinci
“That's why I made you some snacks to show my appreciation for you! Come eat them! Eat them with gratitude in your heart!”
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 2]
＠Da Vinci
Oh no, it's melting! Why is the sauce from that plate burning my Mona Lisa?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Help me Romani! I can't deal with her by myself! No... Why is this happening...
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 5]
＠Da Vinci
Did she just roast three golems and turn them into a bunch of cookies?

Okay, there's nothing to worry! Chaldea is as peaceful as ever, [%1]!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Don't worry and keep investigating that apartment. I won't worry about what just happened either and focus on backing you up.
[k]

？1：R-Right.
