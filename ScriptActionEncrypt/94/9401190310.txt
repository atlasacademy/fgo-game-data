...We're coming to a fork.[sr]The path splits into two here.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
One way leads to the Chest, where the Central Command Room used to be. The other to the Thighs, which used to house the dock and heliport.

I suppose that makes this the Hair then.[sr]What sort of facility did this area contain?

It housed the submarine cables. It was also fused together with the pump and the power plant.

It should be safe here, even in SE.RA.PH.[sr]The Sentinels won't come this far.

But the most important area around here is the Chest. It's possible we'll find survivors in the Central Command Room.

And what is wrong with a man finding a woman's chest attractive? Personally, I believe it to be a sign of excellent health and breeding.

I see. I know I'll regret this, but here goes: what do you think of my chest then?

Hahaha, it is not even worth discussing. But worry not, milady, I am sure you still have much to live for. Now, where was I...

You see, [%1]?[sr]These are his true colors.

＠Meltryllis
Fortunately, I'm well aware that even in fairy tales, Prince Charming was always discriminatory in his affections. He's just lucky this isn't the moon, or I'd be happily tearing him limb from limb.

？2：(I'm just going to pretend I didn't hear that.)

[charaFace B 5]
＠Gawain
Speaking of which, you really should be putting more energy into yours, Meltryllis. So far as I can tell, you are not even trying.

Indeed, I am Tristan of Sorrow, the Child of Sadness.[sr]I say... Are you a Master?

...I am amazed to see that there is still a respectable one to be found here.

[charaFace C 2]
＠Tristan
...And yet, it also saddens me. I have encountered as many as seven Servants in my time here.
[k]

＠Tristan
Each and every one of them had been pushed to the brink of madness. It pained me to slay them.
[k]

＠Tristan
And now, the first Master I meet here is joined by a devil woman.
[k]

＠Tristan
...It seems that SE.RA.PH is truly hell on earth.
[k]

＠Tristan
Sir Gawain. Young Master.
[k]

＠Tristan
I must slay this devil woman at once.[sr]Would you be so kind as to move away from her?

Do that, and no harm shall befall you.[sr]I shall focus my fury on her and her alone.

(Furthermore, his bewitched arrows can and will pierce all that he sees without mercy. If we do battle, I cannot guarantee your safety.)

Your willingness to trust in others, no matter who they may be, is exactly what is needed here on SE.RA.PH. Yet it is also a great weakness.
