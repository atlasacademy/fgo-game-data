(Sobs) All I wanted... was a chance to have a role in this story...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
All I wanted was a new Noble Phantasm, a new skill, a new Craft Essence, and a new costume... That's all...

Tamamo-no-Mae. I understand your feelings.

＠Ushiwakamaru
Nevertheless, the role of the dog is mine this time.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
You are older than my lord... so rather than the faithful dog, you're more suited to the role of the mother waiting for him to return[line 3]

＠Dr. Roman
Oh! That's very admirable![sr]So you do obey the rules!

[charaTalk F]

＠Sakata Kintoki
It's not admirable. It's only natural.[sr]I'm a hero to children, you know.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Only drink when you're an adult, and have a designated driver when you do.

＠Sakata Kintoki
The machines that us Riders travel on are all monsters, even if they're not Bear.
