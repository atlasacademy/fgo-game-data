＠A：???
Welcome. It's so good of you all to come. I'm Hirano Ex, one of the Seven Spears of the Imperial Capital.
[k]

＠Hirano Ex
I'm also the manager of Dark Rounds,[sr]the hot new sweets café that's sweeping the galaxy.
[k]

？1：Sweets...?
？2：Can't believe that menace sunk its claws into the capital too...!
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Hirano Ex
This is a wonderful place.
[k]

＠Hirano Ex
I've never seen such perfect blends of Eastern bean pastries and classic Western sweets.
[k]

＠Hirano Ex
It was just begging to expand on a galactic level! Franchises in every solar system!

You really do have a lot of delicious-looking sweets...[sr]I think I may buy some myself...

The Dark Rounds Bean Sponge Cake? Of course. That'll be two dollars, please. However, if you want it to go, I'll have to ask you to wait a little longer.

＠A：Ex (Manager)
Oh, all right. In that case, you may go ahead and have a seat at one of the tables in our dine-in area. Anyway, as I was saying...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠A：Ex (Manager)
...Unfortunately, Manager Ex's joy was short-lived when she realized something terrible.
[k]

？1：Something terrible?
？2：Can I please have one of your Galaxy Chick Sweet Custard Buns?
？！

＠Hirano Ex
I...I just realized... Since I am the manager...I'll never get to eat any of these sweets myself...!
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_3 0.1]

＠Hirano Ex
The only thing I can do now is defeat you,[sr]and make you take over as manager!
[k]

＠Hirano Ex
So, on that note...get ready for a fight. When fine sweets are on the line, you'd better believe Ex is gonna give it to you!
