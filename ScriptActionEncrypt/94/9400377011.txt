＠Mash
She ran beyond the gate so quickly... She's so fast.
[k]

＠Mash
...I'm sorry, Mr. Golden. We're badly damaged as well. We've used too much energy.
[k]

＠Mash
It feels very dangerous to pass through the gate like this...

＠Sakata Kintoki
Fine. We'll come back tomorrow.[sr]Let's eat something while we can.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Even with Kyoto in this state, there's gotta be a place to eat. I recommend some golden mash and golden pastries.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Get some energy stored up. Oni are greedier than any other creature, and there's no telling what they'll do.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
This might end up being a much longer fight than you're expecting.
