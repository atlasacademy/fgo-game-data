Oh... How can this be... To ignore what you're told is a bad move, a lost cause, extreme uselessness!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mephisto
You killed me, the only one who knows the truth! Now the case is cold, dead people tell no tales. It's too late!
[k]

＠Mephisto
But how should I put it? There are a lot of mystery novels where the perpetrator dies in the beginning, right?
[k]

＠Mephisto
You guys, use your heads, and solve this abnormal situation!

...Enemy Servant eliminated.[sr]Was that really the right move?
[k]

？1：Now we have no clues...

＠Mash
Right... Although Mephisto's words are not really trustworthy, if he really was the cause of this abnormality...
[k]

＠Mash
...Then we just destroyed the only lead we had...[sr]We're bad detectives.

Oh, you recovered from that pretty fast. Right, that's not a bad thing.

Don't feel bad, Mash.[sr]Eliminating one or two perpetrators won't be an issue.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
Didn't I say “investigations start from the bottom”? The next crime scene is waiting for us, detective.

Hum... Detective story... So this was a detective story? No, never mind that...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Even if it was self-proclaimed, killing the perpetrator is pretty damaging...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
At least if we'd arrested him, we could've interrogated him about this place, and why it attracts ghosts...

That's right! I'm really sorry! I wanted to be useful and use my scissors as much as possible...

The one here is me, the good Mephisto.[sr]Ah, in other words...
[k]

＠Mephisto
One of me laments this situation, and the other one enjoys it. But now is not the time to question my conscience.
[k]

＠Mephisto
So, if I split my good heart and evil heart apart like this...
[k]

＠Mephisto
I can basically clone myself! Oooohhh, UNBELIEVABLE!

Not in the least! To tell you the truth... I'm truly sorry but if you could allow me to get involved, and tone down the rate of ghost-gathering,
[k]

I could make a horror show, incredibly realistic, about half dead, half living, killing and being killed...

＠Mephisto
I was summoned by someone else, not via Chaldea's summoning system, to this tower of resentment.
[k]

＠Mephisto
By that guy, his name is... That guy... Grand something. That guy is one class above mine.
[k]

＠Mash
!!!
[k]

＠Mephisto
He said to me, “Shouldn't you be on this side?” And he does have a point, so...
[k]

＠Mephisto
After that, I split dramatically.
[k]

＠Mephisto
My evil self disguised itself as a Servant of Justice and infiltrated Chaldea.
[k]

＠Mephisto
I'm sure that's possible because I'm over there.
[k]

＠Mephisto
Because only Servants who were summoned by a Master can find Chaldea.
[k]

＠Mephisto
My evil self used this clever loophole, and started recruiting.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Mephisto
He said: “There's a new place to live. There are rooms for Servants. You don't need a deposit. The first month is free. Move in as fast as possible!”
[k]

＠Mephisto
Ah, I am such a good salesman! I am jealous of myself!
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Mephisto
But it can't be helped. Chaldea's rooms for Servants are too small!
[k]

＠Mephisto
No posters on the wall. No pets in the rooms, except for those that came with horses.
[k]

＠Mephisto
That's why everyone came to this side. Then, when I got the chance...
[k]

＠Mephisto
I escaped from the Grand-something's contract, and happily waited for all you to arrive!
[k]

＠Mephisto
Ah, I knew!
[k]

＠Mephisto
That [%1] would admonish my evil self and believe in my good heart...hehe, to think that you'd believe in me!
