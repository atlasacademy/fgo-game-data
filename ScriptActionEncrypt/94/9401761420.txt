I don't get it. How can you be so destructively off-key when our voices are fundamentally identical?

No doubt the whole reason we ended up looking like demonic monsters rather than beautiful angels is because of that destructive voice of yours.

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Though we were both born from the Anti-Hero Elisabeth, neither of us could ever become her, as both of us gave up on singing.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
But where I continued to carry out her desire to be this land's ruler, you discarded even that.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
That was an act of pure ego, done only to allow you to remain as Csejte's guardian, rather than go on protecting its people as their ruler.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
So it is no wonder an egomaniac like you hears a song like this as something horrid.

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Singing is a festive act, but sloth wallows in silence.[sr]They could not be further apart.

I'm sure it's having such a deleterious effect on you because you're trying to impose laziness on the world.
