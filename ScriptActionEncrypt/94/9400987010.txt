Did you summon me?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
...Just kidding.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
A ninja appearing with the snap of a finger. Nice.[sr]I feel like an elite ninja...

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Eh? You have other business with me?
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
What is it?
[k]

？1：Chocolates...
？2：I hope you'll accept them.

Chocolate... Chocolate...

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Ah! The celebration called Valentine's Day!
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I see. I'd heard rumors about it...but I never expected to be involved in something like this, so I didn't know what to say at first.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Of course I will accept this wonderful gift.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Thank you, my Master...!
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I do not know how to express this feeling of happiness.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Perhaps I can change the name of my Noble Phantasm to “Immortal Happy Valentine” just for today...
[k]

？1：Seriously!?
？2：I thought it was important to you.
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
...No, that is a joke, of course.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
And I heard from the female Servants that a return gift is necessary.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I do feel I need to offer a wonderful item to reflect my gratitude for the great treatment I have been receiving.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Ascension materials... No, not something like that...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
...My apologies. I'll think about it.
[k]

？1：How about the manjyu desserts you always carry?

＠Fuuma Kotarou
My apologies. This manjyu is not appropriate as a return gift.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
This manjyu is called Fuuma Manjyu. The entire Fuuma clan worked together to make an exceptional delicacy.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
A full day's worth of nutrients is packed in, and it's high in protein, vitamins, and calories.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
With Fuuma Manjyu, starvation and malnourishment are a thing of the past.
[k]

？1：Amazing!
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Thank you very much. As part of the development team for this item, I am very proud.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
But, there was one problem...

[fontSize large]It tastes horrible.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
That's a pretty fatal flaw.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
We were all so focused on making it nutritious, nobody thought about its taste.
