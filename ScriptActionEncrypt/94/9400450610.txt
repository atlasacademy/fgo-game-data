＠Dr. Roman
This is like a slum... I should have known that they'd only be provided with the bare minimum.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Most likely they've been brought here from the mainland. With this many, there's really nothing we can do for them.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
We can't prepare a ship to take them to the mainland anytime soon, and we're not equipped as a rescue team to begin with.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
With our limited numbers, the best we can do is eliminate the cause. To rescue all these captured people, we need to make preparations.

If we were to release them from these settlements and the labor camps, the oni would just bring them all back.
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Yes. All we can do now is collect information.[sr]Before any more troublesome oni arrive.

When the environment gets too harsh, sometimes humans give into despair... In the end, they just don't even think about it anymore.

Most of them just sit on the ground and hang their heads. They look like defeated soldiers.

But you would think that there was at least one person that we could talk to...
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Ah! There's one now that's walking with a firm stride.

If that is true, then I cannot conceal the shame that I feel before everyone.

I know that Benkei is already quite powerful...[sr]but he seems a lot more powerful than usual...

[charaTalk A]

＠Dr. Roman
Sumo matches aside, please answer my questions first. Why are you here?
[k]

[charaTalk G]

＠Benkei
A retainer must follow his lord at all times. Of course,[sr]I am here to aid the Master and Lord Yoshitsune.
[k]

＠Benkei
There is another settlement higher up, so I went looking for you there, but couldn't find you.
[k]

＠Benkei
I went elsewhere and searched about for you, and eventually ended up here.
[k]

＠Benkei
I am very glad we could meet up.[sr]Let us march forth and exterminate these oni!

Something still feels off about you, but I can just dispose of you when I am done.

＠Benkei
Sakata Kintoki. I had heard that you are a reckless individual, but it seems like you are a man of refined taste!

＠Benkei
Ho ho! ...I would like to have a sumo match here to deepen our friendship[line 2]

But, unfortunately, it seems others have come who wish to test their strength against yours.

It's like Benkei says, there is an oni patrol approaching! There is no time to hide.
[k]

？1：Let's go face them!

I was once known as Oniwaka, the Young Oni. Sit back and watch as I rampage as hard as any of them!
