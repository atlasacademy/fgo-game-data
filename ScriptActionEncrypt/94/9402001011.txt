Okay, okay, you win.[sr]I guess this is why people invented Tupperware.

I bet there are plenty of Servants at the hot springs who'll help ensure all this food doesn't go to waste.

Guess we'll start with the dishes that spoil[sr]easily, and see where it goes from there...

What I said to Lord Emiya[sr]earlier remains true, Master.

＠General Setsubun
Our objective is to eradicate this tower,[sr]regardless of why it was built.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
As such, we must make our way to[sr]the top floor as soon as possible.

I almost let my guard down for a moment...but I am well aware that I must not let that slow me down.

Yes. Now that we have passed the eightieth floor,[sr]I feel the time is fast approaching...

I can't believe it. You don't know what you're missing. But then again, I guess it WOULD be pretty tough to take regular baths on the open sea.

Still, trust me, baths are the best. They feel great, they make you look great, and if you end up getting down and dirty in one, you're in the perfect place to wash up!

Indeed, staying in hot water for too long can be deadly. I'm well aware. It's dangerous. One must be vigilant for signs of changes in blood pressure, dehydration, and no doubt other symptoms as well.
