Chocolate is as unfamiliar to him as Chaldea itself.[sr]In his eyes, they're both great unknowns.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Meat, dirt... They're different. They're both connected to his past in some way[line 2]though whether or not he remembers is another matter.
[k]

＠Enkidu
But no, not chocolate.
[k]

＠Enkidu
The cacao, the sugar... That sweet aroma...[sr]None of these bring any old memories to his mind.
[k]

＠Enkidu
And perhaps he finds that comforting.
[k]

＠Enkidu
That's probably his way of trying to blend in. The ride,[sr]I imagine, was his way of showing gratitude to you.
