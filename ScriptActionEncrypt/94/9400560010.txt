？！

＠Mash
Ah, [charaFace A 6]no, Senpai.[sr]It's [charaFace A 12]nothing. Nothing, but...
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
How to put it... I'm feeling uneasy in a way I have not experienced before.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Now that I think about it, we've really had a lot of unexpected Rayshifts so far.
[k]

＠Mash
But what is about to happen is incomparable.[sr]It looks like a wonderous, amazing experience...
[k]

＠Mash
...Perhaps not so much a shift as it will be a drift?

Please don't worry about it, Senpai.

？1：Mash, are you sick? Let me feel your forehead.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mash
...O-Oh! S-Senpai! What are you...!?[sr]I'm, I'm fine. My temperature is normal!
[k]

＠Mash
I'm the same as usual...[sr]No, I'm better than usual!
[k]

？2：When you say that, all I can do is worry...

[line 3]A bad premonition, huh?[sr]No need for concern, Master.

＠Scáthach
This time, I will be accompanying you, too. We should assume one or two unexpected events will occur.

Meat tastes better when there's some tendon in it. Challenges are more fun when they're difficult.
