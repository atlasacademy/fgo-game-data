W-What an appalling fortress. You seem to have quite a variety of security systems built into the place.

Hey. Lemme ask you something.[sr]Do you know why I'm so hung up on strong defenses?

It's because I've gotta protect you, at all costs.

＠Mordred
The island's pretty developed now, but we can't let our guard down. This place is huge. There may be enemies here that we don't know about yet.
[k]

＠Mordred
And in war, if you lose your leader, you're more or less done for. You can't ever recover from that.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Mordred
That's why, see? How do I put this...?
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

Unlike me, you're kind of a weakling.[sr]And if you got killed, it would be over for all of us.

Yes...indeed! I agree, Mordred![sr]Keeping Master alive should be our top priority.
[k]

＠Mash
I feel the same way as you do. Until we can leave this island, we don't know what might happen. We mustn't lower our guard until the very end.

Okay, to the beach! Let's go to the beach! If you get hot, just ride the waves! That should solve everything!

Don't sweat the small stuff! All you've gotta do is put your faith in me and the waves!
