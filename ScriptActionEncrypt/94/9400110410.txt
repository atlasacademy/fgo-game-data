...Is Fergus okay, you think?

＠Mash
I can't detect his magical energy, maybe because of the[sr]fire. His temporary contract with Senpai appears to be broken.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Scáthach
A town about to burn to the ground, huh? This place[sr]must have left strong impressions of death on you.
[k]

＠Scáthach
That's why there are so many remnants here[sr]that were abandoned even by death.
[k]

＠???
Exactly what you just said...

This place will be overflowing with those remnants,[sr]and much sorrow and pain as well.

He brought glory to the Knights of Fianna along with[sr]the god-slaying hero, Fionn mac Cumhaill. Then...

That goes for more than just Diarmuid.[sr]The greater the admiration for a hero...

No, this is where you laugh, Mash. Celtic men leave[sr]behind nothing but tears and rage for their women.

It's true that I regret my end.[sr]That's why [charaFace F 0]my lance can be of aid to you.

Even if this is a temporary contract,[sr]a Master is no different than a liege lord.

...What a pleasant response...[sr]There are no lies in your heart, are there?

Yes, yes. I figured you'd get along. Diarmuid prefers[sr]Masters who are exactly what they seem to be.

I've raised so many warriors that I think[sr]I've got a good eye for when people will get along.

？1：You're like a goddess of relationships.

Well, I'm nothing of the sort, but...[sr]I don't mind being told that.

[charaFace D 1]

Heh. That's an interesting idea, [%1].[sr]Goddess of Relationships... I might think about that...

Mash's phrasing isn't too bad, though.[sr]Lady. That sounds elegant. I like it.

Well, the fact is, in human years I'm over 2000 years old.[sr]It doesn't bother me that much, and I haven't had the chance anyway.
