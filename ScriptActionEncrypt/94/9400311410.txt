Fou.

That Rider, I knew he had such a crazy attitude, but... who knew it'd be this bad?!

We're enemies just because? What was he on about!? He just pisses me off!

＠Dr. Roman
Hmm? Hold on a second. I'm getting a magical energy signature approaching you. Its strength indicates it's a Servant.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's different from any remaining Assassin fragments, and also from Rider and Berserker who retreated earlier.

That means...the figures don't add up, right?

＠El-Melloi
Yeah. There are only seven Heroic Spirits that the Fuyuki Holy Grail can call forth. Meaning it's an irregular like us. It's him.

The Holy Grail War is nearing its end, and before its conclusion, I must have that homunculus destroyed.

＠El-Melloi
So you're after the vessel of the Holy Grail after all. It seems like our goals are similar, but our methodology is different.
[k]

？1：The vessel of the Holy Grail?

？！

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
Yes. She's pretending to be Saber's Master, but...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
She is serving a different purpose. She collects the souls of fallen Heroic Spirits... A Lesser Grail, the key that opens the Greater Grail.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Like giving an autonomous personality to ceremonial equipment.

You're quite knowledgeable. But I don't really like you saying I'm pretending to be a Master. Am I not a proper Master? Is that what you want to say?

There's no reason to hide anything this late in the game, homunculus.

Irisviel is being used as bait. I know the true Master is hiding in the shadows.
