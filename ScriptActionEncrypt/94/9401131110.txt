Is there...a huge amount of magical energy pouring out of Monkey's castle?

There were a few things I wanted to look into, so I returned to Chaldea to analyze them with Da Vinci.

Thanks for that to-be-expected reaction.[sr]Of course, I am a genius, after all.

＠Da Vinci
So what is there, to be blunt,[sr]is the corpse of a Demon God Pillar.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Specifically, the carcass of the Demon God Pillar that died in that Singularity somehow ended up there, and somehow carved that space out of time itself.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Da Vinci
...Or maybe it fled while it was near death, and ultimately made it there.

Whichever the case, we haven't been able to determine why it meddled with space-time there.

We do know that it is somewhat different than the ones we encountered before, so please be careful, Senpai!

And within this space, the Great Gold Demon Taikou is going to grant the blessing of eternity to mortals everywhere, and so save them all!

[charaFace G 6]

＠Nobukatsu
Not acknowledging Big Sister because you were a woman!? Unforgivable! That's why I did all of this!
[k]

＠Nobukatsu
And as a result, you purged them all, and they became...that!
[k]

＠Nobukatsu
You're brilliant! You were the obvious successor of the Oda clan! There is no way I could have fulfilled that role!

[charaFace G 2]

There will be no need to think of the future![sr]You just have to retain your current happiness!

＠Nobukatsu
If you don't eliminate neighboring states, your own state will be destroyed... We're forced to fight needless battles just for the sake of territory!

There's no need to return to that crazy era anymore!
