Senpai, there's a door. We didn't see one before when we were here.
[k]

＠Mash
An emergency exit... It appears to be a door leading to the roof. Come to think of it...

Fou found a strange key, right? I see. So finally we get to meet the mastermind behind all this.

...I knew it. Mephisto only became known as such after the construction of this apartment building.
[k]

＠Mash
Although Mephisto brought the Servants here,[sr]he had nothing to do with their so-called mutations.
[k]

＠Mash
So[line 3]
[k]

？1：...Oh. Then that black-shrouded guy should be there.
？2：Well, why don't we go interrupt his so-called work?

？！

Let's use the key.[sr]Who knows what's going to come out of here.

The sky feels close[line 3] You wouldn't be able to tell just from looking at the building.

It's well constructed. It reminds me of the roof on the Fujou Building.
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
...It'll be dawn soon. Hey, you in black over there. Did your so-called “work” end?

As if it would end. My grudge shall never fade away, ever.
[k]

＠???
I suppose this tower will disappear.[sr]It will return to nothingness by your hands.
[k]

＠???
But my work is not done yet. The island of despair. The tower of incarceration. The castle of treasures.
[k]

＠???
Until I remember it all, I shall never give up.

Master, prepare for battle![sr]I have confirmed the presence of an enemy Servant.

＠Mash
That is a Heroic Spirit who should not exist in this world!

[line 3]Keh.[sr]Hahahahahahahahahaha!

＠???
A Heroic Spirit who should not exist in this world, you say! You should have your tongue burned out for such lies, Demi-Servant!
[k]

＠???
Eventually you will know Heroic Spirits and spirits of the dead are the same thing. We are all curses fallen into the shadow of this world.

No, we simply did not disappear. Curses don't disappear.
[k]

＠???
This is a system of curses that is already complete. This is the debt to humanity that the King of Mages has thrust upon me.
[k]

＠???
As long as others exist, there will be both resentment and killing. The hatred of those sacrificed are my nourishment.
[k]

＠???
This is eternal. A miserable hell that goes on forever.
[k]

＠???
The pious would likely worship me as a god of the greatest depths[line 3] An indestructible phenomenon immune to death.

...It has far more magical energy than last time, Master! It really does...seem to increase its resentment every time you defeat it.
[k]

＠Mash
If it keeps increasing at this rate[line 3][sr]we will not be able to kill that monster[line 3]

Even if something exists for millions of years, it's only the false impression of eternal youth that humans project on it.

＠Ryougi Shiki
But all things possess the seed of destruction. There is nothing in the universe that is immutable for eternity.

Get lost, vengeful demon.[sr]No matter how long or great a life is[line 3]
