Seriously, cut that out! What kind of nonsense is a move I can't see even after I already saw through your movement!? You think people can just swing their swords around like chopsticks or something!?

Strength is not from the body alone, but from a state of perfect zen, and absolute purity. That was the ultimate strike, one I spent my entire career as a swordsman perfecting.

And yet, you were able to parry it somehow. I didn't pay much attention to this twaddle about “the greatest swordsman under heaven,” since it sounded like you made it up...
