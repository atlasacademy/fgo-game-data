＠Shakespeare
Your idea is noble but tainted by evil thoughts.[sr]I believe that's why you lost.
[k]

＠Emiya
I don't remember having those evil thoughts[line 2]
[k]

？1：What do you mean?
？！

＠Shakespeare
If Lord Emiya feels like it, he can effortlessly make a chocolate.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
In the event that Master does not receive chocolate from anyone... Since Master would look bad if that happened...
[k]

＠Shakespeare
He was going to say “You might not want one from[sr]your guardian, but here” and then give you a chocolate.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Shakespeare
That was the kind of beautiful ending he was going for.
[k]

＠Emiya
The feeling of not receiving anything,[sr]I... I understand that feeling all too well...
[k]

＠Emiya
I made this chocolate using leftover ingredients, but I thought it would be better than nothing...
[k]

？1：Mom's chocolate...

[charaFace A 0]
＠Shakespeare
It's the last insurance on Valentine's Day.[sr]Well, in Master's case, there is Ms. K.
[k]

？2：Yay! Chocolate!

[charaFace B 3]
＠Emiya
I see, it makes me happy that you like it...[sr]But I guess that's just me being nosy...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Shakespeare
...By the way, Lord Emiya.[sr]Do you know that Red Saber over there?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Emiya
Red Saber?[sr]I don't remember calling her here[line 2]
