＠B：Avenger
...Heh, heh.

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
Amazing. I see. You've learned how I fight...[sr]Your time as my temporary Master was well-spent.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
Hahaha! This feels good![sr]Indeed! I wanted to taste this once!
[k]

＠B：Avenger
To be like the one person who gave me guidance...[sr]The noble Abbé Faria!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
I... I can be a tiny light of hope...
[k]

＠B：Avenger
To an innocent person[line 3][sr]who fell into a terrible trap[line 3]
[k]

？1：Edmond Dantès...

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
...So you would call me that...too?
[k]

？2：Avenger!

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
Haha! That's right![sr]You understand me, Master!
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
I shall admit it! You have done me a favor by killing me! You have guided me to victory[line 3]
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
You don't understand?[sr]...Yes, I'm sure.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
I knew naught of victory.[sr]Even as I found my place in history as an Avenger...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
Because Edmond was saved at the end...
[k]

＠B：Avenger
I, the one who failed to taste victory and achieve his revenge, continued to exist.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
But...you, [%1]. I guided you to victory, and you overcame the obstacles and escaped the prison tower.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
What an ending...[sr]...filled with hope.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
I was without victory, and you allowed me to guide you, and earn that victory.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
You're so generous[line 3]Haha, [%1]!
[k]

＠B：Avenger
“We” have won! Not even the King of Mages is all-powerful!
[k]

？1：So this was Solomon's...

？！


[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
Fool. You may speak of the King of Mages, but do not use his True Name carelessly.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
That name has become a curse. Just saying it aloud is enough to place that curse on you.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
That is how you came to be in this hell.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
You stared into his eyes in London, did you not?[sr]That was enough for him.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
It's called the Evil Eye.[sr]You were given a fatal poison then.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
He didn't let you go.[sr]He decided that you were already finished.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠B：Avenger
But[line 3]Haha! Hahaha![sr]This was the result! Too bad, King of Mages!
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Your single whim, your single cunning trap has met its end here!
[k]

＠B：Avenger
That's what you get for choosing me, you fool!
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Walk forth! Keep struggling! You have been released...from this prison of the soul!
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Someday you shall save the world!
[k]

？1：Will you disappear forever?

？！

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
...You would wish to meet me, an Avenger, once more?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
Hahaha! HAHAHAHA![sr]Then there is but one thing I can say!
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠B：Avenger
“Attendre et espérer.” Wait and hope!
