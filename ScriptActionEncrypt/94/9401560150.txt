＠Edison
Hm. I believe I recall that in newspapers she is said to have been the greatest lumberjack in all of America.
[k]

＠Edison
A single blow of her axe created the Mississippi River, and a blow from her fist could dig an oil well that would reach clear through to China!
[k]

＠Edison
She could drain all five Great Lakes dry in a single gulp. A swing of her pickaxe could shatter the entire Rocky Mountain range!
[k]

＠Edison
Even the Great Plains of the Midwest are said to be what remains of Bunyan cutting down a forest!
[k]

＠Edison
In a way, she's a great being who created the United States by hand! That's who Paul Bunyan is.

Let's set those questions aside for now![sr]She is, after all, standing before us!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Edison
The question is: who summoned Miss Bunyan? Considering that they summoned a Servant, they must also be in possession of a Holy Grail!
[k]

＠Edison
And that tells us that the person who summoned her must be the person who created this Singularity.
