＠Mash
Again!
[k]

？1：We were really trying not to let her escape this time too, but...
？2：We just can't seem to make her stop!

？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
Yes, Master.[sr]She retreats with astonishing agility.

＠Sakata Kintoki
Whenever I see her arm, I'm reminded against my will.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
When Tsuna's sword Higekiri chopped off her arm, she still escaped before he could deal the finishing blow.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
These aren't just flukes.[sr]It must be some kind of ability.
[k]

[charaTalk A]

＠Mash
Maybe she has the “Disengage” skill.[sr]That would be very bothersome.
[k]

＠Mash
By the way, Mr. Golden, what you just said makes me wonder something. Did you know her while you were alive too?
[k]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Only her battle habits. We fought quite a few times.
[k]

？1：Did you know the captured oni... Shuten-Douji, too?
？！

[charaFace B 4]

＠Sakata Kintoki
...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Aaah, well, yeah.[sr]...She was the same as Ibaraki, I guess. Yeah.
[k]

[charaTalk A]

＠Mash
Were the two of them friends?[sr]Or, were they more like boss and subordinate?
[k]

[charaTalk B]



＠Sakata Kintoki
Ibaraki was the boss of all the oni on Mt. Ooe. Shuten also apparently lived there, as a freeloader[line 3]
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
But Ibaraki treated her as her superior, saying Shuten had something she lacked.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
In terms of ranking within the oni clan, they were equals. But that was based solely on Ibaraki's decree...which caused the kinds of problems you'd expect.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Sakata Kintoki
But I do get where Ibaraki was coming from. That Shuten... She was, I guess you can say, a coward in a lot of ways.
[k]


＠Sakata Kintoki
And she was wicked to the core. But she was honestly good to those she'd formed a kind of bond with.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I thought she was a spirit of caprice and mischief in the form of an oni, but she's also chivalrous, dutiful, and humane.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Yeah, she was a natural-born leader, that Shuten-Douji. Though she caused plenty of trouble for her subordinates.
[k]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
I see, I see.
[k]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 4]

＠Sakata Kintoki
And just what the hell are you smiling about, huh?
[k]

[charaTalk A]

＠Mash
I beg your pardon. You just seemed oddly gentle while you were saying all that.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
But that boss oni is now being held prisoner by Ibaraki-Douji.
[k]



＠Mash
She seemed to be completely out cold too.[sr]I wonder what happened...
[k]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
...Who knows? Maybe Ibaraki finally ran out of patience with her.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Oni will always be demonic.[sr]And I'll hunt them down. That's all there is to it.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I'm heading out. If you all want to rest, then go on and rest already.
