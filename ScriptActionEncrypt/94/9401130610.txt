What did you say!? Are you calling the United Satsuma Corporation's products inferior!? This volume, at these prices!?

I am the great Saigou Edimori, king of the United Satsuma Corporation! How dare you speak to me so disrespectfully!?

Well, I'm only stating the truth. Choushu Industries' products are far superior in terms of specifications!

Katsura Tesla, CEO, guarantees it!

I would appreciate it if you wouldn't lump us together with DC Satsuma's draconian employment conditions. Don't you think a 23-hour workday is absolutely barbaric?

Please, both of you... Now is the time to cooperate in order to reach our mutual goal.

United Satsuma's production skills and Choushu Industries' mysterious engineering... With their combined power, nothing can stand in our way!

That's right! The ultimate union of technology: the SatChou Alliance!

The best part is our production pace! We can make one every five minutes without so much as a drop of glue!

At my factory, these are mass-produced round the clock with our 23-hour workdays! It all boils down to numbers when it comes to battle, people of Japan!
