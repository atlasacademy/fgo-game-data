He has a different aura than the other Servants in this Holy Grail War.

Yes, and he feels familiar.[sr]He's more similar to us, at Chaldea.

[charaFace G 1]
＠Waver
Huh? H-How can you tell?
[k]

＠Iskandar
By looking at the traces left here. Neither side was using the terrain, or trying to avoid damage to the area when they fought.
[k]

＠Iskandar
This wasn't a battle between an attacker and defender. Someone tried to run, and someone tried to stop them.
[k]

＠Iskandar
So neither the one who fled when we arrived, nor these people, are our enemy. They must be someone else.
