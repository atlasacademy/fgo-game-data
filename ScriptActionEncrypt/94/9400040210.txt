Th-th-thank you, Marie...[sr]Okay... Aaah.

＠Marie
Delicious, aren't they? They're so plump and chewy, and that sweet, sugary taste...
[k]

＠Marie
And they're so cute, like snowballs.[sr]I'd love to learn how to make them.
[k]

＠Marie
Here, you have some, too.[sr]Aren't sweet dumplings lovely, Sanson?

Y-Yes... I accept this gratefully, my Queen.[sr]But is this really okay?
[k]

＠Sanson
It said “Take what you like,” but for us to take all three tons of it...
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Marie
My dear Sanson, you need to take what you can, when it's offered to you.
[k]

＠Marie
Your modesty is commendable, but it's not good to be too modest.
[k]

＠Marie
What happened to the bold Sanson who readied the guillotine?
[k]

＠Sanson
No... My queen, I didn't actually like the guillotine.[sr]Quite the opposite...

You complain too much, executioner.[sr]Her Majesty said we're taking them.
[k]

＠d'Eon
So we shall help her do it. That's all there is to it.[sr]Fortunately, we have access to Marie's glass carriage.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Carrying a ton or two of snacks is easy.[sr]We should've taken more.

Wait, you're eating more?![sr]That's too much!
[k]

＠Sanson
As a man of medicine, I must advise against[sr]consuming any more calories. You'll get fat...
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Marie
Really, you don't have to worry, Sanson.[sr]Everything I eat goes right to my breasts.
[k]

＠Marie
The more I eat, the bustier I get.[sr]So there's no way I'll get fat.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Sanson
Wh-what...did you...say?![sr]I-is that true, Marie?!

That's medically impossible![sr]But if it is true, I...I!
