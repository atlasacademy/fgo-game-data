When a spoiled child is demanding, it means they're testing your trust. And they're doing that because they're scared.

Look at these Mona Lisas here that just got finished!

What I hate isn't the skill, it's the passion!

Skill-wise, it's still just an inferior copy, but the passion is real. But she's not trying to imitate me!

Instead of putting in the passion to imitate me,[sr]she's starting to put it towards surpassing me!
