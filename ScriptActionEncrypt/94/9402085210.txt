＠A：Mecha Eli-chan
There you are, pilot candidate.[sr]It's me. Magus Aegis Elisabeth Channel.
[k]

＠A：Mecha Eli-chan
Once again you have nothing to do today? Pathetic.[sr]Don't you have even an ounce of ambition?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠A：Mecha Eli-chan
Well, I suppose it's better than having your head in the clouds because it's Valentine's Day.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠A：Mecha Eli-chan
And just for you, I have an important suggestion.[sr]Head to Chaldea's underground hangar. Immediately.
[k]

＠A：Mecha Eli-chan
I'll give you three minutes.[sr]My reactor core doesn't last longer than that.
[k]

？1：Three minutes is too quick!
？2：What happens if I don't make it?

？！

[charaFace A 10]

＠A：Mecha Eli-chan
Haha...you've got some nerve asking stupid questions like that, [%1]. You're awakening my sadistic feelings.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠A：Mecha Eli-chan
And to answer your question, for every minute you're late, you get one Mecha Eli Punch. Or would you prefer to receive a Death Cutter?
[k]

？1：That's just an execution!

？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠A：Mecha Eli-chan
Yes. That's why you shouldn't waste even a second.[sr]I suggest you not trigger my reactor core any more than is necessary.

That was fast! You usually take your sweet time,[sr]but of all the days, why are you on time today!?
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
And you sure look casual.[sr]You're not even breaking a sweat!
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
This irritable feeling is new to me...an impulse I cannot analyze! I don't know what it is, but I'm starting to feel an illogical sense of discontent!
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Argh, Mecha Eli Punch (Ignore Invincible)![se bac8][shake 0.07 1 3 0.5][seStop bac8 0.2][sr]Mecha Eli Punch (Ignore Invincible)![se bac8][shake 0.07 3 1 0.5][seStop bac8 0.2]

？1：Why am I getting scolded for being on time?
？2：Don't tell me you actually wanted some more time...

？！

[charaFace B 3]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Y-yes, indeed. Why am I so angry...?
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Normally, you're never on time, so I should be overjoyed to know you followed the schedule...maybe it's a bug.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Or...perhaps I've completely surpassed my anger limit, and that's why I want to punch everything in sight?
[k]

？1：(I think that's just a bug...)

[charaFace B 5]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
[%1].[sr]Did you just say something?
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
I am the iron demoness Mecha Eli-chan, the guardian of Castle Csejte, and the most beautiful hunk of iron ever.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Don't you know what happens to those who even consider the notion that I might be buggy, or too retro-looking, or as flat as a board?
[k]

[charaFace B 10]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
No, no explanation is needed, correct, [%1]? After all, you are a smart minion of mine.
[k]

？2：So what do you want?

[charaFace B 0]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Oh that's right.[sr]I did not call you up to discuss my Conscience Circuit.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 6]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
The reason I have called you to this sacred area, considered a second homeland by any mech[line 2]which is to say, this hangar...
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
...is to bestow the greatest honor possible upon you.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Take this. This is a gift that proves you as my companion.

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Obviously. I do not consume carbohydrates,[sr]sugars, or calcium. I am iron, after all.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
But that aside, I do know what kind of day today is.[sr]I also acknowledge Halloween, after all.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Ah-ahem. And so, you must kneel to accept this.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
This is an iron bond that connects you and me.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
This is a minion's crown, enabling your voice[sr]commands to reach my AI anytime, anywhere.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
That's right...this is an important item to a main character! And today is its ceremonial ritual!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Hm? What's wrong, [%1]? This makes us one step closer to being one, in body and soul!
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Or perhaps, you just wanted a simple walkie talkie?
[k]

？1：No. I. Am. Happy.
？2：It. Was. Too. Surprising.

？！

[charaFace B 6]

[effect bit_talk_telop_tokusatsu]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Hm. Of course. That's because this is an item from the Special Effects movie that I respect and love most of all.
[k]

[effectStop bit_talk_telop_tokusatsu]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
This is the very best transmitter that will never get old.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
The latest head-mounted display shows a manual of my favorite tactics, my desired attacks, the support items that I want, and phrases to motivate me.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Be sure to read it carefully and adhere[sr]to the guidelines it lays out.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Hm? Why did I make this, you ask?[sr]Why, out of the goodness of my heart, of course.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
There was always something lacking in you,[sr]so I'm taking this opportunity to correct it.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Wonderful, isn't it? My own ingenuity surprises and frightens even me. I did not know Elisabeth Báthory was a genius.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
...Anyway.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
...
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
...
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
...What are you doing? I'm going to spew[sr]fire if you take your sweet time like that.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Hurry up and put it on.[sr]That's what you do in this situation.
[k]

？1：Ungh... (I'm embarrassed, but I have no choice...)
？2：Okay! (This actually looks cool!)

Great...! Oh my, my pilot is TOO cool!
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Oh. Um...nothing. That was a bug.[sr]Don't think too much about it.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
[%1].[sr]Or rather, Master.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
As my pilot candidate,[sr]I wish for you to continue growing.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
I may be the executor of justice, but I am still a weapon. Should the controller have a weak heart, the weapon becomes useless or dangerous.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
This communicator can also be used to force me to shut down. It's like a Command Spell exclusively for me.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Well, its success rate is twelve percent.[sr]But it's better than zero.
[k]

？1：I guess technically twelve is better than nothing!

[charaFace B 6]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Yes. But it will still help me stay under control.[sr]After all, it's your fault that I gained a Conscience Circuit.
[k]

？2：I don't see myself using that function, so it's fine.

[charaFace B 10]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
You're right.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
As long as you're within my sight wearing that communicator, I won't be going berserk.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 0]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Either way, that is my gift to you. I took my utmost trust and shaped it into something tangible.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
If you're disappointed that it wasn't food, then go to the cafeteria. Go eat some chocolates there.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
All that I have to give you is neither fancy nor amusing.
[k]

？1：I think it's plenty amusing...

？！

？1：But...thank you. I'll cherish it.

？！

[charaFace B 6]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
...I see. Your words have calmed my reactor core.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
Then let's test it out. Try saying a command.[sr]Just this once, I won't get mad no matter what it is.
[k]

？1：Okay, if you say so...
