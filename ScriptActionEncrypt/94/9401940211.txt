That beautiful piece...was a collaboration[sr]between me and Toto-sama.

I believe it was the first time I was[sr]tasked with rendering the main subject.

[charaFace A 13]

I painted the woman, and Toto-sama painted[sr]the background flowers, like the crape myrtle.

Since then, I've painted many works under Toto-sama's name...

＠Suzuka Gozen
...That's not the right way to think of it. Ukiyo-e paintings are mostly made as collabs by multiple people in the first place.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
First, you have the painter who designs and renders the original image. Then there's the carver who cuts the wooden blocks faithfully to the original design.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Then there's the printer, who precisely transfers multiple layers of color to paper.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
And then there's the publisher, who suggests and manages each project, advertises new prints to customers, and handles distribution.
[k]

[charaFace B 13]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Put them all together, and you've got yourself a team! It's totally different than Western painters!

Write it to “Adrian”![sr]Wait, no, “Alien”? No, that's still not right...

[charaFace C 2]

Um...anyway! Would you mind adding your[sr]cool-sounding pen name to the painting?

“Seieidou” and “Kitsurudou”?

What the...? They're both publishers[sr]that handle works from the Utagawa school.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Oei
But that's strange.[sr]I don't think we sell our work to either of them...
[k]

＠Oei
And as for this print here, I remember I personally asked the printer to produce a smaller quantity.
[k]

＠Oei
I got so heated up on this piece, and the picture turned out to be so intricate, the printing blocks broke easily.
[k]

＠Oei
It's a failed piece.[sr]You could say I got a little carried away.
[k]

＠Oei
So when I was shown that piece,[sr]I was surprised...and couldn't control myself.
