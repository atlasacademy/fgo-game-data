Let me see... Oh yes, these blueprints are perfect.

If you make it according to these specifications, the projectile should absolutely hit our target at the speed and trajectory we calculated.

Looks that way. But we only have one shot. We can't let her find out what we're up to beforehand, and we can't afford to fail either.
[k]

＠Helena
No matter how insistent Medb may be about taking a shower at the same time each day, if she knows we're planning to assassinate her there, she won't be so predictable.

We need to consider this a onetime opportunity.

So I'd like you to handle collecting the materials and assembling the catapult.

I stay here, at least in part, because I like it.[sr]I helped you with your plan because it benefited me.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Enkidu
At any rate, you all should go ahead with your plan.[sr]I'll be waiting to see how it turns out.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Enkidu
Don't worry. I'm not sure if it's just because the guards are afraid of me or not, but they've left me with plenty of books to read.

I imagine your plan will be finished by the time I've gotten through them all.

＠Professor M
True, he...or she...has already helped us more than enough.
[k]

＠Professor M
I also thoroughly appreciate the value of time spent reading, so I believe it is fair to say that the next part is our problem to solve.
[k]

＠Professor M
One task yet remains before we can put out plan into action. That said, we are still prisoners.
[k]

＠Professor M
As such, I believe it goes without saying that if we are to create this...cheese-apult...
[k]

＠Professor M
...we will still need a certain someone's help.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Professor M
Incidentally, I am aware the picture this paints is one of a sad fiftyish gentleman talking to a doll.
[k]

＠Professor M
So I hope it also goes without saying that this picture is one of happenstance, not intent.

？！

[charaFace F 1]

＠Mash
Right. I'm sure the others will tell us everything you need to get.
[k]

＠Mash
And just like before, you can use the visiting room system to sneak them the materials.
[k]

[charaFace F 12]

＠Mash
That should let them use their blueprints to build their cat[line 2]uh, cheese-apult.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Mash
This may not be part of a race, but it will still directly affect everyone's escape plan.
[k]

＠Mash
I'll help you out too, so let's both do our best, Senpai!
