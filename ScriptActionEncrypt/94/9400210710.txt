Inside that armor is probably a hollow shell like the ghosts outside, or a bony skeleton!

Unlike my armor, my patience is wearing thin. Especially when it comes to humiliation.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
You ruffians have witnessed a king's face. Since it has come to that, a fight cannot be avoided.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
I shall forgive your disrespect if you can survive and prove your bravery to me. If you can't, your soul will be mine.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
I am the King of Storms, the Wild Hunt itself! All those who witness my face shall become my servant.
[k]

＠Lancer Alter
My limbs, my offerings... Cry as you gather under me. Be as crimson as velvet, fit to decorate my hooves.

This tower here is my castle. Here I go, human! Resist your fate with all of your might!
