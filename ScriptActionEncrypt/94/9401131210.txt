Hey, don't say that. If there's anything to blame, it's the era we lived in. It's nobody's fault. It was just the times!

Listen, Chacha. I know Monkey very well. He was naive yet calculating, emotional yet unequivocal, and truly coldhearted.

A man who was unquestionably two-faced, and yet he shone with glory. He was a man like the sun itself.

It was only natural for him to succeed me as ruler.

That thing really is the carcass of a Demon God Pillar.

＠Nobunaga
During the battle with Solomon, it must have developed some self-awareness.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Nobunaga
What happens when a living thing becomes aware of itself? Naturally, it begins to fear its eventual demise.
[k]

＠Nobunaga
While the other Demon God Pillars stayed on the battlefield following orders, this one fled its post... Because it wanted to live.
[k]

＠Nobunaga
However, weak as it was, it was unable to stave off death. And so it drew it last breath[line 2]here. Now, only its vindictive desires remain.

Wait, YOU figured this all out? I mean, you're right... That's basically the residual thought patterns of a Demon God Pillar that took shape.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It may just be a corpse that drifted here, but it's still a Demon God Pillar. Even that shell is a powerful magical tool.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The Demon God Pillar resonated with the powerful desire not to die, then fused with that very desire and materialized as something similar to a Grail.

It's like a nasty parasite. It can't maintain its existence without using the Spirit Origin of a Heroic Spirit as a catalyst.
