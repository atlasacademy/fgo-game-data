What? Chocolates, you say...?

[charaFace A 2]
＠Gilgamesh
You fool! This is no emergency! How dare you so casually call upon me, mongrel!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Gilgamesh
Besides, confections from commoners like you could never please my refined palate!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I am an exquisite king well-versed in the finer luxuries in life. Such paltry offerings are better tossed to the mewling brats!
[k]

？1：You...haven't even tried them yet...
？2：But it's gourmet...

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gilgamesh
Ha! So you let it slip, [%1]. Food is eighty percent presentation, and twenty percent taste, fool!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I don't need to taste it to know, seeing this plain wrapping! Now, a shimmering golden wrapper with confections dipped in edible gold, on the other hand...
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Only the most glimmering, blindingly bright confections are fit for my royal tongue!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Gilgamesh
...Hmm, I suppose edible gold should be taken in moderation, though. If I were to eat too much, I may not be able to avoid becoming the next Midas.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Gilgamesh
Regardless! I have no interest in your pitiful confection! Fortunately for you, I am not so cruel as to ignore offerings from my subjects.
[k]

[se ad7]

？1：Huh.
？2：He took it.

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gilgamesh
Hmph. I take it only as a formality.[sr]In a few moments, I will have forgotten it entirely.

Making an offering is laudable. Even so, you are still a mongrel. Inferior. Pathetic. Offering a confection to a king? You may as well offer fruit to the heavens!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Almost any paltry material offering would insult a king. Ah, well. I shall let you off the hook this once. You might say you've earned a participation award...
[k]

[se ade11]

＠Gilgamesh
Let's see...hmmm... You had the to nerve to make it yourself. That, at least, is acceptable.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Oh. Ohhh... You made it to look like the door to my treasure vault.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Hahahahaha! You dare say that ingredients may be inferior, but the sentiment is first class, you fool!? Insolent! Have the decency to have a sense of shame!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
But the main question is its taste. Sincerity does not fill the belly. I have no interest in this tripe, but I'll take a bite.

＠Gilgamesh
...It's surprisingly sweet...

Hmmm, The Lion and the Mouse, Puss and Boots... I'm sure there were folktales of that sort in Sumer as well.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If you ask me, this kind of thing should be delivered in person, but that's that. That is the king's way.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Anyway, I'll take my leave. As it's a gift, you should wear it so that he can see it.
