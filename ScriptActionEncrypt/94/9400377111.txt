She got away again...

But I could tell we were hitting her.[sr]We're wearing her down, I think.
[k]

＠Mash
Let's just stay calm and be careful.
[k]

？1：It's such a help that you're always calm.

[charaFace A 3]

＠Mash
I-Is it? I'm glad...
[k]

？2：We're getting tired, though...

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Yes. We need to recover our strength as well.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
Let's retreat a little and make camp.[sr]That should let us talk to the Doctor as well.

Hmm... Got it. Thanks for the report.[sr]Just keep it up and don't let your guard down.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Sorry. There's just so much static near the gate that I can't analyze anything or communicate with you.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
By the way... [%1].

＠Dr. Roman
How's Mash looking?[sr]Is she, um, drunk? (Psst psst)
[k]

？1：She's normal during battle.

＠Dr. Roman
Is she? But...
[k]

？2：(Point to your side without saying a word)

Dinner's ready, Senpai! We're having what Mr. Golden requested, golden rice balls.
[k]


＠Mash
Since we're on the battlefield, it's curry-flavored! Everyone loves curry! But [charaFace A 0]unfortunately your fingers get a little sticky.
[k]


[charaFace A 16]

There's only one way to deal with this.[sr]Open wide, Senpai!

[communicationCharaFace 3]

＠Dr. Roman
If she's normal during combat, and near that gate,
[k]



＠Dr. Roman
maybe she's just barely keeping it under control when she's near danger, perhaps?
[k]

？1：She seems stronger during combat, actually.

？！

[communicationCharaFace 5]

Is it the same as the way Kintoki said he's overflowing with power?

W-Well, I'm just glad it's not interfering with the battle.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I don't know what's going on, but clearly, there's some kind of alcohol in the air there.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Until we can deal with the root cause, it won't go away.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
You'll have to make the best of what you've got.
[k]



＠Dr. Roman
...Oh, right. I did come up with a plan.[sr]Something I wanted you to try when you had the time...
