I see, so that's why you brought me here.[sr]You want me to purify this place.
[k]

＠Martha
I don't know if it can be done, but let me try.[sr]First I'll sprinkle a little holy water...

That's amazing! The poisonous puddles are disappearing... The stench in the air is clearing up too!

I can give you as much as you want, but what's more important is faith.

Without faith, the water is meaningless.

But something else will take root again in this place now, and surely bloom.

＠Scáthach
That poisonous ground was meant to molder the island's land. It was fortunate that we could purify it this early.
[k]

＠Scáthach
I feared that, if neglected, the island would have transformed into a land of death that could not grow a single weed in the end.
[k]

＠Scáthach
At the very least, this island is rich in its natural resources. I cannot see them all gone to waste.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Scáthach
...I can't believe this. Not only are you asking others to take care of the monsters for you, you're even asking the same people to take care of your environment?
[k]

＠Scáthach
I don't know if the ruler has forgotten about this island or just abandoned it, but I just added one more entry to the list of items I want to complain about.

Selfish behavior will only lead to your own demise.[sr]What are you after? Tell me, look me in the eyes and spit everything out.

It seems there's another place the piglet wanted to take us to. In other words, another place plagued by the poison.
