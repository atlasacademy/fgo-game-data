So I hope that, if nothing else, it will remain in your memories, [&Sir:Lady] [%1].

I don't have any grudges, and no civilians around means there were no massacres or other atrocities.

Oh, and it's nice that Hektor's not here either.

If you ever end up summoning me,[sr]I'll figure out a way to get along with him.

Hmm... Well, let's just say we went through a lot together, and most of it was less than friendly.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Achilles
That said, I'm a Servant now. I'm sure if I got summoned,[sr]I'd forget any problems I had with him.

What I really want to say is that I bet I could have a lot of fun fighting alongside you guys again.

So if you ever find yourself in a tight[sr]spot in Greece, just gimme a call.

I'll come running, no matter when or where you are.[sr]Promise.

All this time, I thought that you and I...

＠Evil Dragon
So, you would call me your friend?

＠Evil Dragon
...Thank you. I will always cherish this memory.[sr]But, there's something else I need to say.

＠Evil Dragon
There is nothing I can do for you,[sr]nothing I can give you after all you did for me.

＠Evil Dragon
All I could do was stand around...even with all[sr]those heroes willing to risk their lives helping.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
I can't tell you how sorry I am about that.

？1：It's fine. Really.

＠Evil Dragon
...That only makes me feel worse.

＠Evil Dragon

＠Evil Dragon
You're a very positive person,[sr]aren't you, [%1]? I'm afraid I...

...Hm?[sr]You know, now that I think of it, I had fun too.
