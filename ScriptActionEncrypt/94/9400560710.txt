That's right. Giving form to our determination will make it easier to rally everyone together.

It's too embarrassing to see my own statue, so no thanks.

＠Kiyohime
Although, if Master were to secretly carve a small wooden bust of me and sleep with it every night... Ehehehe, just thinking about it makes me excited.

That statue would serve the same purpose as a war god statue right? In that case, shouldn't we base it on the most powerful one here? I ain't gonna tell you who, though.
