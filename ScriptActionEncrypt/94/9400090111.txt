Yes. There was a Holy Grail War in our world,[sr]but the Grail was tampered with by some strange technology.
[k]

＠Sakura Saber
At the end of all that tampering, its power got out of control...

Unfortunately, I got involved in the accident and my subconscious materialized.[sr]It's starting to[line 3]corrupt reality.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Demon Archer
Worst of all, it took away most of my power. Originally I[sr]should be OP like a Last Boss, but now I'm like a 0.5 star Servant...
[k]

＠Demon Archer
In short, I got nerfed to a level 1 noob.
[k]


？1：Star?
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]
[charaFace D 4]
＠Demon Archer
With my power, I should've been a 5-star character.[sr]Why did it end up like this...
[k]

I'm sorry our Archer is causing you so much trouble.

So that indescribable creature is the manifestation[sr]of Demon Archer's subconscious and power?

Y-Yeah. I don't quite understand it myself,[sr]but that seems to be the case.

＠Sakura Saber
This has nothing to do with you,[sr]I'm sorry that you've gotten involved.

＠Sakura Saber
It's basically all Archer's fault, so please complain to her as much as you want.

By the way, I found this during the earlier battle.[sr]...A bowl? Perhaps? And a steel pot?

Looks like the magical energy leaking from the Grail[sr]copied what's “valuable” in my mind.

Valuable? A black pot and an old bowl...[sr]They don't look like they're that valuable...

Mash, can I have a look at them?[sr]Hmm, hmm...

What is this? Such dusty looking vessels are[sr]valuable in the Far East?

Well, even if you claim this is valuable...[sr]Wait, now that you mention it...

[communicationCharaFace 1]
＠Da Vinci
[line 3]I'm curious! These tea set-like things?[sr]My workshop will take them!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Mash
You're interested in them?
[k]


[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
Just look at this black, unsightly teapot![sr]Quality iron, smooth to the touch...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...But is super dull in shape and color. Still, I feel like it[sr]has an indescribable charm, or maybe not so much?
[k]


？1：That's what she meant by “simple and subdued!”

Oh, you are quite knowledgeable.[sr]I'll make you some tea later.

＠Demon Archer
Let's see, I'll rent out an entire temple somewhere...
