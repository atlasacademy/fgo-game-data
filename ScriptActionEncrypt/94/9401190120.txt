...
[k]

？1：Um...
？2：...Thanks for saving me.

？！

＠Meltryllis
...So, have you gotten your bearings, [%1]?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
No need to thank me.[sr]I was just looking for a Master myself.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
I'm sure this is all very new and strange to you, but try to calm down.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Come on. I'll explain the basics on the way.
[k]

？1：Are you a Servant...?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
Yes. I may not be a Heroic Spirit, but I am a Servant. We'll come back to that later.
[k]

？2：I don't recall telling you my name...

[charaFace A 5]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Meltryllis
I overheard it during your talk with BB. You could've figured that out for yourself if you'd tried.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
You're not very bright, are you?[sr]It's very annoying.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
...
[k]

？1：(...Is she mad at me?)
？2：(...Is she staring at me?)

？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Meltryllis
No. I'm appraising you, to see if you're a puppet worthy of being my Master.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Meltryllis
Hmm... Relax. You pass, if only barely.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
And don't worry. I won't dispose of you after I'm done using you either.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
I'll tell you what. If you manage to be a good Master for me right to the end, I'll definitely probably send you back to your own world.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
So if I were you, I'd do what I say for now.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
If you have even a modicum of sense, you won't do anything foolish like end our contract.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Especially since SE.RA.PH is brimming with enemies, like Suzuka and that attack program she had with her.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
A mere human like you can't survive here on your own.[sr]You need a Servant to keep you safe.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
From the looks of you, I'm guessing you're a failed Master who couldn't manage to form a contract with any decent Heroic Spirits?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Then you should be overjoyed that a goddess like myself has deemed you worthy of her aid.
[k]

？1：You're a goddess?

[charaFace A 6]
＠Meltryllis
Yes. Specifically, I'm a High Servant amalgamation of multiple goddesses.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
As a Master, I believe you're able to see a Servant's stats?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Go ahead and check mine later.[sr]You'll be shocked when you see what I'm capable of.
[k]

？2：(...Is this her idea of being nice?)

[charaFace A 2]
＠Meltryllis
Don't just stand there with that blank look on your face. Makes you an eyesore.
[k]

？！
[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_53 1.4]
[charaFace A 6]
＠Meltryllis
At any rate, let's push on. The front gate here may be completely digitized, but some of the other facilities are still intact.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_1 1.1]
＠Meltryllis
Let's see...
[k]

＠Meltryllis
We can start by heading for the main oil deck cable area, and sneak into the main facility from there.
[k]

[messageOff]

[wt 0.5]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
If you stay in digitized areas like this corridor, you'll eventually be disintegrated.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
After a few hours or so in a place like this, humans end up converted to data and imported to SE.RA.PH. Not a concern for me, though.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Even Servants won't last more than a few days.[sr]BB may have said this is a game, but don't trust her.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
There is nothing fair or balanced about this game. Everyone will be converted into data well before SE.RA.PH reaches the bottom of the trench.
[k]

？1：Wh-what do you mean!?
？2：But she said we'd reach there in a few hours...

？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Meltryllis
In the real world, yes. But in SE.RA.PH, time passes a hundred times quicker than it does in reality...
[k]

＠Meltryllis
As such, one minute of real-world time is equivalent to one hundred minutes here.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
So yes, in reality, you will reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench in two and a half hours.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
But to us here in SE.RA.PH, that two and a half hours will seem like ten days.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
What's more, while SE.RA.PH may be based off of Seraphix, it is actually far larger.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Understand? You could use all the time remaining to you, and still not be able to conquer this place.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
On top of that, you'll only be able to walk around here for about two and a half hours without a break.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Can't you tell that your body is already starting to be converted into data?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
In two and a half hours, you'll be fully imported into SE.RA.PH, so we need to find a safe area to serve as a base before that happens.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
...Well? Are you following me so far?
[k]

？1：(She lost me, but I guess I'll nod.)
？2：(I get that things are really bad, at least.)

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
...Good. That saves us time.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Let me do all the fighting. You just worry about reaching a safe area as soon as[line 2][se ad77][seVolume ad77 0 0.4][charaFace A 5]What?
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_1 0.7]

？1：Well, since you're helping me out...


？2：I just thought we could shake on it...

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
Shake on it...?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Seriously? Did you not hear me say you don't have any time to spare?
[k]

？1：...Sorry.
？2：If you don't want to, that's okay...

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Meltryllis

[k]

＠Meltryllis
Hold it. Wait just a moment.
