The horizon stretching out forever. The endless sky with not a single rooftop in sight. The times when Senpai and I would just stand side by side enjoying the cool breeze.

The way my shirt clung to me after I sweated buckets in the heat, and how even though it was heavy and unpleasant, I didn't even mind.
[k]

＠
Senpai and I running until we were out of breath to get to the finish line in time.
[k]

＠
The way everyone's vehicles screamed by like thunder, their speed blowing our hair completely out of place.
[k]

＠
How cool and refreshing that felt...and then how Senpai and I saw how unkempt each other's hair was, and how much that made us laugh.

Our roles may have been very mundane this time,[sr]instead of leading ones...
