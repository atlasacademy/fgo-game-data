Oh, chocolates. Didn't some emperor love to drink something related to these?

＠Alexander
Let's see... This does seem like a gift from the heart...
[k]

＠Alexander
So I need to reciprocate. What would you like?
[k]

？1：You can wait until next month.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Alexander
Haha! No, that doesn't sit well with me.[sr]Hmmmm...
[k]

？2：Oh? You're going to give me something?

＠Alexander
A king cannot simply take a gift without giving one in return. Someone once taught me that... I can't remember who though.
[k]

＠Alexander
Unless... Maybe it was him. Or her?[sr]Either way, it brings back memories.
[k]

＠Alexander
The grown-up me would probably say something like “You take what you want by conquering it!”
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Alexander
Okay, I've got it.[sr]Let me give you one of my favorite things!

This thing here is a scroll from my time. And the other one is a paperback book from your time.
[k]

＠Alexander
I guess paperbacks are better to carry around. You can read either of them whenever the mood suits you.
[k]

＠Alexander
Oh, right. Just be careful of one thing.
[k]

＠Alexander
The scroll, you know, is in Greek.[sr]Ancient Greek, mind you, not the modern language.
[k]

＠Alexander
If you can't read it...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Alexander
Maybe...[wt 0.5][charaFace A 1] I can read it to you, like a bedtime story.
[k]
