My, look at how you're inhaling that, Fou.

＠Mary
They're delicious cooked and raw.[sr]Cabbages are great.
[k]


？1：You were saying cabbage was a savior...?
？！

＠Anne
Yes. They saved sailors from a certain disease.
[k]

＠Anne
...A scary disease called scurvy.
[k]

＠Mary
Even in our era, many sailors died from scurvy.[sr]If only we'd known about it sooner...
[k]


？1：Scurvy?
？2：I think I've heard of that...

＠Mash
Scurvy is a disease that comes from a lack of vitamin C. It used to be a real problem for sailors on long journeys.
[k]

＠Mash
But once sauerkraut, or pickled cabbage[line 2]which is high in vitamin C[line 2]began to be used as preserved food...
[k]

＠Mash
it finally became possible to prevent scurvy.

＠Anne
That's right. So I figured that cabbage would also be good luck for us pirates.

Luck is something very important to us pirates.

＠Mary
On a sea voyage, so much of what's around you is beyond your control.
[k]

＠Mary
And we had to live with that for a long time, in a place where everyone's lives were on the line.
[k]

＠Mary
In a situation like that, you'd want to cling to anything that might bring good luck.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Anne
All kinds of stuff used to happen on long voyages.
[k]

＠Anne
Picking a certain kind of food can change everyone's fate...
[k]


？1：I'm sure these cabbages will bring us good luck.
？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Anne
Yes, you're right, Master.
[k]

＠Mary
Okay, I'm tired of eating them raw.[sr]Let's make some other type of cabbage dish.
