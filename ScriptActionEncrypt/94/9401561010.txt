They say truth is stranger than fiction.

＠Voice
After all... The world we live in is just a construct of our own senses.
[k]

＠Voice
And so we live in this unending mummer's farce, clinging to the delusion of hope.
[k]

＠Voice
That is, if we Heroic Spirits, who are no more than the shadows of the deceased, could be said to “live.”
[k]

＠Voice
Truth put to paper is merely a story, and experience itself is no more than a narrative constantly being revised within one's mind.
[k]

＠Voice
To borrow Shakespeare's words, “All the world's a stage. And all the men and women merely players.”
