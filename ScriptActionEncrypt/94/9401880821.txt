＠Voice
HEH... HAHAHA.[sr]HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
[k]

＠Voice
Now do you see?[sr]You never stood a chance!
[k]

＠Voice
There is no one in the underworld who can hope to defeat Ereshkigal!
[k]

＠Voice
Absurd. You should have seen the futility of your struggle, but you persisted in this ill-conceived venture.
[k]

＠Voice
Just how foolish are you?[sr]Is your skull empty of anything but air?
[k]

＠Voice
Then again, humans were originally born from clay.[sr]I suppose there was no chance of you being intelligent!
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
...
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
...I'm sorry. I apologize for Nergal's harsh remarks.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
But, I can't blame him for thinking that.[sr]Your recklessness defies comprehension.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
...I will ask you one more time.[sr]Why did you come all this way?
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
To save Chaldea from the Sumerian Fever?
[k]

？1：Because...

？！

？1：...I couldn't give up on you.
？2：I wanted to see you again, Ereshkigal.

？！

＠Voice
Ahh... So this is what it means to pour salt on a wound. How tragic. It brings tears to my eyes.
[k]

＠Voice
Tears of mirth, you pathetic cretins![sr]You've come all this way only to fail!
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
...I see.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Thank you for trying to help me.[sr]I do appreciate that...and I'm sorry.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
But...there's nothing you, or I, or anyone can do now.[sr]I cannot accept your kindness. I have no right.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
After all, I've already cast it aside myself.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
I no longer have any precious reason to[line 2]

I was waiting for you to mention it.[sr]For a while, it looked like it might never happen.

[charaFace A 7]

＠Altera Santa
But you finally mentioned something precious.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Which means this belongs to you after all.[sr]It's not right for me to keep it.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
All right...

Something a certain little sheep entrusted to me...
[k]

＠Altera Santa
The very memories that Ereshkigal discarded.
