＠Caesar
Ahh, how good of you to come here.[sr]I thought you might never arrive.
[k]

＠Caesar
I'm afraid I can't welcome you properly, given my position and all, but of course, that is but a mere formality.
[k]

＠Caesar
Mhmm, mhmm... Verbal agreements, you know?[sr]No evidence, no documentation... Just our word of honor.
[k]

＠Caesar
After all, is it documents that enable us[sr]to trust one another? Is it our job titles?
[k]

＠Caesar
Of course not. It is the impressions we[sr]impart by virtue of the life we lead.
[k]

＠Caesar
As such, in our case, there can be nothing BUT trust between us. At the very least, I can say with absolute confidence that I would trust you all with my life!
[k]

？1：Wow, I had no idea you felt that way...!
？2：I don't know where this is coming from, but I'm touched!

I may have only come to Chaldea recently, but I too know better than to trust this man blindly.

I have been warned about him! Many have told me that[sr]if I am not careful, he will eat me for breakfast!

No no, you've got me all wrong, my silver-haired maiden. They were merely warning you of my voracious appetite.
[k]

＠Caesar
The phrase may be foreign to you, but I assure[sr]you it is quite common in the modern parlance!
[k]

＠Caesar
Chaldea's food reserves only have so much to spare, you see, so I'm afraid big eaters like myself are often viewed with suspicion. It is sad, but a burden I must bear...

Now, now, I was just having a bit of fun.[sr]Let me be clear: what you see is what you get with me.

＠Caesar
I understand you may find it odd that a Heroic Spirit so harmless as I is here guarding this upper floor...
[k]

＠Caesar
...but I assure you there is[sr]no great significance in it.
[k]

＠Caesar
Just look at my bright red coat.[sr]A Red Oni (ROMA Style), in the flesh!
[k]

＠Caesar
Yes, the only reason I am here is because[sr]I accepted an offer of employment...
[k]

＠Caesar
One that I did so readily,[sr]given that it aligned with my own interests.

Why, naturally...the fact that[sr]this entire tower belongs to me.

？！

[bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]

＠Caesar
Were you all granted permission to enter my property?[sr]You weren't, were you?
[k]

＠Caesar
Then you are trespassing... Or, as they say in Master's country, you are breaking and entering.
[k]

＠Caesar
And that, I am afraid, is a felony offense, the penalty for which is a hefty fine or a rather lengthy prison sentence.
[k]

＠Caesar
High-powered attorney that I am, I would counsel you to pay the fine rather than submit to penal servitude.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Caesar
Since you have been caught red-handed, I expect you to pay immediately, but I am nothing if not flexible. As such, I will accept payment in QP in lieu of cold hard cash.

When he said he'd show me how he could be the man of my dreams, I simply couldn't say no!

Indeed. As you can see, everything is in place. Every high-powered attorney needs a beautiful secretary, after all.

[charaFace C 3]

＠Caesar
And well, as for the most beautiful woman I[sr]know...does she even need an introduction?

Even I get bashful from time to time.[sr]Especially in front of the woman I love.

Just a moment. Back on the ground, Shuten-Douji explicitly told us to climb up this tower.

Does that not mean we were, in fact,[sr]invited to these premises?

＠Caesar
Hah! As everyone knows, audio recordings are only hearsay, and so are not admissible. Phew. Bullet dodged.
[k]

＠Caesar
Now, getting back to the law... Why did I await you here on an upper floor, rather than one of the lower ones?
[k]

＠Caesar
Because this tower is akin to a high-rise apartment building, with each floor considered its own domicile.
[k]

＠Caesar
In order to reach this seventieth floor, you must have broken into all of the other domiciles.
[k]

＠Caesar
And as a high-powered attorney, I have, of course, drawn up contracts with all the other tenants allowing me to litigate on their behalf.
[k]

＠Caesar
As you can see, I've even taken the liberty of[sr]preparing their damage reports ahead of time!
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Caesar
Which is to say, you must now render unto me a trespassing penalty fine for all seventy floors!
[k]

＠Caesar
Hahaha! Had I waited for you on the tenth floor,[sr]I would not have collected a seventh of that fine!

A fair question. Essentially, I ran out of[sr]funds after one too many gourmet tours.
[k]

＠Caesar
Additionally, I frequently encountered beautiful women with no one else to turn to, so I would buy them a house and enjoy a single night of romance with them.
