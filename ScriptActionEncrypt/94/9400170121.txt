[line 3]Ahh, I killed it.
[k]

＠Brynhild
The vile enemy that stood between us is dead.[sr]It's all over now.
[k]

＠Brynhild
How unfortunate...[sr]But, yes, this may be for the best.
[k]

＠Brynhild
If I remain with you any longer, I would surely... be in greater and greater trouble...
[k]

＠Brynhild
...Therefore, let us part for now.
[k]

？1：Will we meet again?

[charaFace A 0]
＠Brynhild
Yes, yes. Until that day...
[k]

？2：We'll meet again.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Brynhild
...That's right. Someday, when the stars align and our paths cross...
[k]

？！

＠Brynhild
Take care, and stay healthy, my fleeting and fragile, but strong and stout, beloved human child.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Brynhild
I'm sure that when we meet again, I'll be of assistance.
