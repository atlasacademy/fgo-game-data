Subscription list, you know. The subscription list.[sr]This is just like that time. You remember that, right?

＠Benkei
On our way to Hiraizumi, when we crossed the border of Kaga, and that Togashi fellow spotted you, Lord Yoshitsune.

＠Benkei
I read a false subscription list, and later I ended up having to slap you around[line 2]
[k]

[charaTalk D]

＠Ushiwakamaru
...You dare to speak of the subscription list? Do you even understand the meaning behind the tears shed by Benkei?

Of course I understand.[sr]I am not Benkei just for the fun of it.

I'm not angry. It was all thanks to Benkei that we got past that point.
