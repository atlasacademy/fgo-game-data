The Cursed Book has transformed into an Eastern-style hydra! Be careful, it has a lot of magical energy, too!

She really was serious about not wanting Master here to see what the book was... The author in me sympathizes.

All right, I'm not here to judge. Let's take down this serpent and I guess try not to hurt Osakabehime much!
