Whoa there, let's not go jumping to conclusions before I've had a chance to share the results of my analysis! It isn't actually Medb the Heroic Spirit who just disappeared here.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It was just an imitation of her Spirit Origin created by superdense magical energy[line 2]namely, the Kamuy's Gold.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She was more like a Shadow Servant,[sr]or even just a shell of one, than anything else.

The real Medb is still alive and well,[sr]as far as I know.
