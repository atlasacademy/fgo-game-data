But there's more to stories than just their structure and plot. They must also have themes!

The theme shapes everything about a story. It's the soul of the work; the core idea that answers the question of why the author wrote it.

And every writer worth the ink in their pen knows trying to continue a story when you don't know the theme can only result in a mess.

＠Andersen
Instead of outsiders like us taking over, we have the cast continue on in the spirit they inherited from their director...
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

＠Andersen
Yes, I doubt Murasaki would have anything to cry about in that case. Brilliant, William! Truly cunning!
[k]

＠Andersen
We've got a mansion with a lot of history, a beautiful widow who inherited a fortune, and a bizarre assortment of guests...
[k]

＠Andersen
It's a damn near perfect setting for a mystery. Off the top of my head, you could call it something like “A Meihousou Most Foul.”

Hmm, the problem is, I would never come up with such a slapdash scheme. I prefer my schemes to have wrapped up nicely before anyone knows something is amiss.

＠Shakespeare
While the idea of writing a mystery based on one of Sir Moriarty's criminal plots does sound appealing, I'm afraid I'll need to give it a pass this time.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
When writing a mystery, you begin with the end and work backwards. Every character introduced must have a purpose and everything should be wrapped up neatly in the end.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Conversely, such stories tend[sr]not to be particularly dynamic.

＠Andersen
Right. If everything fits together too neatly, the story starts to feel robotic.
[k]

＠Andersen
Ideally, you want the characters to ignore the writer's carefully laid plot entirely and start going about their own affairs.
[k]

＠Andersen
Don't worry. As long as you all commit yourselves to your parts, the rest of the story will basically write itself.

Listen to me. Every last one of you is already a character. You're all famous enough to be engraved onto history itself. You're inherently interesting just by your very existence!
