Looks like they have no intention of letting us leave.[sr]Fine by me! Let's keep on moving then!
[k]

？1：This may be moot at this point, but is it really okay for me to be here?
？！

[charaFace F 9]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Please don't call attention to that.[sr]I'm trying my hardest not to think about it.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Of course [&it's against the rules for men:there are strict rules about who gets][sr]to enter the Ooku, but those are bound to change with the times.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Besides, there are clearly more important[sr]things to worry about right now.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
In fact, now that I really think about it...!
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
This hallway is just like the Osuzurouka we were just in! The sliding doors, the walls, the ceiling, the flooring, the decorative transom...
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
None of it is like the Ooku I know! Not one bit!
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
And if this isn't the real Ooku, which it clearly isn't, then I don't have to worry about the rules! In fact, I'll be damned if I do!

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Of course, being a woman of the cloth as I am, I have never seen such a place before, let alone entered one...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
...but I never expected such lurid lighting and...intimate quarters... Oh, I can practically feel the dark passion here crowding out the very air itself...
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
In fact, I can't help but notice something sweet roiling about in these walls, so thick it all but chokes me...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
But, I suppose that is hardly a surprise.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
The Ooku is a cloistered palace where the press of warm bodies and passion can be felt at all hours...is it not?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
Oh, no, no. Don't worry. I am not here to condemn such things. It is, after all, necessary for the survival of the species...
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
To be alive is to be slave to the[sr]desires of the flesh, you know...

Uh, no, this isn't normal at all! I'm afraid you have some very, very big misconceptions about the Ooku, Lady Sessyoin!
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
The real Ooku is nothing like[sr]this dim subterranean labyrinth.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Yes, it's broad and complex, but it was also clean and spacious and perfectly pleasant. It even had a garden!
[k]

[charaFace F 7]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Besides, the Ooku is reserved solely[sr]for the shogun's wife and concubines.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Its purpose is to ensure a safe place in which to produce an heir to the Tokugawa family! That is why it exists!
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
If you think the shogun simply goes about laying his hands on any woman in the place who happens to catch his eye, like the harems you may have heard about in other countries...
