＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
I come bearing good news, [%1]. One[sr]of the treasures we need is a tree branch with jeweled fruit from Hourai Island, yes?
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Well, it would seem that a Servant in possession[sr]of one such branch just made a reservation.
[k]

？1：Then we just need to convince them to let us have it!

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
True. However, this Servant is very much at odds with Chaldea. In fact, she may currently be your fiercest opponent.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
As such, any straightforward attempts[sr]to win her over are guaranteed to fail.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
So why not let me handle this one?

Yes, that sounds good. I'm especially partial to the bed in the far back. The shade there is just right.

I must say, though, I'm surprised I hadn't heard a peep about this place for the last three hundred years.[sr]I thought you had finally closed up shop.
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
I'm impressed you've managed to keep this place going among the wretched humans and their society.[sr]It reminds me of the Peach Blossom Spring.
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
In one sense, it's like you don't know when to give up. Hehe, though I suppose I'm not one to talk...
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
Oh, don't feel like you need to go easy on me.[sr]I absolutely love the Enma-tei's massages...
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
My body may be immortal and unaging, but it still gets stiff... If anything, the fact that it is so durable only makes it worse...
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
The more time passes, the stiffer my body[sr]grows, and there is no getting rid of it...
[k]

[charaFace E 3]

＠Yu Mei-ren
Cursed humans... If they only knew the pain of immortality, they would never claim jealousy...[sr]Ahh, yes, that's the spot. Go on, put your back into it...
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
Ahh, how I missed this... This is truly what[sr]it means to be rejuvenated... Although...

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
My wife suffered from the same sort of ailment, you see. She would always complain about stiffness whenever she visited the human world.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
I searched far and wide for a way to help, eventually finding the very best masseuse in the entire world.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
His hands relieve tension, improve circulation,[sr]and make you feel like new, whether human or fairy.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
It must be fate that brought us together here.[sr]What do you say? Shall I introduce you to him?
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
Hmph. So in the end, you are merely trying to ingratiate yourself with me.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Yu Mei-ren
Very well, I will play along with your little ploy. If nothing else, this should be an amusing diversion to help pass my endless time.
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
Go ahead and call for this expert masseuse of yours. If he should actually rid me of my stiffness, I will give you anything you ask for.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Hahaha, I'm glad to reach an understanding so quickly. This stiffness must truly be a great source of stress for you. All right then...you're up, Mr. Masseuse!
