Oh my, Master! Vive la France! It certainly is another lovely day, isn't it![wait tVoice]

Giving sweet, sweet gifts to those you care about... What a wonderful tradition this is, don't you think?[wait tVoice]

I have one for you too, of course. It isn't much, but I do hope you'll accept it.[wait tVoice]

You're practically my companion, after all, so I have to make sure to give you something really special, right?[wait tVoice]

Oh, right, I almost forgot. Can I make just one request?[wait tVoice]

Don't tell Amadeus or Sanson about this, okay? It would be a big ordeal if they found out I gave you chocolate.[wait tVoice]

I gave it a lot of thought, and I decided to make separate gifts for everyone. It seemed like it would work...[wait tVoice]

...but then they immediately started fighting about who had the bigger gift, or that the amount of sugar was equal to the amount of love, and other silly things![wait tVoice]

This is supposed to be a day of love and affection, not a day of quarrels and squabbling![wait tVoice]

So that's why I'm asking. If they do end up finding out, that's okay, but if possible...[wait tVoice]

...I'm hoping we can keep this our little secret, Master.[wait tVoice]
