Gosh, Chacha had no idea about any of that.

＠Chacha
Chacha was having so much fun in the furry park that Chacha didn't even notice you were gone.

＠Demon King Nobunaga
Anyway, I was wondering where you were. I never guessed you'd be living it up in the park I wasn't allowed into.

Still, I was really happy that you all came to find me. Joyful, even.

？1：I'm just glad we were able to find you.

＠Okita Alter
Next time, I'll research my destination before I go, then I'll make a list of everywhere I plan to visit.
[k]

？2：Maybe we should stick a GPS on Rengoku...

＠H：Rengokuken
C'mon, don't do that. No one's gonna be afraid of a demonic sword with a GPS on it.

It's a little terrifying that something so small could manifest a world so complex. I hope I never have to go back in there again.
