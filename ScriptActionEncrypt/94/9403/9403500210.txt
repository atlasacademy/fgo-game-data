Hmm. So you came across Tsubone's soul while you were being drawn here, and decided to help her on a whim.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
That's right. I realized that sharing my Spirit Origin with her was the only thing I could do to save her.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
I knew it was only a stopgap,[sr]but I just couldn't look the other way.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Pārvatī
But thanks to that, my own definition became less clear, and I think that's why I was able to escape the enemy's forced summoning.

So it all worked out in the end. I don't even feel any kind of force pulling on me anymore.

＠Sion
Of course, Mr. Goredolf is human, so I doubt he is sharing his body with someone else, like Pārvatī.

[charaFace C 4]

Which can only mean that he has been brainwashed.

The quality of his magical circuits aside, that depends on how the Clock Tower evaluates a mage's talents.

＠Sion
It would be impossible for an outside enemy to hack our Rayshift equipment to conduct a mass reverse-summon while leaving everything else untouched.

So I suspected they might have used a more physical approach for that part...
[k]

＠Sion
...and it looks like they probably chose[sr]to do this by using Mr. Goredolf.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Sion
They must have started by making contact with him and brainwashing him to their side.
[k]

＠Sion
He could then use his director security clearance to disable all of the Command Room's protections...
[k]

＠Sion
...after which, he was likely[sr]the first to be Rayshifted away.

I know what you mean. No matter how advanced a company's security might be, it is all too easy to make off with its data as long as you can sway someone who works there to your side.

＠Sion
After all, you do not even need to decrypt it if you can make off with the devices lock, stock, and barrel.
[k]

＠Sion
Honestly, it pains me to think that such a crass,[sr]inelegant solution could work this well.
[k]

[charaFace C 14]

＠Sion
At any rate, once the enemy had[sr]Mr. Goredolf under their control...
[k]

＠Sion
...they must have used his connections to all the other staff and Servants to reverse-summon them here willy-nilly.
[k]

＠Sion
...It must have taken an unbelievable amount of magical energy to do that. Much more than even a Holy Grail could provide.
[k]

＠Sion
The enemy would need something with an infinite... No, an inexhaustible resource for generating magical energy...

And Kasuga-no-Tsubone seems like she knows a lot about the Ooku. I'm sure her knowledge will be helpful.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
Of course we have to rescue Goredolf and all the others...but even putting them aside, I think I need to go there.

＠Pārvatī
Something tells me I need to confront whomever or whatever's behind all this, and that I'll find them in the Ooku.

...I cannot recommend charging into enemy territory before we have had a chance to create a campsite of our own...
[k]

＠Sion
But, you do have Pārvatī to help you in battle,[sr]and Kasuga-no-Tsubone to guide you around the Ooku.
[k]

＠Sion
So, after discussing it among my different thought processes, we have come to the consensus that it should be okay for you to go in there under these conditions.

So! “Make hay while the sun shines,” was it?[sr]Well, if we are going to do this, then let us do it!
[k]

＠Sion
Your next objective is to infiltrate the Ooku, investigate what is happening there, and rescue everyone who is trapped!

Oh, don't worry.[sr]I practically built the Ooku myself, you know.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
It might be a little more labyrinthine now, but I still know it like the back of my hand! Probably!

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Besides, now I have a goddess of India and her trusty companions here to help me.

Whatever sort of nasty person might have taken over the Ooku, I'm sure we can handle them just fine! Ah ha ha!
