＠Chief Retainer Mash
Senpai, I'm told there's a terrifying serpent god who lives in this cave cursing people to death and eating their remains.
[k]

？1：A serpent god, huh...

？2：That sounds pretty awful.

Oh yeah. A giant snake that was supposed to be a good omen or some shit appeared right before battle once, but then I killed him and ate him.

＠Serpent God
Foolish humans. I am just the victim of slanderous accusations... It's all a smear campaign.
[k]

＠Serpent God
I have never cursed anyone,[sr]let alone killed and eaten them.
[k]

＠Serpent God
It has always been humans' way to lay blame on what they do not understand whenever things take a turn for the worse.
[k]

＠Serpent God
So I would much rather stay here and read my book in peace than get mixed up in this GUDAGUDA nonsense.
[k]

＠Serpent God
So you can turn right around[sr]and go back the way you came.
