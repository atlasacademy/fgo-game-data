There is more to love than simple indulgence.[sr]At times, tough love is just as important.

Indeed, she is no longer a false Tokugawa either. She is now but a mere creature, and I have already cut her down.

＠Kama
Ow, ow, ow...![sr]Ugh, this is exactly why I hate having a body!
[k]

＠Kama
I always end up the victim![sr]It doesn't matter if I'm the god or a demon king of love!
[k]

＠Kama
People always say it's my fault there[sr]isn't enough love to go around!
[k]

＠Kama
That's why I tried to give them infinite love! I wanted to get back at them with every fiber of my being...!
[k]

＠Kama
I knew that a god who's meant to love others would never be loved herself!
[k]

＠Kama
That's why I had to love everyone. I had no choice but to dominate if I didn't want to feel like a victim anymore!
[k]

＠Kama
Aagh, this is the worst! I can't believe I've gone from the most powerful being in the world to the most pathetic...!
[k]

＠Kama
Please! I don't want it to end like this...!
[k]

＠Kama
There are still so many defective, detestable humans out there I haven't looked down on!

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
...True, it does feel good to love. Especially when the ones you love are clearly weak and in need of protection.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
All the more so if they are children.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Loving helpless people like that makes you feel needed. It makes you feel like you matter.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
It can be terribly frightening to put an end to that.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
But making a clean break with that desire...that obsession to keep loving someone forever...is a form of love we guardians must one day be willing to embrace.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
As they say, if you truly love something...you must be willing to set it free...
