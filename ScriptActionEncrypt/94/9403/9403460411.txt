If you three get mixed up in this now,[sr]it will only make the situation worse!

Now then, tell me, Master:[sr]Who do you think sent those thugs after us?

＠Moriarty
Every one of them is a viable suspect. They all have motive, opportunity, and the money with which to hire the thugs we've just dispatched.

＠Moriarty
However...
[k]

＠Moriarty
Just because they had motive, opportunity, and money to send people after us, does it necessarily follow that they did so?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Moriarty
What do you think?
[k]

？1：I don't think any of them are the type to go after someone like me.

[charaFace D 1]

＠Moriarty
Yes, exactly! The rules for these[sr]kind of skirmishes don't apply to you.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

？2：They're not exactly good people, but...

[charaFace D 1]

＠Moriarty
That's true. They are most certainly not good people.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Moriarty
But, neither are they so evil that they would readily[sr]order the murder of an innocent young [&man:lady].
[k]

？！

＠Moriarty
They are, of course, citizens of the[sr]underworld and mages, respectively.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Moriarty
Were it truly necessary to achieve their goals,[sr]I have no doubt they would kill us.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Moriarty
But by that same token, they would not go out of their way to kill us when there is no pressing need to do so.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Anyway, tonight is the final night,[sr]making tomorrow the final morning.
[k]

＠Moriarty
The morning when everyone shall draw the losing straw, and lose something precious to them.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]

＠Moriarty
All right, Master, let's bring[sr]this case to a neat, tidy close!
