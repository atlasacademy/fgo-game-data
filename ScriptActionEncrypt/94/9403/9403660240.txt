Just as I suspected.[sr]You forgot what you really were.

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Reines
Oh come now, it's obvious why[sr]she's been hiding all this time.
[k]

＠Reines
None of those other three could remember who went[sr]missing, or even when they went missing, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Reines
So what if the same was true for the ones in hiding?
[k]

？1：Oh, yeah!
？2：Right. If people forget who they are here...

？！

＠Reines
It seems you've arrived at the answer for yourself. We were in much the same predicament with our own amnesia at first.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Reines
And given that we have a giant in the form of Bunyan here, it only stands to reason that these missing persons might have special abilities of their own.
[k]

＠Reines
From there, we can deduce that they must have either gone missing somewhere other than the museum, or are otherwise wandering the museum aimlessly, waiting to be found.
[k]

＠Reines
Of course, they could have been hidden in a secret room as well, but as Trimmau said, there were no such rooms to be found here.
[k]

＠Reines
So I knew then that they were most likely invisible,[sr]or transformed into something else.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Reines
That's why I decided to try something[sr]that was sure to cause a bit of surprise.

I'm glad I didn't have to twist my head around more than once. It's not exactly the most becoming trick.
