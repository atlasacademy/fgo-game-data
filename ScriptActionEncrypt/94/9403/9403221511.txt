...This must be the mountain behind the inn... The last thing I remember is staring into Kiyohime's mouth stretching wider and wider...

That was awful... I can't believe she drop-kicked[sr]me AND turned into a snake to capture me...

＠Young Medusa
I guess the legends were true... No wonder Anchin managed to run away faster than the speed of sound...

Lady Gorgon's snake form would be a perfect fit for an action movie...while Lady Kiyohime's would be right at home in a horror film...

Still, why did Ms. Tomoe do this? I remember her saying something about dragon gems, but[line 2]

W-well, you know, she's at that age! She must have just wanted some pretty jewels that all the other ladies would be jealous of!

Tomoe Gozen, concerned with appearances...[sr]I doubt any but Lord Yoshinaka would have the patience.

＠Beni-Enma
All right, I'll clean things up around here.[sr]Cheep, you can go back to the inn now, Kiyohime.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I'll also make you some tea later, as an apology for putting you on trial when you were innocent.

...(Sigh) Well, it may not have been pretty, but at least we did get one of the five treasures.

＠Kiyohime
And since we don't want to worry Ms. Beni-Enma unless we absolutely have to...
[k]

＠Kiyohime
...let's just keep this to ourselves[sr]until we have all five of them, Master♡
