It's named after a saint named Valentinius who died in the late third century, right? Hehe, I wonder what he would make of all this...[wait tVoice]

Oh, come to think of it, I'm told there were actually two saints who went by Valentinius.[wait tVoice]

I'm even told there was a monk of the same name, though little is known about him.[wait tVoice]

These days, I believe Valentine's Day is simply defined as a holiday based on a historical clergyman.[wait tVoice]

If we were to trace its origins even further...some believe it began with Lupercalia, in ancient Rome...[wait tVoice]
