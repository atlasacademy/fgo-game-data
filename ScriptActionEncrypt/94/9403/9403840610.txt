＠Da Vinci
This is a generic version of a certain Atlas alchemist's device for conducting thought experiments.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's official name is “Logos Reenactor Generic.”
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Once you input your desired conditions, it simulates a limited observable environment in which to conduct the thought experiment virtually.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
One that's essentially indistinguishable from reality.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Actually, when you consider that you can set its parameters however you like, you could say it creates real experiences through a dreamlike state?

Theoretically, sure. But in practice, it doesn't seem to have worked too well.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Da Vinci
I checked out the records for its test runs, and the inventor doesn't seem to have been able to fix the setting meant to smooth over the discrepancies between the simulation and reality.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So as more paradoxes, inconsistencies, and bugs in the created world pile up, its environments eventually become Singularities.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Which, as you can imagine, is a pretty serious flaw.

Hmm, it was probably a gift or something. I'd guess it's from when Marisbury was still the director here.

Of course, I'm sure he knew it was dangerous, and would've made sure it was sealed away tightly...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Da Vinci
It'll take some time, but it might be that our only option is to have someone inside the simulation see it through to the end...

...and essentially beat the game by containing the Singularity and returning its world to proper history.
