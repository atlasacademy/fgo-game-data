Welcome back, [%1]!

＠Da Vinci
You must be pretty exhausted, huh? I'm sorry we got cut off so soon and couldn't help you out more!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Da Vinci
On top of that, looks like you had to clean up one of my messes this time. I'm especially sorry about that.
[k]

？1：No, that's really not right.
？2：It's okay. I'm sure it wasn't easy for you, either.

？！

[charaFace A 32]

＠Da Vinci
Hmph. Now that I think about it, this is the same sort of thing my predecessor did, isn't it! I know it's good to forget things sometimes, but still.

Well, I'm sure you had a rough go of it, being so helpless on your own and all, but I'm also sure you did your very best, and that's all any of us can be expected to do.

I think you've at least earned yourself a plate of Musik-style ultrafluffy pancakes topped with my special butter.

Indeed, I daresay this will be the perfect time to show off my masterful culinary skills. I can't have that cheeky Archer in red showing me up, now can I!

You said it. I never felt more despondent there than I did the moment I found out that Mash was an imposter.

＠El-Melloi II
I hope I never have to experience a shock like that again if I can avoid it.

？1：It looked like Mnemosyne was talking to someone at the end.

＠El-Melloi II
I'm guessing that was Reines's doing. Sima Yi's Noble Phantasm removes its target's advantages and exposes their weaknesses.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
If Mnemosyne saw Da Vinci in those final moments,[sr]that would mean that Da Vinci was her weakness.

By the way, El-Melloi II, I don't think you ever told us who it is that came with you from that Singularity?
