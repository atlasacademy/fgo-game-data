I'm afraid I couldn't make them by hand, but I did take my time choosing the very best ones.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V040]
When I was thinking about which ones would make you happiest, my heart kept pounding like an ordinary girl's.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 1]

[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V050]
So, what do you think?[sr]Do you like them?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V060]
You are the Master of Chaldea, after all. I'm sure you've already received more chocolate than you could ever eat...[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：I, uh, wouldn't say that...

＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V070]
Is that so? I'm glad to hear that. I see you have a deft touch with many things, [%1].[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V080]
But you should make a habit of looking people right in the eye when you talk to them, you know. Otherwise, you leave yourself open to attack.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V090]
For example...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V100]
Your eyes just wandered over to that closet, right? What would you do if there was a present in there?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：Even if I had, I've never gotten anything like this before!

[charaFace A 3]
＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V110]
I-I see... That's quite the comeback. I never even saw it coming.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V120]
It's a much more outrageous statement than I was expecting, but it does unmistakably get your feelings across... Master. I'm glad to hear that.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V130]
After all, I've never given anyone a valentine before, either. It wouldn't be fair for me to be the only one with my heart all atwitter, would it?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V140]
At any rate, I look forward to working with you again this year. I promise to do my very best to keep this dream going as long as I can.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V150]
Now then, you must be hungry, right? Why not try the traditional New Year's meal before the sweets?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：So that explains all the New Year's decorations...!

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V160]
That's right. I know I'm a bit late, but I thought I would take this occasion to wish you a happy New Year as well. I hope you don't mind that I overwrote your decor without asking.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V170]
The old New Years may be over now, but I'm still a proper Servant now, right?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V180]
That's why I took the liberty of cutting my way straight through the front gate. After all...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ryougi Shiki
[tVoice ValVoice_102800 0_V190]
...isn't it the mark of a top Servant to attack with weapons nobody else has?[wait tVoice]
