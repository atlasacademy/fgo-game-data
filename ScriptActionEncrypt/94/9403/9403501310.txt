My calling entailed listening to people speak of their troubles, helping them develop strategies for coping, uncovering the traumas they had buried deep within themselves, and then taking that pain away.

＠Sessyoin Kiara
...Yes, that's right. The title given to those who devote themselves to saving all living things is “bodhisattva.”
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
That is what I strive for: to do my best to save all living things, no matter how big or small or anything else.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Shujou-muhen-seigando.[sr]The vow to save all living things.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Houmon-mujin-seigangaku.[sr]The vow to learn as many things as possible.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Butsudou-mujou-seiganjou.[sr]The vow to seek enlightenment.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
...These are the various vows I have made to myself.[sr]I was simply doing my best to uphold them.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
But the desire to save others is still, in itself, a desire. That I once thought of this as my calling only shows how far I still am from enlightenment.
[k]

[charaFace E 9]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
But that is a paltry price to pay for one such as myself to save those in need, or relieve them of their own earthly desires.
[k]

Should it be necessary, I would gladly offer up my body...and soul in service to those in need.

Actions and emotions are inextricably linked.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Just as certain behaviors elicit specific feelings in an individual, so can this apply to any number of people.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
The opposite is true as well, to a degree. Creating feelings in someone can help determine how they may act.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
By way of example, let's say a group of people is exploring a maze, and they come to a fork in the path.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
It is not difficult to imagine that those most enthusiastic among their number might choose one path to take, while those favoring caution might choose another.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara

Those numbers I appended to the map are my estimates based on these theories.

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_11 1.0]
