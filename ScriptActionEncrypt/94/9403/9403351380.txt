Ah well, it's kinda nice going hunting just the two of us now and then. Embers, boars, whatever. If you're hunting, I'm there.[wait tVoice]

You sure you want to give this to me? There were plenty of others hoping for this stuff in the cafeteria, you know.[wait tVoice]

But, okay. Doesn't look like it'll be too filling, but I'm not about to turn down free food.[wait tVoice]

Master, so you know, I don't got anything to my name. Don't expect me to return the favor, all right?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：That's fine. I wasn't looking to get anything in return.

[charaFace A 1]

[tVoice ValVoice_300700 0_V090]
Haha, well that's good. In that case, don't mind if I do.[wait tVoice]

This isn't true for all of us, but some of us Heroic Spirits have been through Holy Grail Wars.[wait tVoice]

＠Cú Chulainn
[tVoice ValVoice_300700 0_V130]
And again, this isn't true for all of us, but some of us still retain some memories of those times.[wait tVoice]

...I'm one of them.[wait tVoice]

＠Cú Chulainn
[tVoice ValVoice_300700 0_V150]
I can't speak for the older me or the Caster me, but I fought, and killed, in a Holy Grail War a long time ago.[wait tVoice]

My Noble Phantasm was sealed off back then... As you know, it's incredibly powerful, but that also made it infamous.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
[tVoice ValVoice_300700 0_V170]
So my Master back then chose to keep it under wraps. Said we should keep our best card close to our chests.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：So then, this spear is...

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Cú Chulainn
[tVoice ValVoice_300700 0_V180]
Noble Phantasm or not, you're still gonna have to fight. And if you're gonna fight, you're gonna need a weapon, right?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
[tVoice ValVoice_300700 0_V190]
So this spear isn't Gáe Bolg...but a makeshift my Master at the time threw together in a hurry.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
[tVoice ValVoice_300700 0_V200]
It might not compare to the real deal, but as spears go, it works well enough in a pinch.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
[tVoice ValVoice_300700 0_V210]
For some reason, I'm still using it to this day. Before I knew it, it'd become my favorite spear.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
[tVoice ValVoice_300700 0_V220]
After all, I don't gotta worry one bit about treating it rough, so I don't have to hold anything back when I fight![wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cú Chulainn
[tVoice ValVoice_300700 0_V230]
You might not have much use for it yourself, but I want you to have it anyway. Don't worry, I've got several spares.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
[tVoice ValVoice_300700 0_V240]
It's a good weapon, you know? It holds up real well, even against a Sphinx.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cú Chulainn
[tVoice ValVoice_300700 0_V250]
...Though if you're going up against a sacred sword wielder, then it's a different story![wait tVoice]
