...but the Electrical Night Parade of a Hundred Pumpkin Oni is quite the spectacle, and takes up all of Main Street.
[k]

＠Salieri
That is when the Great Oni emerges from his lair to unleash a soul-rending howl that splits the very sky.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

It almost sounds like singing,[sr]albeit in a horridly perverted form.

At one point, the Great Oni asked me to compose[sr]an accompaniment for his...scream, but...

I had a bunch of time to kill after Sitonai's spell healed me, so I went out for a walk around the cabin and just ran right into him.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

He looked kind of lost and confused,[sr]so I brought him here.
[k]

＠Blackbeard
Thanks to Sitonai's barrier thingy here, I knew I wouldn't have to worry about him going back to Oniland.

I don't know what the Great Oni is trying to accomplish with that, but he must have taken a liking to Salieri.

Apparently he used a copy of him for the largest gold fragment, and even asked him to compose new, uh, songs.

It's a good thing we've got[sr]him here for safekeeping now.
