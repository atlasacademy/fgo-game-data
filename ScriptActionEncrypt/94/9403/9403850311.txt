You win. We surrender. The Sanada clan hereby pledges its loyalty to the Chaldea clan. To prove it, you can take my son, Emimura, as a hostage.

I see, I see. So by giving up your second child as a hostage, you demonstrate your loyalty to Chaldea.

[charaFace H 1]
＠Nagao Kagetora
But by keeping your eldest child here, you are able to retain your heir in case Chaldea is defeated.

＠Nagao Kagetora
Very clever.

So for the time being, I'm going to set aside my personal ties and simply play my part as another popular general.
