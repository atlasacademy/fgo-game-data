Hm? Oh, [%1]. Forgive me. I was so distracted I failed to notice you.[wait tVoice]

Good morning. This day is off to a wonderful start, now that I've gotten to see your face.[wait tVoice]

...In fact, it may be providence that you are here. I am certain you'll know what to do about this strange phenomenon.[wait tVoice]

Today, I have encountered a number of impossible events:[sr]Gift giving.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_300400 0_V080]
A number of Chaldea staff I've never even spoken to tried to give me chocolate for no discernible reason.[wait tVoice]

＠Karna
[tVoice ValVoice_300400 0_V090]
Can you believe that? It's already happened five times.[sr]And that's not all.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Karna
[tVoice ValVoice_300400 0_V100]
The same thing has also been happening to Rama, Geronimo, Robin Hood, Beowulf, and Li Shuwen.[wait tVoice]

＠Karna
[tVoice ValVoice_300400 0_V110]
Oh, I also saw Helena giving chocolate to Edison while he was bawling his eyes out for some reason.[wait tVoice]

＠Karna
[tVoice ValVoice_300400 0_V120]
I know one should be glad to receive gifts...but I am not Arjuna. There is no reason why anyone would give something to me.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Karna
[tVoice ValVoice_300400 0_V130]
And then we have a great man like Edison shedding tears. Surely these are the first signs of some sinister enemy plot?[wait tVoice]

？1：Edisooon! (Begin crying in sympathy)
？2：(Explain what Valentine's Day is)

＠Karna
[tVoice ValVoice_300400 0_V150]
...but I didn't know it took place today...[sr]I was told this event didn't concern us...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Karna
[tVoice ValVoice_300400 0_V160]
...by a women familiar with these sorts of things, so I completely forgot about it.[wait tVoice]

Now I feel bad for how I treated those staff...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Karna
[tVoice ValVoice_300400 0_V180]
I turned them all down, telling them I didn't need their gifts, and had nothing for them in return.[wait tVoice]

？1：So hey, funny story...

I made them out of materials I had lying around. They came out quite well, no? For once, I think I did a good job.[wait tVoice]

I did have Da Vinci help me with some of it, but I can still say without qualification that these are my creation.[wait tVoice]

...I did consider giving them to you as they were, but I didn't think you would like that.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Karna
[tVoice ValVoice_300400 0_V250]
So I reforged them to better suit you. Those are just the sort of lengths to which I'm willing to go.[wait tVoice]

＠Karna
[tVoice ValVoice_300400 0_V270]
If you could, it would make me very happy if you actually wore them, especially when no one else is around.[wait tVoice]

？2：Thank you, Karna.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Karna
[tVoice ValVoice_300400 0_V280]
Not at all. Thank you, [%1]. I will never forget the joy this day has brought me.[wait tVoice]

This chocolate truly is undying. Not even the sun could melt such sweetness. Of that, I am certain.[wait tVoice]
