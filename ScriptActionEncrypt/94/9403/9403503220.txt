How did I end up this way? Why, because Shiva incinerated me with his third eye, of course.

＠Scheherazade
The god Shiva was so deep in meditation that not even Pārvatī could reach him.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
The gods sent you to get Shiva's attention using your arrows of love, but when you did...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
...he flew into a rage and opened his third eye, turning your body to ash...

＠Kama
Let me tell you what happened as a result of getting dragged into that little shit show.
[k]

＠Kama
As you can tell from my expression,[sr]it's just hiii-larious.
[k]

＠Kama
Shiva's third eye, and the unfathomable power it possesses turned me to ash. That power was capable of incinerating the universe itself.
[k]

＠Kama
It didn't just disintegrate my body. It made my very existence into something vague and hazy.
[k]

＠Kama
Now, here's a question for you.[sr]Don't worry, it's a reeeal easy one.
[k]

＠Kama
Let's say there's a void left over from Shiva's incineration standing right in front of you. What is it, exactly?

But that wasn't the case for me.[sr]I was no ordinary god of love.

The divinity known as Kama is also considered to be a separate divinity known as Mara, though they are often conflated.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Scheherazade
As the embodiment of love and lust, Mara is said to be an ultimate evil, leading all she encounters to their doom!

＠Kama
So, I know I just said I was a demon king, but I'm still not sure there's any point in distinguishing between Kama and Mara.
[k]

＠Kama
We're both the same thing in the end. It's probably just a case of humans thinking of love as evil.

I always thought this could be a possibility. And I'm sure Sion and Mash considered that the two divinities were linked too, since it is a famous story.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
But, even if Kama and Mara are the same being, Mara shouldn't be able to come out that easily. So how is she here now?

Indeed, I can sense it myself. That is the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven Papiyas, Takejizaiten.

This innermost space inside the Tokugawa Ooku is now essentially my own self-contained universe.

[charaFace A 1]

Do you get it?[sr]You are all inside me, even as we speak.

So I wouldn't count on being able to use your bodies like normal if I were you.

So just give up and enjoy my love.

Let my love carry you into the depths of depravity, like Chubs there.

Kiara, is it?

Well, since you brought it up,[sr]I guess I'd better come clean.

[charaFace A 15]

＠Kama
True, my being Mara is nothing more than a premise.

The whole reason I'm here right now is because of another level of power I awakened.

You and I are two sides of the same avatar. You must have sensed when I was born in the rift that lies between us.

Isn't that why you came to stop me now that I'm one of the Evils of Humanity? Because it's your responsibility as the god closest to me?
