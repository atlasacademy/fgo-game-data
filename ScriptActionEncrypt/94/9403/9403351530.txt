I covered it with extremely specialized silver foil that's also chock full of Mahatma's blessings, so it's really resistant to magecraft![wait tVoice]

＠Helena
[tVoice ValVoice_502300 0_V050]
Restraining and containment spells won't even slow it down! Something like Mystic Eyes could probably work, but I don't have any![wait tVoice]

...I thought it would be perfect for you, since you're also a straight shooter who's always full of energy. I wanted to give you some chocolate that really fit you, you know?[wait tVoice]
