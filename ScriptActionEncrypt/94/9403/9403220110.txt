...Phew. It looks like we're here. I'm glad we didn't end up falling from a great height again.

I don't care about the hotel as long as I'm with Master...but it is odd that there isn't even a road.

Does this mean she deceived us?

This is the first time we've Rayshifted with these facilities, right? Maybe they accidentally ended up at a different destination than we did.

Easy there. Don't get yourself worked up. Director Goredolf's the one with the comms device, remember?

It's unfortunate that we're currently separated from him, but don't worry. I'll take care of that.

Given that Lord Fionn is nowhere to be seen, it would seem safe to assume he is still with Lord Goredolf.

＠Tomoe Gozen
I suggest we trust in Lord Fionn and Lord Diarmuid's battle prowess and continue on our way.

＠Tomoe Gozen
What's more, there is a brook here. When one is lost in the mountains, one cannot go wrong following water.

What do you say, Master? Shall we see if[sr]we can reach the top of this mountain?
