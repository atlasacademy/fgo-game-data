It is a symbol of my resolve to continue serving as your sword. I deliberated long and hard, but could think of nothing better to offer you.[wait tVoice]

It seems I have neglected to adequately explain myself once again. I hope you can forgive my imprudence.[wait tVoice]

My foresight told me you would be bestowing a gift upon me, so I prepared a return gift for you as well.[wait tVoice]

？1：Oh... Well, you're not wrong.

You have my thanks. ...Now I see. In the future,[sr]I should wait until I have confirmed receipt of a gift before initiating the return gift ritual.[wait tVoice]
[k]


＠Xiang Yu
[tVoice ValVoice_703200 0_V080]
It seems I must continue to pay close attention,[sr]so as to better align myself to your perception of what is happening “now.”[wait tVoice]
[k]


？1：You did kind of surprise me, but it's okay.
？2：Hey, not like this is the first time something like this has happened.
？！

＠Xiang Yu
[tVoice ValVoice_703200 0_V090]
You are too kind, Master. ...By the way, is there any particular reason you gave me this chocolate?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：You mean you didn't know!?
？！

＠Xiang Yu
[tVoice ValVoice_703200 0_V100]
My foresight is derived from an amalgamation of all my conscious and unconscious perceptions.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
[tVoice ValVoice_703200 0_V110]
As such, I can only look ahead to the culmination of events. I am unable to perceive the various causes and effects behind each individual event.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_703200 0_V120]
I was able to foresee that I would receive a gift of[sr]chocolate, and that I would need to prepare a gift for you in return, but I could not understand the reason for this exchange.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：It's because today is a day where we give gifts to the people we care for.
？！


[charaFace A 3]
＠Xiang Yu
[tVoice ValVoice_703200 0_V130]
...Then, this chocolate is a mark of affection? I, uh, don't know what to say. I am truly honored, and humbled.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Xiang Yu
[tVoice ValVoice_703200 0_V140]
I see. So this is part of today's celebrations. Ah, this world truly is full of surprises.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：You still get surprised? Even though you can see the future?
？！


[charaFace A 0]
＠Xiang Yu
[tVoice ValVoice_703200 0_V150]
True, there is a discrepancy in the way you and I perceive the events of the past, present, and future. But the element of surprise has nothing to do with chronological order.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Xiang Yu
[tVoice ValVoice_703200 0_V160]
Indeed, it is in the sense of surprise I get upon experiencing something new that I most feel alive.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_703200 0_V170]
Back when I was considered nothing more than a device for seeing the future, I could never have expected I would get to experience such happiness.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Xiang Yu
[tVoice ValVoice_703200 0_V180]
[%1], my leader. I must thank you again for giving me the gift of these strange new circumstances.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
[tVoice ValVoice_703200 0_V190]
I swear once again that I will serve you to the best of my ability in this new life as a Servant.[wait tVoice]
