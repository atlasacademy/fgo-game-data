＠Ryouma
I've been thinking about why Roma Kureishi came here,[sr]and what he hoped to accomplish.
[k]

＠Ryouma
Roma used to serve the nation's military, and reported directly to Miguel himself. He surely had plenty of official avenues for success if he had chosen to pursue them.
[k]

＠Ryouma
But instead, he chose to leave and practice medicine in a small town, even though the work of creating a new country had to have been much more interesting.

[charaTalk G]
[charaFace G 6]
[charaFadein G 0.1 1]

＠Ryouma
Right. And there's more to the legacy than just treasure. It's also packed with all kinds of sensitive documents.
[k]

＠Ryouma
I think Roma wanted to find it because he believed it contained the truth about his friend's disappearance.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]

＠Ryouma
If it turned out his friend was actually living a happy life somewhere else, great.
[k]

＠Ryouma
And in the more likely event that he wasn't...at least he would have some closure.
[k]

[charaFace G 6]

＠Ryouma
He couldn't turn to the police, since the unstable government still had its hands full maintaining order and developing the new nation.
[k]

＠Ryouma
So he decided to slip Gabriela a drug...
[k]

＠Ryouma
...and take advantage of the ensuing investigation to explore the Meihousou and look for Cortés's legacy.

Her glass wasn't actually poisoned. The wine she drank was just the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back.
[k]

＠Ryouma
Roma figured this out after a quick examination, and thought up a way to take advantage of her unconsciousness.
[k]

＠Ryouma
He pretended to give her an antidote, while actually giving her a powerful sedative.

I think Daizou's the kind of guy who would go down swinging, making sure to take as many enemies with him as he could.

But if he'd died in a blaze of glory like that,[sr]Roma would have long since heard about it, right?
