Hey there! Sorry for asking you to come all this way, [%1]. I hope you haven't been waiting too long.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V210]
As you're well aware, I'm a genius in all things and an exceptional artist. I might be good at anything and everything, but I never take the easy way out.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V220]
That extends to this particular situation too. There's no fun in giving you a valentine at Chaldea, right?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：I never expected to get one from you...

[charaFace A 3]
＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V230]
Really? Then I guess you didn't know how passionate I can be. I'm certainly not so frigid as to let a day like this go by without acknowledging someone I like.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V240]
The whole point of Valentine's Day is to express your affections and/or a desire to become more intimate, no?[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V250]
Then you'd better believe I'm gonna take advantage of that. But in my way, with style.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V260]
Well, I won't deny that it's an extremely material event, but as long as it's fun, I don't really care.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：It's almost like we're on a date.

[charaFace A 5]


＠Da Vinci
[tVoiceUser ValVoice_500900 0_V270 ValVoice_500900 0_V280]
An excellent reaction, [%1]! Now I'm especially glad I went out of my way to dress up![wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V290]
Hehe, today's a special day, after all. That's why I'm all decked out in my full set of equipment.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V300]
What's that? I'm always beautiful, but today I'm eye-poppingly beautiful? Oh you! You always know just what to say![wait tVoice]

But enough with the prelude.[sr]Let's get right to it.[wait tVoice]

In honor of your good fortune to date, and in hope of your successes to come, I give you...my ultimate chocolate![wait tVoice]

Why, you say? Oh come now, everyone knows things are that perfect in each and every way shine brightly, right?[wait tVoice]

＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V340]
Well, I suppose I might have gone a liiittle overboard with its appearance, but don't worry! I didn't taste it myself, but I'm sure it tastes good, too![wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Thank you, Da Vinci.
？2：I'm gonna hang it up in this very museum.

Well now. Mmm, I see. This must be the valentine effect.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V360]
I've never felt such simple words of gratitude resound so deeply before. Ooh, this is so hot! I can feel the creative juices welling up inside me![wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V370]
Then again, if I give in to my usual eccentricity now, I'll end up wasting this whole day, and I definitely don't want that. So I think I'll just hole up in my atelier for a little while![wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V380]
Don't worry, I'm sure my passion will subside in a couple of hours! Go ahead and bask in my art until I get back![wait tVoice]
