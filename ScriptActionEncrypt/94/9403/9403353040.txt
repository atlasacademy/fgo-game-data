Horses love sweets. They'll happily eat all you give them and more.[wait tVoice]

＠Red Hare
[tVoice ValVoice_403100 0_V180]
But they mustn't have caffeine.[sr]They cannot break it down... Or so I heard...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Red Hare
[tVoice ValVoice_403100 0_V190]
Well, I'm not completely certain about that, but I'm[sr]pretty sure it's true. So any sweets you give to a horse are best made with brown sugar.[wait tVoice]
