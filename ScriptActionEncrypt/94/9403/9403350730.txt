I'd never written a letter before...but you showed me everything I needed to know.

You taught me how to put my thoughts and feelings into words.

I'm told we celebrate it by giving form and voice to the feelings we harbor every day.
[k]

＠Murasaki Shikibu
It needn't necessarily take the form of chocolate. Whatever feelings you may have, you may write down in a letter...
[k]

＠Murasaki Shikibu
...be they gratitude, or affection, or anything else you may find yourself thinking of between missions...
[k]

＠Murasaki Shikibu
...I hope that letter successfully makes its way to its intended recipient.
