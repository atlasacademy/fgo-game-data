I have an obligation to you.[wait tVoice]

？！

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V020]
I am intellectually familiar with rules and manners that have been documented in writing...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V030]
...but I was completely unaware of Japan-only trends with their origins in foreign celebrations.[wait tVoice]

？1：And, that means...?
？2：Could you, um, maybe use some smaller words?

It was on sale bearing the slogan, “Obliged to give someone chocolate? Here. Get them these.”[wait tVoice]

Chloe told me that you can also give friendship chocolate to those you have affection for.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V140]
Then she said, “I want friendship chocolate from you, too☆” [tdelay 1 4.3 1][charaFace A 0][delay -]So I made sure to get some.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V150]
I have affection for you too, Master, so I thought it was only right I give you this kind of chocolate as well.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V160]
I got it at a chocolate specialty shop that Ms. Luvia frequents, so I can guarantee it tastes yummy.[wait tVoice]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V170]
So...that just leaves this one last thing...[wait tVoice]

＠Miyu

...Yes. This, I heard from Illya.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V190]
For people you have deep affection for...[sr]People you care for from the bottom of your heart...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V200]
And people whom you'd like to have a special relationship with... She said you're supposed to give them true love chocolate.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V210]
So I...I...[sr]Um, this is very embarrassing to say, but...[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V220]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_77 0.1]

＠Miyu

I gave true love chocolate to Illya.[wait tVoice]

I said, I gave true love chocolate to Illya.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V250]
I gathered the finest ingredients from all over the world, employed every bit of my knowledge, skills, passion...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V260]
...and just a little bit of divine child power,[sr]to make the ultimate chocolate cake![wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V270]
But...when I showed it too Illya, all she said was:[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V280]
“This is too much”...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V290]
And she was right. I was so focused on the cake's taste and appearance that I forgot all about its calories.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V300]
There was no way Illya could have eaten it all by herself, so of course she refused to accept it.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Miyu
[tVoice ValVoice_504100 0_V310]
So, I'm sorry to ask you under those circumstances,[sr]but would you be willing to accept all of this together?[wait tVoice]

I know the names we give this chocolate change depending on the relationship, but for me, there isn't much difference between them.[wait tVoice]
