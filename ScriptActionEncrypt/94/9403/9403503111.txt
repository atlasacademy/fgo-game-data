...I know they say great heroes are fond of the pleasures of the flesh, but that many concubines? It's no wonder some people think he's a maniac...

＠Overlapping Whispers
What are the people of Japan supposed to think with a lecherous shogun like that leading them? If only he would devote half as much energy to governing as he does to the bedroom...

What's wrong with having lots of children? I was taught that children are our greatest treasure, that the more children I have, the safer our family's future is. I'm just putting that into practice.
[k]

＠
So why do they all speak of me with such disdain? Why do they go around calling me the Lecherous Shogun, or worse?
[k]

＠Sweet Female Voice
You haven't done anything wrong. Children are power. Having many of them is far better than letting your bloodline die.
[k]

＠Sweet Female Voice
I love your desire to have many descendants.
[k]

＠Sweet Female Voice
I can give you as many concubines as you like. If you tire of one, there will always be someone new to take her place.
[k]

＠Sweet Female Voice
Now come, let's go to the Ooku.
[k]

＠Sweet Female Voice
You can stay there as long as you like, whenever you like. For the Ooku exists solely for you...

Yes, dying is painful and scary,[sr]and I am terrified of it...

＠Scheherazade
But...I also have other thoughts, feelings,[sr]and wishes that are precious to me.

And I am just as scared of losing[sr]them...as I am of losing my life.

I wonder what manner of tantalizing climax[sr]Kama has in store for us there...?
