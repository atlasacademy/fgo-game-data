Shikibu. I don't have enough energy to bother sitting up right now, so I'm just going to lay down while we talk. But let me ask you this:
[k]

＠Andersen
Why would this book want to eat a letter?
[k]

＠Andersen
These Cursed Book monsters haven't had any problem defending themselves, but I've never seen one go out of their way to attack anyone.
[k]

＠Andersen
There's got to be some connection here.

So we've got your letter.[sr]The Cursed Book.

[charaFace E 4]

So all the books I have created are sensitive to feelings as well...
[k]

Master. What's the main thing you know about the Cursed Books?
[k]

？1：They feed on nearby information.
？2：They feed on nearby magical energy.

？！

＠Andersen
Right. They consume both nearby information,[sr]and nearby magical energy.
[k]

＠Andersen
But they don't do so indiscriminately.[sr]There's a condition that needs to be met first.
[k]

＠Andersen
To borrow Shikibu's words...the Cursed Books focus on information laden with emotion as well as magical energy.
[k]

＠Andersen
The former explains why one ate her letter,[sr]and the latter explains...
[k]

？1：The Valentine's chocolate resources!

？！

[charaFace G 1]
＠Andersen
Exactly.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Andersen
Of course, that doesn't help us track down where the original Cursed Book is now, but at least it all makes sense.
[k]

＠Andersen
These Cursed Books may be a pain in the ass, but they're not going around eating anything and everything.
[k]

＠Andersen
So we don't have to worry about one eating, say, a Magical Reactor, or a Holy Grail, or even a Heroic Spirit's Spirit Core.
[k]

＠Andersen
Hell, compared to the other shit we've been through,[sr]this is hardly a blip on the radar.
[k]

So no one is really going to mind that you're[sr]worried about your precious letter or whatever.

What, are you one of those types who bares your soul in letters, but can't actually bring yourself to give them to the person they're meant for?

Ah well, it doesn't matter either way.[sr]Besides, it's a fitting story for Valentine's Day.
