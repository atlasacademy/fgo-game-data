It's natural for one's emotions to run high after battle, but a quiet cup of tea does wonders.

Furthermore, those who live by the sword are also often expected to be cultured. My own education in the ways of tea was painful, but worthwhile.

Man, pirates really aren't cut out for navigating solid ground! It took way too long to get here!

Hmph. This is no laughing matter, Captain. We trusted you to lead the way because you said you're an expert map reader.

We never expected you to take[sr]us all the way to the ocean!

Oh well, at least I got a chance to see the seas of Japan for myself! Those distant seas with the great waves where those otherworldly octopuses live, no?

If not for your suggestion to “make a quick stop to check out those waves I hear,” we would have arrived long ago.

Do you have any idea how humiliating that is for one who once conquered an entire continent?

Could you ever face your advisors again if your legacy became that of “the little lost King of Conquerors”?

Well, it all ended just fine, Altera. Besides, we are no longer fighting a war. No need to overthink it.

＠Iskandar
Besides, I knew things would work out[sr]as long as Captain Drake was here.
[k]

＠Iskandar
She never stopped whistling and moving forward, after all, so I had every faith that we'd get here eventually!

[charaFace B 0]

＠Drake
You're right about that. And besides, you great kings have some real useful Noble Phantasms.
[k]

＠Drake
Yours is a flying chariot, right? If things had gotten bad, we could've just used that to find our way here.
[k]

＠Drake
That's what I was gonna do if it looked like your magical energy would run dry. After a swift kick in the ass to get you going again, of course.
[k]

＠Drake
I always had a firm grasp on the general direction,[sr]so I knew that flying would get us here in no time.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

'Course, that wouldn't've been any fun, so I didn't want to do that unless we found ourselves at the end of our rope.

See? I knew we had nothing to worry about! The captain here knows exactly what makes for a good adventure!

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...to come help us in the kitchen.

I knew you were all working hard to repair the Enma-tei, but I never stopped to think about what would happen when you were done...
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Of course we would need more hands in the kitchen to cook for more guests... I can't believe I failed to realize something so obvious...
[k]

？1：I'll be glad to help!
？2：If nothing else, I can at least peel veggies!

？！

＠Beni-Enma
I appreciate the sentiment...[wt 0.5][charaFace D 0]but I have to be honest.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Kiyohime and Tomoe won't be any help. For every dish they complete, chirp, they'd end up ruining two more.

If we can't show these new guests proper hospitality,[sr]I'll have to ask them all to leave.

It wouldn't be fair to only let in one or two.

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Come now, let's not be hasty. All we need is another Servant who can cook, right?
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
In that case, why don't we just recruit one from among these new guests?
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Why not explain the situation to them, and ask to hire them temporarily until the situation is in hand?

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
And if that doesn't work out...
