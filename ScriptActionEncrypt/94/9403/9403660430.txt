＠Shakespeare
Oho, a hearing, you say![sr]But alas, I lack an alibi!
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Hm? You're not here for that?[sr]You only want to know what I think about the piano?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Shakespeare
Hahaha, the piano had yet to be invented back in my time, but its beautiful tones are more than enough to set my flames of passion ablaze!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Shakespeare
Hm? Does that mean I wished to keep it all for myself then? An excellent question! Permit me to respond!
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Shakespeare
If one should come across a glittering pile of gold, it is only natural that one would want to keep it all for one's self. Why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal!

You want to hear what happened when I discovered the pianist was gone? Well, I can tell you that Shakespeare was already there when I arrived.

[charaFace D 1]

＠M
If it was anyone, I daresay it's him! What's that?[sr]Try to just answer questions and not hurl accusations?
[k]


＠M
Hahaha, you'll have to forgive me. It's something of a defense mechanism we older types develop. The moment it seems we're about to take the blame for something, we automatically try to pin it on someone else!

So you have come to question me as well? I fail to see what motive I could have for abducting a musician.

This is not about that? I see...

[charaFace E 4]

＠Queen
Yes, it was M who introduced me to the pianist.[sr]I remember that quite clearly.

I'll relay all my thoughts to you through my magical circuits. Let me know when you've sorted through all the aspects my subconscious mind focused on.

？1：I didn't know that was even a thing you could do!
？2：Talk about convenient!

？！

Hehe, I've always been good at[sr]these sorts of delicate operations.

Man, I guess even becoming a Heroic Spirit did[sr]nothing to temper your penchant for realism...

Master, I've finished my analysis. Your keywords are:[sr]forgetfulness, ghost, and Pseudo-Servant.

＠Reines
Forgetfulness, ghost, and...Pseudo-Servant?[sr]Why would those be lumped together?
[k]

＠Reines
I mean, I know that Servants are technically dead people, but there's a huge difference between normal dead people and Heroic Spirits.

＠Reines
Hey, pupil. When you think of a musician Heroic[sr]Spirit, who's the first person that comes to mind?
[k]

？1：I'd say Mozart.

＠Reines
Mozart... Yeah, that makes sense. He's certainly[sr]one of the most famous musicians in all of history.
[k]

？2：I'd say Salieri.

[charaFace A 5]

＠Reines
Salieri... He's a great musician, sure,[sr]but why would he be your first choice?
[k]

？！

Hmm... The question is, why did you think of that[sr]back then, out of all the other possible choices?

I've got it. Come with me, pupil!
