I don't know what sort of history you two have,[sr]but I do know what your skills are like now!

You both pass!

If you wish to study under me that badly, go ahead![sr]I'll have you in fighting shape in no time!

Now hurry up and put on an apron,[sr]then come with me! Chirp chirp!

(Sigh) I was hoping to keep you in a purely assistive role, but I guess that ship has sailed.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Go ahead and get that apron on. It looks like you and I will both be getting some supplementary lessons.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Tamamo Cat
Really!? I get to have personal instruction from Madam Beni herself!? Okay, I'm willing to split this carrot!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Tamamo Cat
But don't misunderstand me. I'm only doing this[sr]to help her. You're just...kinda here too.
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
And don't be surprised if you lose your shrine maiden gig to me after I up my game.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Yes, yes, I know. We already told you that you would only be doing this to help the Enma-tei, but never mind that now.

Hmm, it would seem we now have the kitchen situation under control. In that case, I believe our time would best be spent elsewhere.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
We'll need to gather at least three times the usual ingredients in order to feed all these new guests.

Come on, Senpai. The kitchen will be in good hands with Madam Beni-Enma and the Tamamos, so let's go make sure they have enough food to cook!
[k]

？1：All right, let's do this!

？2：Say, Fionn, who was the other Servant you had in mind, anyway?

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Diarmuid said it too, did he not?[sr]The ways of tea, I think he called it?
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Our countries may differ, but the principles are the same. Warriors need culture just as much as anyone. And by my nature, I'm rather good at most things.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
I was also good at dressing fish and filleting meat.[sr]If I wasn't, I would not be tied to feats of wisdom.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Still...I didn't exactly want to go around boasting about my cooking skills.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
My teacher was originally supposed to acquire them,[sr]but I ended up taking them for myself.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
I was told not to worry about it,[sr]but it's still one of my regrets.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Which is why I've been trying not to[sr]cook around others as much as possible.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
That said, if the madam still needed our help, I would have been happy to don my old chef's hat once again.
