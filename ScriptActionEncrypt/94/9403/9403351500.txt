There is something you wish to say to the great god-king Ozymandias, is there not? Very well. You may speak.[wait tVoice]

？1：You honor me, O Pharaoh.

Nitocris has told me it is a custom of modern society. I am surprised to see how much she has come to enjoy this world.[wait tVoice]

Have you been to see her yet? If you have not, you should do so later.[wait tVoice]

She said she has prepared a gift for myself, but I am sure she has also done the same for you.[wait tVoice]

That is just what sort of person she is. Even as the embodiment of the heavens, she remains distinctly human.[wait tVoice]

＠Ozymandias

She should be aloof, not caring! Just as the gods are a reflection of this world, so too are the pharaohs![wait tVoice]

But I would not call him a pharaoh so much as...[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_401200 0_V180]
No, I will not say anything more. I stand above all other pharaohs. That is enough for me.[wait tVoice]

＠Ozymandias
[tVoice ValVoice_401200 0_V190]
Nitocris and Cleopatra are fine as they are, too. It must be difficult for any who are not I to remain as pharaoh.[wait tVoice]

＠Ozymandias

During that war, I faced off with two heroes within my temple's innermost chamber! Well, technically it was three heroes, but for now, let us say it was two![wait tVoice]

＠Ozymandias
[tVoice ValVoice_401200 0_V340]
One was a knight of azure and silver who wielded the sacred sword of his time! The other, a great archer from the East who wielded a brilliant red bow![wait tVoice]

At that time, I released a pack of Sphinxes upon my enemies. One Sphinx was a royal species used to command the others...[wait tVoice]

＠Ozymandias

？2：How does a Noble Phantasm have offspring?

？！

＠Ozymandias
[tVoice ValVoice_401200 0_V400]
Nothing on earth is beyond Pharaoh's grasp! All of creation is at my command![wait tVoice]

＠Ozymandias

Of course, they are not Wehem Mesut's actual offspring. You may think of them as clones infused with my magical energy.[wait tVoice]

Care for them, and raise them well.[sr]I permit you to do so.[wait tVoice]
