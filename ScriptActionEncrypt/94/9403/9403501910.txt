Easy does it, Master.[sr]The only thing unsteady here is you.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mata Hari
I guess I'll just have to lead you by the hand myself.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
Don't be afraid to hold onto me if you[sr]need help keeping your balance, okay?
[k]

？1：I hate to be a bother, but thank you.
？2：I'm sorry to put you out like this.
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mata Hari
Don't worry about it. I'm genuinely happy to help.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Mata Hari
Usually, whenever I lean or press up[sr]against you to try and tempt you...
[k]

＠Mata Hari
...you just get an embarrassed look on your face and make an excuse to run away.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Mata Hari
So it's a really nice change of pace[sr]to have you depend on me so fully!
[k]

＠Mata Hari
Sure, you wouldn't be this helpless if I hadn't intoxicated you in the first place, but who cares!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Mata Hari
Okay, here comes a widdle obstacle! Ready to step over[sr]it? ...You did it! What a big [&boy:girl] you are![sr]Yes you are!
[k]

？1：(What's with the baby talk?)
？2：(I wish I could just curl up in her arms and forget everything else.)

Oh? Hehe, I know what that look means, Kiara.[sr]You're jealous, aren't you?

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Am I so transparent?[sr]Yes, I admit I am jealous.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Despite being a Servant, I don't usually[sr]have many chances to be of help...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
So, seeing Master relying on you like that, well... I confess it got me thinking about all kinds of silly things...
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
...like what it might be like for [&him:her] to drown in[sr]me...desire me[line 2]er, depend on me so thoroughly... Oh, I'm so embarrassed...
[k]

I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I can kind of tell you're...frustrated. Want to trade?

＠Sessyoin Kiara
...No, I think it best that I decline.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
I'm sworn to a life of abstinence right now, and am enjoying the novelty of the accompanying bondage that entails.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
Besides, when the time to seduce [&him:her] does come,[sr]all that patient waiting will have been wasted if I do not tend to that delightful task personally, with no assistance.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
I would hate to be swept up in this[sr]place's allure and break my vow.

＠Mata Hari
(Yikes, I just got chills down my spine... Did I misread her? Is Kiara actually more of a Tamamo type?)

...maybe we need to go down the path where you can smell the alcohol before you even set foot in it.

Let's hurry back and find another way,[sr]before [&Lord:Lady] [%1] starts acting even stranger!
