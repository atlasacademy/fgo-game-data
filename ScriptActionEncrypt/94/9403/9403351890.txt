...So, it's not a blessing from either the gods or my mentor, but a pure expression of Master's affections...[wait tVoice]

I can't believe it...![sr]Master, please, let me ask you something.[wait tVoice]

＠Arjuna

True, I am confident that I am superior to other Servants...[wait tVoice]

A true Servant should serve as your partner, and pull you towards a better path...[wait tVoice]

And yet, you still saw fit to give me chocolate out of affection... Very well, it seems I have no choice but to steel my resolve.[wait tVoice]

I must find the best, most fitting gift I can possibly give to...[wait tVoice]

Karna is my life-long rival. He is the hero I have loathed, begrudged, and above all...envied.[wait tVoice]

＠Arjuna

And this...is the arrow that killed him.[wait tVoice]

Now that you have seen fit to gift me with your trust and respect, the only worthy gift I can give you in return is my entire being.[wait tVoice]

...For me, this arrow is the shameful past...the grudge...that I struggle to make peace with to this day.[wait tVoice]

By leaving it in your care...I can reveal all there is to know about me to you.[wait tVoice]

At the same time, I can promise you this: I will never again loose such a cowardly arrow, no matter what.[wait tVoice]
