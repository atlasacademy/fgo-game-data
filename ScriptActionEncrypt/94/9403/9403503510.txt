Hey guys. Welcome back.
[k]

＠Kama
It sure took you long enough...[sr]Did you finally come to your senses?
[k]

＠Kama
You must have realized by now that no one will ever love you more than I will. Even if I do it grudgingly.

So the one Servant of yours who had any[sr]chance of defeating me is now dead...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Kama
...and your two little buddies are all the backup you brought? And here I didn't think you had a sense of humor.
[k]

＠Kama
Or did you genuinely realize how wonderful my love is, and you're all here to give up and experience bliss in eternal depravity?

Only two of us, you said? Now THAT is funny. Have you really failed to realize that we are not the only new arrivals here?

＠Sion
The fact that we are here now means that all of our cumulative knowledge leading up to this moment[line 2]the knowledge that makes us who we are[line 2]has grown as well.
[k]

＠Sion
Our technology...our knowledge...encompasses everything the Atlas Institute has amassed over thousands of years.
[k]

＠Sion
Now, we are going to turn that knowledge into[sr]primordial fire, and use it to drive off a Beast.[sr][wt 0.9][charaFace C 2][%1]!
