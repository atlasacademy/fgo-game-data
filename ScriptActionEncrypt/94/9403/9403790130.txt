...I never thought we would get wiped out while collecting Embers. I'm disappointed in our performance...
[k]

？1：It would've been instant death[csr]if my Command Spell hadn't had three strokes...
？2：And I saw a weird vision right before we got obliterated...

Yeah, I see you guys went through a lot.

＠Da Vinci
We've restrained Elisabeth for the time being.[sr]She's quite frazzled and a bit...deranged.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Also she keeps muttering a lot of nonsense.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Da Vinci
She's even talking about me. Something about me either “having one or not having one...”

We really shouldn't worry about what Elisabeth says. None of it is relevant anyway.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Anyway, we finished counseling Elisabeth.[sr]To summarize our findings...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Da Vinci
She says she's on the verge of getting into a relationship with some woman close to her...or rather, that she needs to be in one.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Da Vinci
She seems to have been overcome[sr]with some kind of obsession.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This is no mere misunderstanding or simple suggestion. It's the work of some kind of annoying mental indoctrination, in magecraft terms.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Da Vinci
In other words, she's been brainwashed.

Elisabeth claims she read a strange manga she picked up in the hall right before you all left to collect Embers.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She said it was a story set in Chaldea, featuring characters that look just like us.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Apparently its subject matter is pretty risqué. There's a lot of nudity and, um, intimacy. You know, that sort of thing.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's probably one of THOSE kind of doujins.

＠Da Vinci
Having read it, Elisabeth's mental state was twisted around by its magical powers...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Ultimately leading her to believe the relationships in the book are, in fact, real.
[k]

？1：Let's go find that book!
？2：We need to do something about it, stat!

？！

＠Da Vinci
Right. If we analyze and dispose of it,[sr]the brainwashing should stop!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Da Vinci
Let's get a move on![sr]Off to the hall where she found it!
