Hehe. What's wrong with pursuing[sr]your interests to their fullest?

＠Sweet Female Voice
As the shogun, you're the most powerful man in the land. Why should you be forced to waste your time thinking about things you'd rather not?
[k]

＠Sweet Female Voice
You have every right to spend your time how you see fit. I would never judge you for that.

I love the sound of your game[sr]pieces just as much as you do.

Oh, wait. I should dial down the confidence, shouldn't I? I don't want to come off as some kind of Pārvatī.

I should stick with my tried-and-true humble attitude. Let's try that one more time, shall we?

Aww, sorry. Maybe you didn't want to see me anymore, but here I am. It's okay, though. I still wanted to see you.

Anyway, congratulations on doing a[sr]killer job stealing the key from me.
