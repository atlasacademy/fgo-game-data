Don't sneak up on me like that. Why're you here, anyway? Were you drawn here by that strange presence, too?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：A wild Evil Goddess Ishtar has appeared!

[charaFace A 2]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V040]
Who're you calling an evil goddess!? I already apologized for that whole race thing, so it doesn't count anymore![wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V050]
Besides, aren't things kind of rough at Chaldea lately? I don't know where you get off calling ME an evil goddess...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V060]
Not when you've got that genuine article from who-knows-where hanging around. Just thinking about being lumped in with that thing gives me a headache...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V070]
I might be the goddess of Venus, but I still don't want anything to do with any sci-fi crap like tentacles or space octopuses.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V080]
Well, whatever. I'm enjoying a well-deserved break today, so I'm willing to let your usual digs slide.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V090]
So what brings you here, anyway? Just enjoying the sight of this weird upside-down castle?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：You know, a little sightseeing, a little chocolate receiving...
？2：Chocolate first. Sightseeing later.

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V100]
I see. Chocolate and sightseeing, huh. You're a greedy [&man:woman], trying to get both at once, [%1]☆[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V110]
This place does have a real World Heritage feel to it, so I totally get it. Hell, it even lured me here.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V120]
It's too bad there's no stores or souvenirs or treasuries here, though. All they've got are a bunch of doves and a chocolate fountain...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V130]
I mean, I know it's Valentine's and all, so it makes sense that chocolate would be the star of the show, but... Hm?[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V140]
Valentine's... Valentine's... So, you came here...where I am...to get chocolate...?[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V150]
Oh crap! Does this mean you wanted to get chocolate from me!?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：It sure does.
？2：I've given you plenty of tribute. Now it's my turn.

？！

[charaFace A 11]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V160]
(Ulp... There's no way I can tell [&him:her] I completely forgot Valentine's was today... Even if I really was an evil god, I can't play dumb when [&he:she] looks at me like that...)[wait tVoice]
[k]

[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V170]
(But I have to do SOMETHING to cover my ass...!)[wait tVoice]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V180]
(How would it look if it got out that the goddess of freaking beauty forgot about Valentine's!?)[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 15]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V190]
R-right, chocolate. I knew that. Of course I thought up something good for you. Why wouldn't I?[wait tVoice]

...Argh! I'm sorry, I can't do it! I'm just going to own up and apologize, [%1]! I'm really sorry![wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 18]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V240]
I didn't get you so much as chocolate chip![sr]I'm a complete failure of a goddess![wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Are you really Ishtar...?
？2：Did you just say “Sorry”!?

？！

[charaFace A 11]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V250]
W-well yeah. Even I know what an important day this is.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V260]
I know I ask a lot of you all the time, so it would ruin my goddess rep if I didn't at least pay you back now.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V270]
That's why I owned up and apologized for not getting you any chocolate ahead of time.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V280]
But...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V290]
...fortunately, the day is still young! I've got plenty of time to make up for my mistake![wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V300]
So on that note, hop on my scooter, [%1]![wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V310]
You said you wanted to go sightseeing, right? Then I'll take you to some of the best sights around![wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V320]
You should be honored, you know? It's not every day I kick Maanna into high gear for free.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_402600 0_V330]
Besides, if we travel around the world, we're bound to find some awesome chocolate sooner or later! Now come on, let's go looking![wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Oh geez, oh geez...!
？2：Wait! I need a helmet!
