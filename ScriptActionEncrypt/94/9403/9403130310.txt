Ooh, so this is it. Are you all ready?

＠Quetzalcoatl
Spirit, not strength, is most important to start a campaign. You must be mentally prepared to go to battle.

You can always get your body warmed up in battle,[sr]but there's no helping an unprepared mind, no!

I have a very good idea of your coaching skills now, thanks to all the training we've done.

I'm fighting to take back my stolen power, and Quetzalcoatl is fighting to take back her rightful Santa Claus power.

I don't think our opponents have the drive, or the NEED to win like us! Why, I bet they're just out to claim the Santa title on a whim!
