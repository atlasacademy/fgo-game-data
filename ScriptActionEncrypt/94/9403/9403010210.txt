Don't worry. We may not be that far from Oniland,[sr]but I promise the oni won't ever find us here.

Oniland appeared in front of the[sr]old Chitose Mine out of nowhere.

＠Sitonai
And as you've probably figured,[sr]the Great Oni is its ruler.

＠Sitonai
He possesses incredible power. In fact, he created most of Oniland's employees just by splitting off bits of his own magical energy.
[k]

＠Sitonai
And as long as his magical energy lasts, Oniland will keep growing larger and gaining more employees.

That's the danger he represents.

Not even his commanders[line 2]the big oni you saw back there[line 2]know his real identity.

What we do know is that he's a strange oni who dresses in jet-black and bloodred...

This is why Heroic Spirits are so much fun.[sr]They never fear oni, even though they're human.
