When I came to, I found myself[sr]on a beach I didn't recognize.
[k]

＠
No, it wasn't just the beach...[sr]I had never seen this country before at all.
[k]

＠
I pushed myself up to my feet. I ached all over,[sr]but at least my arms and legs still worked.
[k]

＠
I breathed into my hands to warm them up[sr]and tried to take stock of my situation.
[k]

＠
Yup, I'm definitely stranded.[sr]The waves must have washed me up here.
[k]

＠
It's weirdly cold. Is this the North Pole or something?[sr]As I wondered where I may have ended up...

I realized I didn't know who I was,[sr]or even what sort of Heroic Spirit I was.

All I remembered was my name, Elisabeth,[sr]and my dream to become an idol.
[k]


＠Old Fisherman
Heeey! Hey you!
[k]

＠Old Fisherman
What were you thinking, sleeping out here?[sr]You'll catch your death of cold.
[k]

＠Old Fisherman
Are you okay, missy?
[k]

＠Old Fisherman
You shouldn't be going swimming in the ocean now that it's almost autumn.
[k]

＠Old Fisherman
...Say, what's with those horns?
[k]

＠Old Fisherman
Is that what the kids call “cosplay”?[sr]Or is it some kind of newfangled fashion?
[k]

＠Old Fisherman
Looks pretty avant-garde.[sr]Or is “punk” more popular these days?
[k]

＠Old Fisherman
Haha, then again...
[k]

＠Old Fisherman
...maybe you're actually a real-life oni? Eh? Eh?
[k]


＠
That's what he called me.[sr]An oni.
[k]

＠
Oh, okay. Is that what I am? An oni?
[k]

＠
Aren't oni some kind of demon from the Far East?[sr]I guess if I look like one, that must be what I am.
[k]

＠
That's what I was thinking when[sr]I told him that yes, I was an oni.
[k]

＠
I did remember liking to bathe in blood,[sr]so I guess that makes me a blood-loving oni.
[k]

＠
As soon as I said that...the old man[sr]turned white as a ghost and ran away.

...The same thing happened in the mountains.
[k]

＠
After I left the beach, I walked and walked and walked until I ended up deep in the mountains.
[k]

＠
There, I met someone new. I thought I would finally have someone to talk to, but they ran away the second they saw me.
[k]

＠
They thought I was a man-eating oni and ran off, screaming about it.
[k]

＠
At first, everyone I met was really nice to me. They'd ask me what a young girl like me was doing here all by myself.
[k]

＠
But once I told them I was an oni who loved blood, they all just ran away. Some even threw rocks at me.
[k]

＠
Nobody stopped for me.[sr]Nobody turned back to look at me.
[k]

＠
I hate this. I don't want to be all alone.[sr]I like crowds and noise. I miss people.

I kept turning that over in my head[sr]as I walked along the mountain until...
[k]

＠
...What was that tunnel called again?[sr]The Seikan Tunnel?
[k]

＠
Anyway, I ended up in a really long, really dark tunnel.[sr]It was kind of claustrophobic, but I kept walking anyway.
[k]

Eventually, I found a huge expanse[sr]of land on the other side...

[k]

＠
I hated how cold it was. I hated freezing all alone.[sr]I hated being hit with stones.
[k]

＠
I hated that there was no one to talk to, that I was alone, and that everyone I encountered always ran away scared.
[k]

＠
I was sick of being mistaken for an oni.
[k]

But then...a voice spoke to me! Reached out to me!
