I suggest you use the winter clothes I packed for you, Master. You should find them at the bottom of your bag.

I heard Blackbeard grumbling about how there's nothing sadder than catching a cold on Christmas, so I wanted to make sure you were prepared for anything.

Of course, I made sure to pack[sr]a fluffy scarf for you too, Fou.

The Mexican team, of course!

I know that's the obvious choice...but there really is something about them that makes me feel stronger! They're like the sun god come to life!

True, true. But the Russian team seemed[sr]pretty tough too, don't you think?
