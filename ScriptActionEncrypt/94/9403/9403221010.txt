Chaldeans, we now have enough materials to reopen the hot springs, chirp. Would you care to try your hand at them?

Right... We did originally come here[sr]to rest and relax in hot springs...

But they've been closed all this time, so we've never gotten to see what they look like...

They're destroyed. It's a horrible sight to see, chirp. They've never been the same...
[k]

＠Sparrow
...after a wicked monster became intoxicated on alcohol, handsome men, and beautiful women, and started causing all sorts of havoc, chirp.
[k]

＠Sparrow
It took Madam Beni, chirp, as well as the entire Sparrow Squad to chase the monster away.
[k]

＠Sparrow
But it left nursing a powerful grudge, and its residual thoughts linger there as an evil force, refusing to let anyone else use the springs, chirp.

That monster is beyond your ability to defeat.[sr]Or perhaps I should say, to appease.

After all, hoho, such residual thoughts will never be satisfied and disappear unless it fights an opponent stronger than itself.

I'm afraid it's not that simple.[sr]This particular force is very, well, particular, you see.

It refuses to accept defeat unless its opponent is of the same class and uses the same weapon as it does. Otherwise, it will just say things like...
