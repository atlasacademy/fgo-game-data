We hope you will find it to your liking, chirp.

It would seem to be a bit larger than ours as well.

All right, that's enough of that, Kiyohime.[sr]We have a serious job to do here, remember?

Good, you're all here.[sr]It seems we were right to come this way, my lord.

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Indeed. We first thought we would go for a dip in these hot springs we've heard so much about...but sadly, they're closed right now.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
So instead, we decided to come here and figure out our strategy. It would seem there is more to this inn than meets the eye.

[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...but I think we should start with[sr]odd jobs, like Ms. Beni-Enma said.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
None of us are artisans, and we don't know[sr]the first thing about running an inn.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
So I say we start by finding tasks we[sr]know we can handle without a problem.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
That'll help us naturally get to know the inn's inner workings in terms of both layout and policies.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
As long as we do that, it won't be long before we know what we can do, and what we want to do.

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Very well then, I have a gift of my own to share.[sr]I spoke with some sparrows on our way here.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
I asked them if they had any jobs that needed to be done, and they told me something very interesting.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
The Enma-tei is run solely by Madam Beni-Enma and her nine apprentice sparrows, but they're currently shorthanded thanks to the demonic monkeys' mischief.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
I was further told that they have three specific jobs that require doing.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
First, procuring fresh, high-quality ingredients from the mountain and river.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Second, procuring lumber, as they use it[sr]for firewood, making repairs, and so on.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Third, chasing away the demonic monkeys,[sr]who have been up to no end of mischief as of late.
[k]

[charaFace H 1]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
So, what do you think? Doesn't that third one sound like something we could get started on right away?

That's perfect. As warriors, getting rid of demonic monkeys would be right up our alley.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
And since it was our own failings that brought about this precarious situation, it is only right that we fight ourselves to the bone, even without pay.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
One might even say this will bring a whole[sr]new meaning to the word...payback. Eh? Eh?

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Nonetheless, I like your spirit. Now then, if we're going to fight demonic monkeys, we should do so in the forest behind the inn.

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Master, feel free to command Diarmuid as you see fit.

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
That goes for me too, of course, since I'm partially to blame for the disturbance at the Tribute Hall.
