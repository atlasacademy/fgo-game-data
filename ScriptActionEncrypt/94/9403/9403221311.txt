I've never felt such pain and humiliation! No one but Lord Xiang Yu has ever made me cry out like this!

But you do feel better now, don't you? I still haven't gotten to your right shoulder. If you like, I can massage that as well for an additional charge.

Khh...![sr]Do it!

This is a good opportunity. If I'm going to fight as an accursed Servant myself from now on, I need to be tension-free from head to toe!
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
Do that, and you may have any treasure I possess!

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
There you have it; a new treasure won, and without any trouble. Even if that may only be due to our good fortune in having such a capable masseuse on hand.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
If it were a vicious creature we faced, I would have won the treasure in combat...but of course, this beautiful woman was nothing of the sort.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
At any rate, I am glad that this matter was resolved without bloodshed or hard feelings.

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Here, Master, why don't you hold on to this.[sr]It will be safer with you.

My stunning good looks inevitably draw attention from admirers and enemies alike, after all.

There's no telling what sort of mishaps[sr]may occur if I keep it with me.
