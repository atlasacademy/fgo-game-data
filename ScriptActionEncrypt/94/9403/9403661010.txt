＠Babbage
A fake Rhongomyniad that is somehow identical[sr]to the real one in everything but scale, hmm.
[k]

＠Babbage
I've also confirmed a vast number of automata and ghosts being discharged from its interior.
[k]

？1：So that's where they're coming from?
？2：Are they trying to conquer this Singularity for themselves?

？！

＠Babbage
Whoever is behind this must have given up on trying to handle this quietly now that El-Melloi II has revealed their true intentions regarding those slips of paper.

May I remind you that I only did so because it was an emergency? I would just as soon have remained hidden longer if I could have!

At any rate, approximately eighty percent of them appear to be making their way towards this particular patchwork.

＠Babbage
I imagine they want to capture [%1].

＠Astraea
My, my, whoever's behind this[sr]must really care for you.
[k]

？1：I'm counting my blessings.

＠Astraea
Whatever you may think won't change how they feel. I think I'm going to enjoy passing judgment on this quite a bit.
[k]

？2：You seem happy about this.

＠Astraea
Well of course. There's no room for judgment without strong feelings at play.

＠Babbage
On the upside, we now know where our enemy's hideout is, as I highly doubt it could be anywhere besides the inside of that lance.
[k]

＠Babbage
Thanks to our perceptions being altered, it never even occurred to us that that building could be anything but the Clock Tower.
[k]

＠Babbage
But now that it's sending out soldiers, the wool they were pulling over our eyes no longer does the trick.
[k]

＠Babbage
At least we can take heart in the fact that resorting to these double-edged measures is a sign that we've got our opponent on the ropes.

So how do you plan to respond to this, Steam King?

I suppose the easiest way to make certain your kingdom remains peaceful would be to send out [%1]...

No need to try and manipulate me, tactician. If I meant to take the easy way out, I would never have thought to collect the papers in the first place.

＠Babbage
I found a name that appears to have close ties to our[sr]mastermind in the files we reviewed. [bgm BGM_EVENT_81 0.1]It seems they are[sr]part of an organization called Chaldea.

[charaTalk E]

[charaFadein E 0.1 1]

＠El-Melloi II
...I knew it. We are up against someone from Chaldea. [sr]They could never have impersonated Mash otherwise.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
At the same time, the fact that they did so means[sr]they must have also betrayed Chaldea in some form.
[k]

[charaTalk D]

＠Babbage
Indeed. The next name I managed to extract is “Autonomic Observational Existence Verification System: Mnemosyne.”

[charaTalk C]
[charaFace C 5]
[charaFadein C 0.1 1]

＠Astraea
So there was a reason why that name[sr]was written on those scraps of paper.

[charaTalk D]

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Babbage
The conceptual designs behind Chaldea's systems are entirely different from my own, so I have yet to fully understand their inner workings.
[k]

＠Babbage
I might be able to make more progress on this if I had more time, but for now, this is the best I can do.

＠Reines
Regardless, the solution here couldn't be simpler.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Reines
With all the Servants we've got here, we should go pay this mastermind a visit and give them a good sock in the jaw.
[k]

＠Reines
Am I wrong, Lady Justice?

＠Astraea
I suppose not. All right, I'll help you. I expect this is why I was summoned here in the first place.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Astraea
But I should warn you: I doubt that even my power will be able to crack that spear's outer shell.
[k]

＠Astraea
That said, as long as we can make our way inside,[sr]I do think I can be useful. So, how do we get in?
[k]

[charaFadeout C 0.1]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 0]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Babbage
That is indeed the question. Astraea's power alone really won't be able to cut a swath through the sheer number of foes that guard the front entrance.

[bgm BGM_EVENT_62 0.1]

[charaFace E 1]

＠El-Melloi II
There are countless sources of magical energy scattered throughout Patchwork London waiting to be collected.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠El-Melloi II
Here's a simple question for you, Master.[sr]Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?
[k]

？1：The paper scraps!

？！


[charaFace E 1]


＠El-Melloi II
Correct! Unlike the Mnemosyne papers, the scraps don't seem as though they'll try to fabricate any false memories.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
Still, we can't be completely sure about that, so we'll need a Mystic Code to account for that possibility. Can we ask for your help with that, Steam King?
[k]

[charaFadeout E 0.1]

[charaTalk D]
[charaFace D 1]
[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Babbage
I should be able to make something like that right away. I've already been using those scraps as my own source of energy, after all.
[k]

＠Babbage
That said, one never knows what sort of trouble one might run into, so I will help you collect them as much as I can.
[k]

＠Reines
Then it's settled! Before the automaton and ghost army have a chance to attack us, we're going to collect as many scraps as we can, as fast as we can!
