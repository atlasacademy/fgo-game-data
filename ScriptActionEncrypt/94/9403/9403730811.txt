I beg your pardon?
[k]

＠Andersen
Like you said yourself, Murasaki's condition[sr]was an unfortunate accident.

＠Andersen
So since Moriarty didn't do anything wrong this time, you could just as easily have asked him, since he had to have been there too.
[k]

＠Andersen
I know you two are mortal enemies and everything, but in this specific instance, I don't think he has anything to hide.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]

＠Holmes
Were that the case, he should have brought up the portrait before we thought to investigate it.
[k]

＠Andersen
True, if he wanted filming to go smoothly, he should have mentioned the portrait being redone the first chance he got.
[k]

[charaFace H 5]

＠Holmes
I don't care for the way he holds onto information while snidely waiting to see what the rest of us do without it.
[k]

＠Holmes
Even if I called him out on it, he'd just claim it slipped his mind, and that would be that.
[k]

＠Andersen
I get how you feel, Holmes, but that still[sr]doesn't explain why you didn't ask him.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]

＠Holmes
Fair enough. I don't know if this[sr]will convince you, but here it is.
[k]

＠Holmes
I am a detective, so I believe I have an obligation[sr]to solve any mystery I come across.
[k]

＠Andersen
Don't know where that came from, but okay. I doubt there's any mystery you couldn't solve, but never mind that.
[k]

＠Holmes
However, there's a phase that takes place while learning about the mystery I'm about to solve.
[k]

＠Holmes
A phase where I examine all facts closely, free of preconceptions, and try to notice anything that seems out of place.
[k]

＠Holmes
In meticulously questioning everything, the relevant facts come to light, and the mystery reveals itself.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Andersen
Hmm. So you're saying your approach revolves around[sr]careful examination and questioning what you observe.
[k]

＠Holmes
Right. But on the flip side, it also means that one cannot engage with a case without such examination and attendant suspicion.
[k]

＠Holmes
And when it comes to preventing a detective from seeing matters clearly, and therefore suspecting them, there is no criminal more devious than James Moriarty.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Andersen
Wait, really? How does that work when him just being around makes anyone naturally suspicious?
[k]

[charaFace H 4]

＠Holmes
There is such a thing as being too suspicious, you see. It makes it difficult to determine how much one should suspect other things...
[k]

＠Holmes
...ultimately making it impossible to[sr]focus on the proper issues in a case.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]

＠Holmes
I'm certain the whole reason he was able to rule the underworld for so long is because he made sure to never be anywhere that would arouse suspicion.
[k]

＠Holmes
In nineteenth-century London, he would dispense his criminal schemes to others while erasing all trace of his presence from their surroundings.
[k]

＠Holmes
He ruled his network like a spider waiting in the middle of its web, all while remaining completely out of sight.
[k]

＠Holmes
If nothing else, it was an impressive feat. It even took me some time to be certain my suspicions were correct.
[k]

[charaFace H 4]

＠Holmes
...Not to mention a painful sacrifice.
[k]

I believe I have found a way to bring[sr]this movie to a satisfying conclusion.

Just give me...let's say thirty[sr]minutes to collect my thoughts.

＠Dr. Roman
Looks that way. After editing the footage we've got so far, I'd say we've got about an hour's worth of movie in the can.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So we need to find a way to end the story in about thirty minutes, no matter how many possibilities we leave on the cutting room floor.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
At least Sir Tristan looks like he has a good idea up his sleeve. He's a poet at heart, right?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So I think he'll come up with something[sr]that appeals to a wide audience.
[k]

？1：You're really enjoying this, aren't you, Doctor?

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Dr. Roman
Well of course! I've been monitoring[sr]the whole thing on my end, too!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I don't think I'm enjoying it quite as much as you,[sr]since you're the one actually filming everything...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...but I've still been having a blast watching the whole production from start to finish!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Dr. Roman
It is a shame that I haven't been able to see you in action, since all the footage is from your perspective...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Dr. Roman
...but I figure Mash can fill me in on that side of things once you all get back.

＠Dr. Roman
Still...the way things are going now,[sr]it might not all be smooth sailing.

Only if Sir Tristan's idea turns out to be something violent. No, I have a different concern.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I suspect the rest of the cast might[sr]be thinking along the same lines as him.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
From everything I've seen so far, they've all gotten really into their roles...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...so it's only natural that they'd all want their character to be the star of the show and come out on top.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I expect that's true for you too, Mash. Am I wrong?
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Are you secretly hoping that [%1] gets to enjoy the spotlight too?

＠Dr. Roman
Right? So the real work of resolving this Singularity is just beginning.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
[%1], I'm guessing it won't be long now before you have each actor speaking up with their own idea about how the film should end.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm sure they'll all be interesting in some way. Jeanne might even try bullying you into going with her ending.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But no matter how good they are, we can't use all of them. A movie can only have one ending, after all.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So as their Master, you're the one[sr]who's going to have to choose.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's no right or wrong answer for this movie, and I'm sure each actor's idea for the ending will have some core truth to it.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So I'd like you to think about what sort of movie you want to film before you make your decision.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That will be the answer to this Singularity...and I think satisfying the late director's spirit will also help us get a better reward.
