Ah...

＠Kingprotea
So, this means...I'm going to disappear, doesn't it...[sr]Now I'll never...get to go outside...

Still...

At least...you came all this way...[sr]You weren't afraid of me...

I hate my mother, but...my memories of her...are warm...
[k]

＠Kingprotea
All I wanted...was to touch someone...[sr]That's all I needed...to be fulfilled...
[k]

[charaFace B 7]
＠Kingprotea
Even though our contact was barely enough to satisfy[sr]my curiosity...I'm still glad I got to touch you.
[k]

＠Kingprotea
I'm so happy I met someone stronger than me.
[k]

[charaFace B 8]
＠Kingprotea
Hehe... The universe really is a big place, isn't it.[sr]Maybe this means...
[k]

＠Kingprotea
...I'll still get to be...a beautiful[sr]blushing bride...someda[line 2]

＠H. C. A.
About Kingprotea, you mean? It may not have been the happiest solution, but yes, it was the right one.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
That thing has no place in a digital world.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
In a world without physical limits, Protea has no way of escaping her own ego[line 2]her tṛ́ṣṇā.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
Buddhism teaches that love is essentially[sr]a heart that never stops yearning.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
It is duṣkṛta, in which no matter how much you eat,[sr]how fulfilled you feel, or how much you grow...
[k]

＠H. C. A.
...it will always leave you wanting more.[sr]Such longing is a black hole for the mind.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
No matter how much love you give it, it will never truly be full. And so long as it is not full, the heart can never hope to grow.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
That Alter Ego can never hope to find salvation as long as she's in SE.RA.PH.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠H. C. A.
However, in a physical world, with firm laws[sr]and built-in limits, that's a different story.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
After all, once you've run out of food or can't grow anymore, that's proof that your cup runneth over.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
So if a certain Master with freakishly weird taste decided to try summoning that monster just for kicks...
[k]

＠H. C. A.
Who knows? [&He:She] might just miraculously succeed at[sr]saving her without changing her monstrous nature.

Anyway, now that Kingprotea is gone, the gravitational fluctuations have followed suit. This little side story has officially come to an end, [%1].
[k]

＠H. C. A.
It's time for you to get back to the main plot.[sr]Go laugh that ridiculous cyber city out of existence!
[k]

？1：...I'll do my best!

？2：Aren't you gonna help me, electronic fairy?

[charaFace A 1]
＠H. C. A.
Didn't I already tell you? I don't do hard labor. I mean, just look at me. My claim to fame is writing fairy tales.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
I'd need to make the story a whole lot more exciting before I could show my face in the epilogue!
[k]

＠H. C. A.
So I'll sit this one out and let you guys handle it. If I showed up now, I'd end up making the ending one big anticlimax.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
Believe me, I have every confidence I'd take the wind out of that cow's sails with my sweet nothings!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠H. C. A.
That said, there's no way she'd be satisfied with only dying off once.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
She'd just come right back to life, and I'd have to destroy her all over again. It wouldn't actually resolve anything.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠H. C. A.
No, the only kind of person who can really break her spirit is a fool like you, not a twisted guy like me.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
Of course, if you try to face her directly, she'll probably just wipe you all out, but I'm sure you can figure a way around that if you put your mind to it.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
So once this is all wrapped up...make sure you tell the other version of me all about this someday. It'll give him a good laugh.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
Consider that my reward for showing you the way here. Now go out there and win one for the fairy!
[k]
