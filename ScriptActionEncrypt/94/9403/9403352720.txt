Oh, so you are here too, Cas[line 2]Fou. Are you here as a bodyguard? How cheekily industrious of you.[wait tVoice]

Hmm. I told you to come alone, but I suppose Fou can be an exception. And it does seem as though you were not followed.[wait tVoice]

Well, no matter. That is all I had to say. Take them to your room and have them for your midnight snack.[wait tVoice]

These chocolates are not overly sweet, but six rounds should suffice to satisfy you. If they do not, feel free to receive more from other Servants.[wait tVoice]

？1：Don't worry, six rounds is way more than I need.
？2：I'm already one and done.

Be certain to savor them slowly, one at a time. This will be your only gift from me for the entire year, after all.[wait tVoice]
