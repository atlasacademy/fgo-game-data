That's right. It has up-to-date information on every last Jeanne. The normal one, the black-garbed one, the small one, the teenage one...even the ultra-rare yellow one that's only ever been seen in the wild once.[wait tVoice]

It contains everything you'd want to know about the life of Jeanne d'Arc. Her favorite foods, her most hated foods, her typical daily schedule... Everything you could possibly want. Truly a jewel of a periodical.[sr][twt 5.5]Sir Blackbeard did make a comment I didn't fully understand about it being too thin, [charaFadein B 0.2 -512,0][charaMove B -288,0 1.4]but never mind him. This was a passion project made for fans, by fans.[sr][twt 3.7]Sir Tesla assisted me in landing an interview with Heroine X for the back cover, while Lady Anne and Lady Mata Hari miraculously obtained the swimsuit cover photo by convincing Jeanne to wear one after they noticed her feeling distraught about not getting to go to the beach last year even though she had a swimsuit. [twt 5]Even the small Jeanne was thrilled by this masterpiece of a photo, saying, and I quote, “Is this what I'm going to look like when I grow up? It is? Yesss!”[line 2][wait tVoice]
