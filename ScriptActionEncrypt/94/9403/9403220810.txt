Heh, don't be ridiculous. What you should be thanking is my perfectly on-point propaganda.

＠Goredolf
It doesn't matter how good the service is if there aren't any customers to serve.
[k]

＠Goredolf
That's why I made sure to have every sparrow on break go out and spread the word with testimonials like:
[k]

＠Goredolf
“Staying at the Enma-tei helped me win the lottery!” and “Thanks to the Enma-tei, I got a huge promotion!”

Kawaraban flyers... I wonder if these remote[sr]places use them like we use social media?

＠Mash
Does that mean you contacted Chaldea and told all the Servants there about the Enma-tei, Director Goredolf?

W-well, more or less. Of course, I plan on asking Chaldea for help, I just haven't got around to it yet.
[k]

＠Goredolf
And, well, I'm sure the Servants are already quite busy, and we still don't know just how much magical energy the Wandering Sea has to spare!
[k]

＠Goredolf
So the only ones who should come here are those with so much time and energy on their hands they're in danger of disappearing from boredom!
[k]

＠Goredolf
In fact, they should only come if they manage to infer our predicament on their end and decide to send help even without us saying anything!
[k]

＠Goredolf
...

[charaFace C 10]

...Do you believe me?

My, my, I never knew Heroic Spirits were so ostentatious. Or perhaps I should say, fashionable?
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
The Divine Spirits that visit the Enma-tei only care about rest, so they're always fickle in appearance.

＠Moneyed Monkey
But these...Servants, was it?[sr]They all positively glow with power.

Some evil spirits try to stay here whether they're welcome or not so they can get their old power back.
