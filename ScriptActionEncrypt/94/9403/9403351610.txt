I have been searching for you, Master.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V020]
I know all there is to know about Valentine's Day now.[sr]Bedivere has told me all about it.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V030]
I can tell that all of Chaldea is brimming with energy. Festivals do have a way of enriching people's hearts.[wait tVoice]

Would it be all right with you if...I took part in this event as well?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Of course!

[charaFace A 0]

＠Altria
[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V050]
Very well. Then I shall do so.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：I'd be glad to have you join us, Your Majesty.

Master, you are not one of my retainers. Above all, it is only right to forego manners during a festival.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Altria
[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V070]
I say this to you now not as a king, nor as a knight...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Altria
[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V080]
...but as just another person enjoying a festival with which I am unfamiliar.[wait tVoice]
[k]


？！

...Happy Valentine's, Master.[wait tVoice]

I wish to bless you for your valiant efforts to save the world. You let me wield my sacred lance for a just cause, and for that, you have my gratitude.[wait tVoice]

This is for you.[sr]Please, accept this chocolate.[wait tVoice]

...Unfortunately, I cannot hand it over to you myself.[wait tVoice]

＠Altria
[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V130]
To tell the truth, it is not actually here. Do not misunderstand. It is all ready for you to accept...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Altria
[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V140]
...but it is not so easily carried around. ...I am afraid I got a bit carried away with its creation. Forgive me.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：No way...
？2：So we're talking some really, REALLY big chocolate!?

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Altria
[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V150]
Yes. Very astute of you, Master.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Altria
[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V160]
I thought that, if this chocolate is meant to be a reflection of one's feelings, I should put all my heart and soul into its creation.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Altria
[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V170]
So that is what I did. However, the resulting confection got a bit...out of hand.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V180]
For a while, I was uncertain as to whether I would be able to finish it in time...but fortunately, I succeeded.[wait tVoice]

The knights of the Round Table assisted me. Honestly, they had no need to do so, as I am no longer their lord...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Altria
[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V200]
...but I cannot deny that their help was invaluable.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Altria
[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V210]
Both in its creation, and its transport.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Altria
[tVoice ValVoice_302000 0_V220]
I am afraid it is so bulky that I have no choice but to bring it to your room. I will send some of the knights there once it is evening to do so.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：I can't wait.
？2：In that case, why don't we all eat it together?

...Good idea. I think that will make the knights very happy.[wait tVoice]

I, too, would like to enjoy this festival in a lively fashion.[wait tVoice]
