＠Beni-Enma
Pathetic.[sr]This is, chirp, absolutely pathetic, Tamamo.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
There's not a hint of spice in this entire meal.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
You may have covered the basic food groups, but it's the same boring meal everyone's seen before, chirp.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
You realized in the middle of cooking that you used ingredients your Master couldn't eat, so you took the ones set aside for tomorrow, am I right?
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Cheep cheep, I see you cut your ingredients smaller than usual. It's obvious you burned them because you couldn't tell when they were done.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
How shameful, thinking you know all there is about cooking as soon as you reach the intermediate level! This would never have happened if you had been more careful in the prep stage!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
A failure to manage ingredients before you even get to the cooking, chirp. In warfare terms, your army was routed because you failed to supply them properly!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Now every last one of your infinite imaginary future Masters that might have existed in parallel worlds has been slain! Chirp!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I can't believe it![sr]What have I done...!?

There's barely any color to these greens. You forgot to blanch them after boiling them, didn't you?
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Cheep, these yams and pumpkins are falling apart from being overcooked. And what were you thinking, cutting the vegetables into shapes? Trying to be cute?
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Most egregiously, you were supposed to cook fish for your assignment, but I see none!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
A parasite popped up while you were cleaning the fish, so you set the whole thing alight with your dragon flames, am I right? How many times must I tell you to leave your fire at the kitchen door?
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Beni-Enma
Chirp, if you are going to roast a fish,[sr]at least make sure to dress it properly first!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
As for seasoning, you can add them without measuring only once you're on the same level as Tamamo! You must measure your teaspoons and tablespoons properly!
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Y-[charaMoveReturn C 256,15 0.2]yes, ma'am...![sr]I promise to take your advice to horn[line 2]I mean, heart!

Reading the recipe in the middle of cooking... Using whatever's at hand to substitute missing seasonings...
[k]

Thinking you can just triple the cooking temperature[sr]to cook a ten-minute recipe in a third of the time...

Chirp! I haven't seen a student try so hard to[sr]create a fool's dish in a long time, Tomoe Gozen.

[charaFace A 2]

＠Beni-Enma
You will get no mercy from me whatsoever!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
These horns of the battlefield you prize[sr]so greatly have no place in the kitchen!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Tomoe Gozen
Huh!? I don't understand why you're so upset,[sr]but whatever it is, I'm very sorry!
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
I promise I will do better with the next dish![sr]Probably!
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
As long as I keep cooking, I am sure one[sr]of them will turn out well eventually!

I was hoping you would have improved somewhat, but it seems to have been a foolish thing to hope for.

It looks like you've been diligently applying yourself, Tamamo. Chirp, if nothing else, you can now more than hold your own in the kitchen.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I'll even give you full points for both taste and presentation. But be careful not to make it too fancy.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
That's just misusing your feelings. Love should be used as a spice, not the main course.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
The most important thing is to make sure[sr]your Master stays healthy, chirp chirp.

Kiyohime, your hands are so smooth. Do you hate washing them with cold winter water that much? Hm?

You can't shirk from water, fire dragon or not, chirp, if you're going to cook a meal full of love.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
There are plenty of great gloves these days, and the culinary arts never stop advancing. You should pay more attention to your tools.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Beni-Enma
Chirp chirp, you ARE as good with heat control as I expected. I'm glad to see you're improving yourself.

＠Tomoe Gozen
Please tell me, just how have[sr]I improved since we parted ways!?
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Beni-Enma
I wonder, where do you get all that confidence from? It's as though you see ingredients as little more than an enemy general to be vanquished.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Beni-Enma
Chirp, I'll be reteaching you everything from scratch later. I suppose we'll have to start by developing your palate...
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
The fact that your meals are so rough around[sr]the edges shows that your palate has become dull.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
The only flavors you can taste are from modern-day snack foods, am I right?
