There is one pillbox[line 2]or rather, one shogun's soul you did not find even after you made your way to the Ooku's final chamber.

That was certainly true for Ashikaga and Toyotomi.[sr]Ultimately, they all ended just the same.

I guess it really was too much to hope that the Tokugawa reign would be the only one to last forever...

...Let me just ask you this.[sr]What happens to Japan after Tokugawa is gone?

Does it go back to the turbulent way it was before, when the whole country was constantly at war?

Lord Ieyasu, Lord Hidetada, and Lord Iemitsu alike would surely say that as long as the world is at peace, that is all that matters. That is the kind of people they are.

＠Sion
Right. That is the crucial point. Tokugawa Yoshinobu abolished the Tokugawa shogunate of his own accord.
[k]

＠Sion
Which is to say that he ended the reign of the Tokugawa, clearly setting himself apart even from the other shogun.

At any rate, the fact that she chose to hide whatever is behind that wall must mean that she does not want you to find it.
