＠Restaurant Owner Medea
My mentor asked me to come over to this country and open a restaurant so I could spread the joys of kykeon.
[k]

＠Restaurant Owner Medea
Business was booming at first, but then another restaurant calling itself the Sparrow's Perch opened up nearby...
[k]

＠Restaurant Owner Medea
...and my sales have died down to practically nothing ever since...
[k]

？1：The Sparrow's Perch, huh... I've got a good feeling about the food there.

？2：I don't know why. Kykeon's yummy.

？！

＠Restaurant Owner Medea
I like to think I make a decent bowl, but the big thing working against kykeon is the lack of variety to it.

[charaFace B 4]

＠Restaurant Owner Medea
If a customer shows up asking for pork chops, or pizza, or pumpkin pie, all I can offer them is porridge...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Restaurant Owner Medea
So, on that note:[sr]You guys are the Chaldea clan now, right?
[k]

＠Restaurant Owner Medea
If I win, how about you sign a contract saying you'll buy kykeon from me on the regular to feed your army? Deal?
