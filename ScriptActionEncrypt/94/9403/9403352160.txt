What a coincidence, running into you on Valentine's Day like this. Unless, of course, it wasn't a coincidence?[wait tVoice]

That's right, it's a toy piano. It might not look like much, but you can actually play real music on it.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_501500 0_V110]
It's very well made right down to the interior, but that's not what makes it a great present.[wait tVoice]

＠Amadeus
[tVoice ValVoice_501500 0_V120]
Think about it. With this, I can play music for you whenever I come visit you![wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_501500 0_V130]
Sure, it might be lacking in keys, but I can easily cover for that with my mad skills. Go ahead and call on me whenever you feel like having sweet, sweet dreams.[wait tVoice]

Just don't request any requiems, or I might accidentally attract a certain pain-in-the-ass executioner![wait tVoice]
