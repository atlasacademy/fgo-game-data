The Cursed Book has been recovered! It doesn't have much magical energy, so I'm guessing[line 2]

Yes. It seems this was not the original Cursed Book. Fortunately, we can at least be certain that it was one with which the original shared its magical energy.

I apologize once again for all the trouble I've caused you, kind chefs.

Hahaha, if you think this is trouble, you obviously haven't been in many cafeterias! I'm still not sure what's going on here, but don't worry about us.

Compared to you-know-who seeing Nero's face and going wild, Salieri acting up, one of Phantom's episodes, or Berserkers you can't reason with...

＠Boudica
Well, let's just say we're used to things not always running smoothly around here.

For sure. There's pretty much always something on fire in the kitchen, figuratively and literally.

It's gonna take way more than a little flying book action to make us bat an eye.
