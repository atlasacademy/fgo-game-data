＠Kama
Since I love you all so much, I'm going[sr]to let you in on a little secret.
[k]

＠Kama
I knew you were going to find the last shogun and his Tokugawa-ending power. I planned for it from the beginning.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Kama
Seriously, if I really considered it a threat, don't you think I would have done a better job of hiding it?
[k]

＠Kama
I WANTED you to find it.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Kama
That's right. That thing you thought was the key to turning the tables on me is all part of my love.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Kama
You might ask, “But Kama, why would you do something like that?” Isn't it obvious?
[k]

[charaFace A 17]

＠Kama
Because there is nothing so delicious to me as the moment someone hits true rock bottom.
[k]

＠Kama
After all, there's no way to go from there but up, right? Hehe... It makes loving you worth sooo much more.
[k]

＠Kama
So please, keep going down. Don't stop at misfortune and unhappiness. Keep going all the way past despair.
[k]

＠Kama
And hey, Pārvatī?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Kama
You know how you can't use your Spirit Origin as freely as normal thanks to rescuing that human? And how you had to borrow that spear from Shiva just to have some way of fighting?
[k]

＠Kama
Well, I have a special present for you. I'm going to make your Spirit Origin even harder to use.

＠Kama
After the scales tipped to the right and their recoil gave me what I needed to manifest as the Beast of the Left...
[k]

＠Kama
...I searched all of humanity for[sr]just the right place and people.
[k]

＠Kama
A place that would let me drag[sr][%1] into depravity...
[k]

＠Kama
...and emerge as a complete, fully mature Left[line 2]the antithesis of the incomplete Right.
[k]

[charaFace A 17]

＠Kama
That was when I sensed it: the fixation[sr]of a certain woman on the verge of death.
[k]

＠Kama
It was a shriek of love loud enough for me to sense it...and powerful enough to drive a stake into the whole world.
[k]

？1：...?
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Kama
This woman spent the entirety of her tumultuous life dedicated to loving one, single thing.
[k]

＠Kama
All she wanted was for it to continue on properly.[sr]To grow up as it should.
[k]

＠Kama
Then, after she had fallen ill, in the last moments of her love-filled life...she struggled, like all humans do.
[k]

＠Kama
She struggled with the idea that the life that so contented her was about to end.
[k]

＠Kama
“Why now?” she thought. “It's not enough. I can't die yet. I'm still worried about what might happen.”
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_81 1.0]

“I still have so much love left to give to Tokugawa!”

I am the god of love, and the Beast of Lust. I chose that fixation because it was just so...comfortable for me.

It even came with a harem,[sr]perfect for trapping people in depravity.
