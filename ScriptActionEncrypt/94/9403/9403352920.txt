...Easy there, Master. Feel free to lower your guard. I have only just arrived at Chaldea, after all.[wait tVoice]

Why wouldn't I want to become better acquainted with my new Master?[wait tVoice]

Do not concern yourself with Chocoramis any longer.[wait tVoice]

That was nothing more than bit of dirt that I have now thoroughly cleansed from my Spirit Origin.[wait tVoice]

All right, I shall now bestow upon you my Valentine's chocolate.[wait tVoice]

But first, what about a riddle, to make things more interesting?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V070]
In your mind, what would you say my chocolate tastes like?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Well... Um...
？2：Something mind (and body) numbingly good...?
？！

I see. Poison, is it.[sr]Yes, you're right.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V090]
It is all too easy to imagine me presenting someone with poisoned chocolate.[wait tVoice]

However...[wait tVoice]

Have you forgotten that, as the world's oldest known poisoner...[wait tVoice]

...I also excel at betrayal?[wait tVoice]

Hehe. You may think these chocolates are poisoned, or even that they simply look poisonous...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V140]
...but in fact, they are exactly what they appear to be: an assortment of beautiful, traditional chocolates.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 11]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V150]
Now then, tell me: should I do something so callous as to fill these beautiful chocolates with poison?[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V160]
Of course not. And I would not.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V170]
Hehe, I must say they came out well, even for me...[sr]Would you mind if I had one?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Help yourself.

[charaFace A 5]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V180]
Is that any way to speak to an empress? See that you do not do so again.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V190]
But, for now, I will go ahead and choose...this one.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：Sure. Say “ahhh.”

[charaFace A 12]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V200]
Heh. Are you trying to embarrass me, and thus avoid trying them yourself?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V210]
Unfortunately for you, I am well accustomed to such intimate gestures.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V220]
Ahhh. Go on, give it to me.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V230]
Nom nom...nom...[sr]Mmm, delicious.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V240]
But of course, I did make it myself. For me, the best I can say is that it lives up to my expectations.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V250]
It is neither the height of deliciousness, nor does it send my mind into ecstasy.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V260]
How disappointingly plain, especially for one of my creations.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：I don't know if I'd call these “plain” exactly...
？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V270]
Is that so? Well, that pleases me.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V280]
Go on, now it is your turn to have one.[wait tVoice]

[se ade13]
[seVolume ade13 0 0.3]

？1：It is really good, but...
？2：It kind of...tingles?
？！

[charaFace A 9]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V290]
Ah, that would be the pufferfish poison. Tetrodoxin, as it is known in scientific circles.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：What!?
？！

[charaFace A 12]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V300]
Why so surprised? You are resistant to poison.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V310]
See for yourself. You are not even short of breath, no?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Maybe not, but still!
？2：Pufferfish poison is deadly stuff!
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V320]
Oh come now. I have every faith you would survive poison or environments more toxic than that of a pufferfish.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V330]
Besides, now I know something interesting.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V340]
It seems your resistance does not neutralize poison completely, but breaks it down to the fine line between flavor and toxin.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V350]
If it did not, you would have found my chocolate both tasteless and odorless.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V360]
Both nutrients and medicine can be poisonous depending on how they are used.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V370]
Flavor is no different.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V380]
I'm told there have been a great number of people who have hurried to their deaths, all because of the pufferfish's delectable tetrodotoxin.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V390]
But you need not fear such an end. You are free to indulge in poison's pleasures with me.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V400]
Hehe... Wonderful. Truly wonderful.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V410]
Go on then, keep eating.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V420]
That next chocolate contains the essence of a poisonous toadstool.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V430]
An ordinary human would be overcome with addiction symptoms such as nausea and confusion if they ate such a thing...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V440]
...but you, of course, are not normal.[sr]In which case...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Semiramis
[tVoice ValVoice_603200 0_V450]
...see how wonderful this poison tastes for yourself. It is a flavor you will never, ever forget.[wait tVoice]
