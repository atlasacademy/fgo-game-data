Given the highly suspect timing, I'm guessing the team you're up against next must have sent them.

Ow ow ow... I'm sorry I was so careless. Normally, I could handle opponents like that no problem, but I was still a little tired from having just fought a match.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Bradamante
But it's okay. I think I'll be fine before it's time for the next match! And even if I'm not, it would be unbecoming of a knight to complain!

...All right, I've made up my mind. If your next opponents are this unscrupulous, and you're starting at a disadvantage as well...

Effort alone won't solve this. And so...I'm going to teach you something I never intended to.

＠Martha
I'm not sure if you'll be able to use them,[sr]but I have to teach you all the same.

[charaFace G 2]

It's time for you to learn the fifty-two fighting styles I sealed away for being too dangerous!

My full fighting style has many different techniques. Unfortunately, some of them have...issues.
[k]

＠Martha
At any rate, we only have a single day for you to learn these styles before your next match.
[k]

＠Martha
I don't know how much they'll help you to counter their dirty tricks, plus the training will be hard and grueling...
[k]

＠Martha
I won't force you, but I think knowing these styles may help you in the fight ahead. So...what do you say?

No, I couldn't. There wouldn't be any point,[sr]since my styles would not mesh well with yours.

＠Martha
Besides, I think you already have everything you need.

After all, it's not as though you faces only know how to fight clean, right?

Wh-what are you saying? Of course I will.[sr]Now, would you please stop looking at me like that?

[charaFace G 5]

？！

＠Martha
Ahem. All right then, let's begin. Go ahead and get into the ring. And whatever you do, don't let your guard down.
[k]

＠Martha
My forbidden Fifty-Two Street Fighting Moves are all ultrapractical techniques meant to be used in live combat.
[k]

[charaFace G 2]
＠Martha
Come at me with anything less than your best,[sr]and you WILL end up on the mat!
