What's it like, having everyone fawn over you? Is it actually kind of a pain in the ass?[wait tVoice]

So, Master, I was wondering if you'd seen the Genji general anywhere?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
[tVoice ValVoice_602100 0_V080]
I'm pretty sure you're gonna have a baaad old time if she finds you, so you might want to watch your back.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
[tVoice ValVoice_602100 0_V090]
I'm not trying to scare you or anything, but one wrong answer, and she might just cut you in two on the spot...[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
[tVoice ValVoice_602100 0_V100]
I wouldn't put it past her, you know. Teeheehee, she really scares me. I mean, we're talking about an oni who goes around killing Ushi-Oni, right? Who knows what's going on in that head of hers?[wait tVoice]

Teehee. You know, there's something about this that makes me feel like I'm giving candy to a child.[wait tVoice]

＠Shuten-Douji
[tVoice ValVoice_602100 0_V150]
Then again, if I were to pat your head like a real child, I'd be no better than the Genji general, would I.[wait tVoice]

I don't know what's up with the brat. He did seem like he was running away from something earlier, though.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
[tVoice ValVoice_602100 0_V190]
I was thinking of finishing things up by getting him drunk, tying him down, and stuffing his mouth full of bon-bons myself, though.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
[tVoice ValVoice_602100 0_V200]
I wonder what he'd taste like if I ate him up afterwards? All that sugar might make his blood and flesh extra sweet...[wait tVoice]

＠Shuten-Douji
[tVoice ValVoice_602100 0_V210]
Ooh, that sounds nice.[sr]I might just have to try that sometime.[wait tVoice]
