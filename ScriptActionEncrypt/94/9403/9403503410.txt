Correct, but I am pretty sure they were atomized or broken down into the smallest possible components before being used to construct this place.

＠Sion
They were not physically bonded[sr]together or anything like that...

？！

[charaFace A 12]

＠Sion
Hehehe. Are you worried? Do not be!
[k]

＠Sion
Mash and I have been brimming with nervous energy ever since we lost our connection earlier.
[k]

＠Sion
At this point, there is nothing we cannot handle!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Sion
There is definitely something different about this place compared to the others. It is almost like a giant “Keep out!” sign.
[k]

＠Sion
But, after scanning it thoroughly,[sr]I can see that it has a small hole.
[k]

＠Sion
A hole with a very specific function.[sr]Namely, a keyhole.
[k]

？1：Really? I can't see anything like that...
？！

[charaFace A 14]

＠Sion
That is because it is a conceptual-slash-magecraft hole that has been hidden very cunningly. I am sure it is impossible to find with the naked eye.
[k]

＠Sion
It looks like this keyhole is designed to accommodate a long, thin catalyst, like a card.
[k]

＠Sion
And of course, that card would have to possess energy capable of interfacing with this Ooku, so[line 2]

Unlike the pillboxes, they do not seem as though they ever served any purpose.

If this attendant is like all the others who were carrying pillboxes that you've defeated...

...then she must be an anchor that[sr]Kama no longer has a use for.

I do not think attacking her, or removing her from the pillar, will have any effect on the Ooku itself.

It would have been a lucky break for us if we could damage the Ooku by fighting her...but never mind that.

Our goal right now is to acquire Lord Yoshinobu's pillbox. If you have to take her out to get it, then do so!
