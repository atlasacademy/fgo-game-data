I would've ignored the whole thing if I could have, but I'm still technically your Servant.[wait tVoice]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V050]
So I went out of my way to play along with this silly event. What's wrong with that?[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V080]
Fine then. If you're going to mope about it that much, I'll stay with you just a little longer. It is Valentine's Day after all, right?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V090]
So what were you hoping for? Sweet nothings? A passionate embrace?[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V100]
Go on then, tell me what you want.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 10]
＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V110]
Whatever it is...I'll make sure to do the exact opposite.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V120]
I'm Meltryllis, the Alter Ego of pleasure. There's no one in the whole universe better than me at turning lovers into very literal puddles.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V130]
There's no way you can escape becoming my prisoner. You're doomed to drown in your own pleasure.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V140]
So, you want me to melt you into jelly? Is that it, [%1]?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：(Oh crap. I don't like where this is heading...!)
？2：C-can you tell me more about your chocolate!?

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V150]
Huh? You'd rather hear about the chocolate?[sr]...Well, okay.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V160]
You know, I never liked Valentine's much to begin with. There's just nothing beautiful about chocolate.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V170]
Dark chocolate, white chocolate, it's all just solids and simple flavors. You might as well be playing with clay.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V180]
In fact, clay might even be better! At least with that, it's possible to make sculptures and figurines![wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V190]
But with chocolate, all you get is chocolate hearts, chocolate bars, chocolate cake, and maybe a little chocolate cube ice cream if you're feeling fancy.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V200]
Ugh, sucrose-addlepated idiots, the lot of them. You'd think they had nothing but sugar for brains![wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V210]
It's like they're not even trying! This is supposed to be a gift for your lover, right!?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V220]
Aren't you supposed to do something no one else can possibly do? Something that condenses who you are down to the utmost degree!?[wait tVoice]

...Hmph. I can see you pleading with your eyes for me to calm down.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V240]
Don't worry, I am calm.[sr]Cool as a cucumber, as they say.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V250]
If you don't believe me, look at my chocolate. It looks, feels, and sparkles just like a beautiful transparent crystal.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V260]
I made the ice wafer exterior by freezing hundred year old mineral water. Thank goodness Chaldea is on top of a snowy mountain.[wait tVoice]

The filling is pure manuka honey, a rare nectar that can only be harvested from flowers that bloom in valleys exactly two-thousand meters deep.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V280]
Well? I took honey that only a select few can ever hope to see, much less taste, and added my own, personal touch.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V290]
...And by personal touch, I mean my virus. I'd say it ended up as three parts natural honey, seven parts virus.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：I knew there had to be a catch...
？2：Wouldn't that mean I'd die if I ate it?

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V300]
Yes, I suppose it would. You don't even have the Magic Resistance of a third-rate mage, so if you ate it straight, you'd probably be dead before you finished your first bite.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V310]
But isn't that what toxic love is all about? If you weren't prepared to die, you shouldn't have formed a contract with me.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：I'd be okay being melted down by you.

[charaFace A 6]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V320]
Well, well, listen to you, [%1]. I guess all my training has finally paid off.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V330]
But I wonder, how long will you actually last?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V340]
There's more to my poison than just pain and pleasure, you know.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V350]
Watching yourself dissolve into something else is nothing less than sheer terror.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V360]
For your sake, I only hope you don't embarrass yourself by breaking down crying and begging for help.[wait tVoice]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V440]
Oh, and don't worry, that chocolate won't really kill you. It'll just blow your mind from sheer deliciousness.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V450]
I was only acting out a fantasy. One where I give someone a treat with enough passion to kill them, and [&he:she] eats it even though [&he:she] knows [&he:she] might die.[wait tVoice]

Listen to me. This should go without saying, but not accepting it is unacceptable.[wait tVoice]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V510]
...Yes, I used my poison to make it, but I also made sure to take out all the Drain ingredients. Of course I did.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
[tVoice ValVoice_1000200 0_V520]
It won't kill you, it'll just blow your mind from sheer deliciousness. Though I won't deny it is incredibly addictive.[wait tVoice]

It's okay to accept a gift from Lip, but I wouldn't accept one from BB if I were you.[wait tVoice]
