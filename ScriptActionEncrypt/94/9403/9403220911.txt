I'm sorry, Ms. Beni-Enma... I'm afraid I don't remember much of what you taught us...

＠Mash
But, strangely enough, I also feel like...I'm not so scared of cooking anymore?
[k]

＠Mash
Or maybe I should say, I feel like I don't have time to be scared about it...

Chirp. I recall Tamamo saying the same thing. A common thread among those who are no longer beginners.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
All you have to do now is find[sr]a curriculum that works for you.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
If you still want to improve your skills after all of this, come back to Jigoku Kitchen whenever you like.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I have eight courses in total, chirp. And they weren't named after the Eight Hot Hells for nothing!

I'm sorry if I made you worry, Senpai.[sr]If it makes you feel any better, I really did learn a lot.
[k]

？2：Why did you sign up for this cooking class, anyway?

[charaFace A 3]

＠Mash
W-well...because I wanted to make something yummy for you, like Boudica always does...

It's okay, Mash. You'll make a great wife someday.

＠Beni-Enma
I wasn't good at cooking when I first started, either. It took me a long time before I could make something I was comfortable serving.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
It's very difficult to make something delicious when you're just cooking for yourself, cheep.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
But when you have someone to cook for,[sr]well, then it's a different story.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Just picturing their face smiling in delight after tasting your food is enough to make it come out well.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Beni-Enma
Then there's no need to worry! All you have to do now is work hard, make mistakes, and learn from them!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Chirp! And since you already know exactly who you want to cook for, you're already on your way!
