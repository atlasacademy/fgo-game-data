Ah, there you are.[wait tVoice]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V020]
Here. You can have this, if you want.[wait tVoice]

？1：Thank you!
？！

I don't know why you're so ridiculously happy about this. It's only courtesy chocolate. This is just something we have to do today, right?[wait tVoice]

I just grabbed the first thing I happened to see at the store. It's no big deal. I'm just being polite.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：But, you obviously wrapped this by hand...
？！

W-well excuse me for being a bad gift-wrapper! You've got a lot of nerve, complaining about a tiny thing like that![wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 11]


＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V070]
Yeah, I wrapped it myself. I didn't have anything better to do, seeing as I'm immortal and all![wait tVoice]
[k]


＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V080]
Time's the one thing I've got more than enough of to spare! I'm so bored I'll do damn near anything to kill it![wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：So, does this mean you've given a valentine to someone every year?
？2：I always thought you avoided anything that had to do with people...

Ugh, you really do just say whatever pops into your head, don't you... Aren't you afraid of me?[wait tVoice]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V110]
Do you go around talking to Carmilla or Vlad like that, too?[wait tVoice]
[k]


？1：You're not really as scary as them.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V130]
Yeah, maybe you're right. Some people have thought I was a vampire, but I'll be damned if they start lumping me in with the real deal.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Do you not get along with Carmilla?
？！

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_77 0.8]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V140]
That's one way of putting it.[sr]Another would be that I hate her damn guts.[wait tVoice]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_11 0.1]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V150]
I know she's changed from how she's supposed to be thanks to all the rumors humans spread about her...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V160]
...but that's just one of the things I hate about vampires like her. I don't know about anyone else...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V170]
...but I sure as hell don't have any desire to drink blood, and there's no way I'm letting anyone think otherwise.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：You don't?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V180]
Sure, I need to replenish my life force now that I've been forced to incarnate into this living vessel...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V190]
...but I can make do just fine as long as there's fauna or flora nearby to share a bit of their energy with me.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V200]
As long as I don't end up in the middle of a desert somewhere, I'll pretty much never go hungry.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V210]
Not to mention just the thought of drinking blood for the taste makes me sick.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：So, you're not an enemy of humanity then?
？！

[charaFace A 2]


＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V220]
Huh? The hell are you talking about?[sr]If anything, you humans are MY natural enemy.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V230]
You have no idea what I've been through just for having a body that won't die.[wait tVoice]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V240]
You humans are incapable of tolerating anything beyond your understanding.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V250]
You're fundamentally incapable of leaving Mystics unexamined and not claiming them for your own. Everything from the deepest oceans to the tallest mountains. It's in your nature.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 9]


＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V260]
And you have the nerve to call that the inquisitive spirit? Ugh.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V270]
That said, if I ever needed a lot of magical energy quickly, I could drink blood directly if I had to.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V280]
I won't deny I've taken lives like that to survive at one point or another.[wait tVoice]
[k]


＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V290]
But there's only one of me, and seven billion of you.[sr]It doesn't take an immortal to see who's the bigger threat.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V300]
I'm not going to complain about forming a Servant contract with you at this point...[wait tVoice]
[k]


＠Yu Mei-ren
[tVoice ValVoice_603500 0_V310]
...but don't forget that in the end,[sr]humanity and I can never get along.[wait tVoice]
