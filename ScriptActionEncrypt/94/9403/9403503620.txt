So when your connection to [&him:her] bears fruit...I expect[sr]you to work like a dog without complaint. Understand?
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Kama
Tch... So this is one last bit of salt[sr]in the wounds, huh? Fine, whatever.
[k]

＠Kama
But I still have no idea where you're going with this.
[k]

＠???
Consider it a punishment of sorts.
[k]

＠???
I don't mind what you did to me, but you still caused quite a lot of trouble for everyone else.
[k]

＠???
It's only fair that you work off[sr]your karmic debt, so to speak.

A fake halo now? Really? Knock it off. You're not fooling anyone with that bodhisattva act. It's obvious what you're really up to.
[k]

＠Kama
Can't you just come out and say you're going to make me do good deeds because you know that's the most excruciating torture there is for me?
[k]

＠Kama
Ugh. It must be rough being as old as you are and having to choose all your words carefully because you're worried what people will think.

At any rate, you have a connection to [&him:her] now.
[k]

＠???
After all, you will love anyone,[sr]so long as they're human, yes?
[k]

＠???
Then it should be easy for you to love [&him:her], right?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Kama
...Ouch. I'll admit, you've got me there.[sr]I can't argue with that.
[k]

＠???
Right?
[k]

＠???
I still hold to shujou-muhen-seigando, the vow to save all living things, and butsudou-mujou-seiganjou, the vow to seek enlightenment...
[k]

＠???
Yes, you are a god of love who became a Beast, but I still want to save you if I can.
[k]

＠???
Of course, you may very well not even remember this conversation...or that you are a Beast yourself, or anything at all to do with Beasts.
[k]

[charaFace F 10]

＠Kama
(Sigh) You are so transparently doing this for your own pleasure.

Still...this does mean I might get another chance to surpass you once and for all, right?

And then there's that thing she said to me...

[bgm BGM_MAP_36 0.5 0.4]

“You keep calling yourself the embodiment of infinite love, but I bet you know nothing of the kind of love that comes from watching over someone grow and improve, huh?”
[k]

[charaFace F 20]

＠Kama
(Watching over someone grow and improve, huh...[sr]You think I can't pull that off, bitch? Watch me.)
[k]

＠Kama
(If I succeed at tempting [&him:her] into depravity this[sr]time, I'll be all set. And if I don't, that'll mean[sr][&he's:she's] grown and learned something... Patience, maybe?)
[k]

＠Kama
(Basically, I just need to watch over that, right?[sr]What could be easier? Besides...)
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

[bgm BGM_MAP_36 0.5 1.0]

＠Kama
Hehe. Hehehe. Depending on how things go, I could even end up working beside Pārvatī, couldn't I?
[k]

＠Kama
The very idea of it makes me sick...but, if I think of it as a sanctioned opportunity to make her life hell, I guess I can deal with it.
[k]

＠Kama
I can just imagine her reaction if she saw me seducing someone with her face... Hehehe...
[k]

＠???
Hehe. I'm glad to see you finding joy in an otherwise completely hellish proposition.

Ahh... What a beautiful moonlit dawn. The air is so crisp and clean, and the color of the sky is simply sublime...
[k]

＠Lady-in-Waiting
It is, isn't it?
[k]

＠
This sky looks down upon the Tokugawa's reign of peace.
[k]

＠
A peace Lord Ieyasu established, Lord Hidetada carried on, and Lord Iemitsu made stronger.
[k]

＠
Still... even after the Tokugawa[sr]reign has come to an end...
[k]

＠
...the Japan this sky looks down[sr]upon will surely still be at peace.
[k]

＠Lady-in-Waiting
Hmph. You mustn't let Lord Iemitsu hear you say anything about the Tokugawa reign ending someday, Lady Kasuga. It would put him in a terrible mood.
[k]

＠
Hehe... I'm not so sure about that. If I raised him properly, and I'm quite sure I did...
[k]

＠
...then Lord Iemitsu would only want what is best for Japan, as any loving parent would for their child.
[k]

＠
I expect he would laugh and let[sr]that remark pass with a smile.
[k]

＠Lady-in-Waiting
?
[k]

＠
Oh, don't mind me. I'm talking about a dream, one, two hundred years from now. Besides, he'll never have to know as long as you don't tell him.

Right... Well, sure, I would never[sr]go out of my way to mention this.
