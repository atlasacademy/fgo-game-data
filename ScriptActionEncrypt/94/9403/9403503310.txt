I have seen those occasionally pop up as possibilities during the Atlas Institute's investigations into the apocalypse but I never thought I would get to see one of these “bad ends” for myself.

＠Mash
Still, I can tell just from what you've told us that she's an incredibly formidable threat.
[k]

＠Mash
She's a Beast of Pleasure with power linked to the universe who says she wants to shower all of mankind with love...
[k]

[charaFace E 8]

＠Mash
Kiara's not here anymore because she stayed behind to help the rest of you escape...

Right. The first thing we need to do is determine everything we can about our enemy.

＠Sion
What is she exactly? What can she do, and what can she not do? What sort of properties does she possess?

＠Sion
It is only once we have the answers to all those questions that her weakness will become apparent, and we can plan how best to strike.

Just what is the being calling herself Kama who awaits you at the bottom of the Ooku?

Well... We know she's both Kama, the god of love,[sr]and Mara, the demon of desire.

I've heard that Beasts have multiple forms, so I'm guessing her demonic side must have resonated with Beast III.

Beasts of Disaster usually need to be fought with the power of the seven Grand Servants chosen by the Counter Force.
[k]

[charaFace F 11]

＠Sion
But since this one is still immature, and she is inside this Ooku...or rather, herself...
[k]

＠Sion
...the Counter Force still has[sr]not recognized her as a Beast.
[k]

＠Sion
That must be why we have not yet[sr]seen so much as one Grand Servant.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Sion
Honestly, I think it would be way too reckless[sr]for us to fight a Beast head-on by ourselves.

We should forget that she is a Beast for the moment and look for a weakness intrinsically linked to one of her other properties.

Say, her weakness as Kama, her weakness as Mara,[sr]or a weakness of some other aspect of her altogether.

It would seem that Beast III/L has a lot more going on than the other Beasts we have seen to date.

These must be Beast III/L's characteristics...or her nature, as the Beasts themselves would say.
