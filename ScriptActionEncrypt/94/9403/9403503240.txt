At any rate, you'll find they are very useful.[sr]I'm sure they will help you fill in the gaps.

I don't know whether they'll lead you to joy or pain, but then, hehe, it's all the same in the end...

Oh no, that's all right. I'll always be there if you think of me, and gone if you don't. That is simply what I am.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Besides, it was only ever a fluke that I was able to converse with you at all. That would never have happened were it not for the Beast's stench causing the world to go astray.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
So it doesn't matter what happens to me here. As long as you make it back to Chaldea safely, I'm sure we will see each other again someday.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
When that day comes, I would be ever so grateful if you could find it in you to be merciful to me again.
[k]

[charaFace G 8]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Of course, having a woman like me around certainly won't do anything good for Chaldea's sense of decency.
