Phew, finally, a chance to catch our breath. While we're at it, let me ask you something: What do you make of all this?
[k]

？1：You mean the old guy?
？2：You mean the pianist?

？！

＠Reines
I mean both the old guy and the pianist, of course.[bgm BGM_EVENT_90 0.1][sr]But it's not just them. It's us, too.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]


＠Reines
Remember when you were talking with Mash? We might have recovered some of our memories, but we still don't know what we could be missing even now.
[k]

＠Reines
With all these things we've forgotten, it's almost[sr]like we've taken a drink from the River Lethe.
[k]

？1：The River Lethe?

[charaFace C 7]

＠Reines
One of the rivers of the underworld in Greek myth.[sr]Any pupil of mine should be familiar with the name.
[k]

＠Reines
Dead souls would drink from it before they could be reborn. The waters would wash away all memory of their earthy lives...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Reines
...much the way I forgot mine while I was going around convinced I was El-Melloi II. Like an idiot.
[k]

？2：You mean the river of forgetfulness from The Aeneid?

[charaFace C 1]

＠Reines
So you do know your way around a textbook. That's right. The Roman poet Virgil said its waters would make any dead soul that drank from it forget everything that happened while they lived.
[k]

＠Reines
...Much the way I forgot mine while I was going around convinced I was El-Melloi II. Like an idiot.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 0]

＠Reines
There's also a myth about a river of knowledge called Mnemosyne that was like Lethe's opposite, where anyone who drank from it would gain omniscience.
[k]

？1：Mnemosyne...
？2：That was written on the scrap of paper we found earlier...

？！

＠Reines
At times, Mnemosyne has referred to a goddess of memory, a river, and a spring. At this point, I'd say we could use any one of them!

...By the way, Lady Reines,[sr]what do you make of my question?

？2：Um... Did you just refer to yourself in the third person?

？！

＠Reines
Oh, sorry, that wasn't me. That was Sima Yi,[bgm BGM_EVENT_70 0.1][sr]the Heroic Spirit possessing me.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Reines
He's one of the heroes of China's Three Kingdoms period. I guess he's also why I was able to turn my head all the way around like that.
[k]

＠Reines
It looks like I'm aware of him again[sr]now that I've got some of my memory back.
[k]

＠Reines
Apparently, most Pseudo-Servants fuse together into more of a single entity, but Sima Yi doesn't like that. Says it's inefficient.
[k]

？1：Inefficient?
？2：He sounds...um...animated?

？！

[charaFace C 10]

＠Reines
He says that with humanity at stake, he's willing to help as a Heroic Spirit. But, he finds fusing inefficient, and also doesn't want to bother taking over my consciousness...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]


＠Reines
...so he says he's going to let me handle things most of the time. Certainly fits a Three Kingdoms tactician known for moving slowly and steadily.
[k]


？1：That sounds like something Zhuge Liang would say...
？2：That's just like what happened with El-Melloi...

？！

＠Reines
Hmm, so my brother was possessed by Zhuge Liang in your world, huh. Maybe it's fate that I'd end up in a similar position.

＠Reines
It sounds like Sima Yi strongly objects to that idea, but I'm just going to ignore him and get back to his original question.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Reines
Namely, why was he summoned here?
[k]

？1：Another whydunit...
？2：Maybe it was a Holy Grail or something...?

？！

＠Reines
Hmm. So Holy Grail fragments would frequently summon Rogue Servants in the worlds you visited, huh.
[k]

＠Reines
True, that could be the case here as well. I do have a strong connection to London, and a not insignificant connection to the Holy Grail, too.
[k]

＠Reines
I'd say I easily meet the minimum requirements for becoming a Pseudo-Servant.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Reines
But what sort of connection could I possibly have to a Chinese Heroic Spirit from the Three Kingdoms period?
[k]

？1：Good question...
？2：I was wondering about that myself!

？！

[charaFace C 0]

＠Reines
Of course, there's no telling how far the sphere of humanity's influence truly goes, or how any one person might be related to another. Anything is possible.
[k]

＠Reines
Those whack jobs at the Atlas Institute aside, any mage worth their circuits has to come to terms with that fact sooner or later.
[k]

＠Reines
Who knows? Sima Yi and I might have something[sr]in common neither of us would have ever guessed.
