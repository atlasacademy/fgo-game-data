And the games we've been playing together are so much fun, they've even been showing up in my dreams![wait tVoice]

＠Ushiwakamaru

There was the treasure hunting game we played with the pirates, and the one-lap “the floor is lava” race we ran around Chaldea...![wait tVoice]

The Scáthach Challenge was...[sr]maybe a little TOO tricky...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
[tVoice ValVoice_603400 0_V180]
It gave me flashbacks of my punishment on Mt. Kurama,[sr]and showed up in my dreams in a much different sense than the others, but never mind that.[wait tVoice]
