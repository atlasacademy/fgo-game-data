I see. So Earth was turned an endless[sr]white after you restored humanity.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I knew the human realm was tumultuous, but that's well beyond anything I could have imagined.

And you “Chaldeans” are trying to set things right?

[charaFace A 1]

＠Beni-Enma
That's a huge responsibility for someone so young.[sr]I'm impressed, cheep.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
The Enma-tei is primarily an inn for gods.[sr]We don't usually let humans stay here very long.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
But since you two have found your way here[sr]by accident, I can't turn you away now.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I can't leave the Enma-tei myself, chirp, but I'll do whatever I can to ensure you have a pleasurable time.

Here, help yourselves to this freshly caught yellowtail sashimi. We also have Japanese seerfish broiled with miso and yuzu, if you'd like some.

＠Moneyed Monkey
It's been five hundred years now since I first came to the Enma-tei. I enjoyed it so much I extended my stay.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
Before I knew it, I had mysteriously forgotten the way back to where I came from. I am but an oddball that decided to live here.

What actually happened was he used all the money he had to pay for five centuries of accommodations up front, all because he “didn't want to work anymore.”

They only ever do whatever they feel like and leave anything difficult for someone else to take care of.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
I had more than enough of that for one lifetime, so now, I would like to live out the rest of my days in peace here at the Enma-tei.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
Now come, let me pull up a cushion[sr]and join you as a fellow guest.

Here, young oni, would you care for a glass of Sparrow's Dance, Enma-tei's famous local wine?

They steal food from the pantry, and valuables from the vault. They attack any sparrow they come across out in the mountains... It's chaos.

As a fellow monkey, I did try to lecture them[sr]on the error of their ways, but to no avail.
