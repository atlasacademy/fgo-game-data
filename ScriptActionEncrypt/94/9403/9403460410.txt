Hmm. Whatever the others might say,[sr]I know I didn't take it.

So I can only guess it was Count Vlad.

I'm pretty sure Prince of Lan Ling has enough money[sr]to go toe to toe with me in an auction, after all.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Alexander
...Of course, if push came to shove, he could have always resorted to trying to take it by force...
[k]

＠Alexander
...but if that was his plan, he could have just waited until after the auction was over.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Alexander
So yeah, I think I have to go with Count Vlad here.

？1：I'm pretty sure the Count has thought up some kind of plan...

＠Alexander
I'm sure he was just bluffing.
[k]

＠Alexander
He might be a talented mage, but it still would've been risky for him to come under the spotlight there.

Not to mention Izo's gang doesn't[sr]seem like they'd be much help.

Blood magecraft?

Money, skill in magecraft, timing...
