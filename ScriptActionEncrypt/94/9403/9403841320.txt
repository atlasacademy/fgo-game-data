Ouch. I didn't know Gonroku was still hung up on that.

？！

＠Infantrywoman Nobbu
Oh, when Nobukatsu incited a revolt against me back when we were alive, Gonroku chose to side with him.
[k]

＠Infantrywoman Nobbu
Of course, we managed to work things out,[sr]and he ended up as one of my trusted retainers.
