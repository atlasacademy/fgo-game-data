Lord Nobutsuna...

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
You were never the most sociable person, but I'm certain you cared for the shogun just as much as I did. You were his loyal retainer...

At least we now know that whoever is behind[sr]this is working with people like that.

＠Sion
As a high-ranking shogunate official second only to the shogun himself, he must know all about Edo Castle.

And if he's working with whoever's behind this, maybe he knows where Director Goredolf and the others are, too.

I hope we can get some information out[sr]of him the next time we see him...

Either way, we will need to keep making our way through this labyrinth if we want answers.

[%1], this is where[sr]the real dungeon crawl begins.

[charaFace D 14]
＠Sion
I know it looks impossible to navigate,[sr]but given that someone must have built it...
[k]

＠Sion
...I would be very surprised if there were not some way to determine the correct route.
[k]

[charaFace D 11]
＠Sion
It could just be some kind of idiosyncrasy on the part of its creator during the building process...or it could be something they did intentionally.

＠Sion
Whichever it is, I want you to keep a close eye on your surroundings so you do not miss it!
