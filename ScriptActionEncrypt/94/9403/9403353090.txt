Oho, a tribute, huh. And from you, no less...[sr]Hehe, wonderful! So you have at last decided to recognize your humanity is worse off than our eternal empire![wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V030]
What's that? This is just part of a celebration? Hmm, we see. Another strange custom of your Proper Human History. Well, no matter.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V040]
It was our choice to come and inspect every inch of your world, after all. And this “Valentine's” event intrigues us.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V050]
Now, what do we have here... Hmm, so this is a type of candy? ...Mmph, this is sweet. Very sweet![wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Do you not like it?
？！

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V060]
No, [tdelay 1 1.2 1][charaFace A 2][delay -]it is not that. We are merely overwhelmed by experiencing flavor again for the first time in two thousand years.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V070]
Mmm, it seems an eternity since we have had something this sweet. This is quite delightful in its own right![wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Two thousand years...?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V080]
Well, there was a long period when we did not have a human body, yes? And while we made sure to outfit this Zhenren body with everything it would need, including a tongue...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V090]
...we had forgotten the need to eat, thanks to the particular way in which Servants exist here in Chaldea.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V100]
Hmm... Still, we must say, we are quite taken aback.[sr]Preparing food... The joys of tasting... This would seem to be another glorious aspect of culture.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Is there really that much to think about?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V110]
Well, when ruled over our empire, we were the sole audience, the only human able to truly appreciate art.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V120]
And since we happened to discard the body that needed food, the very concepts of food culture and fine dining were lost as a consequence.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：That's absurd!
？2：Didn't anyone else ever cook?
？！


[charaFace A 2]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V130]
Well, the sage wheat we bestowed upon our subjects was a true superfood that kept their bodies hearty, their minds sharp, and gave them energy to dash three hundred meters if need be.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V140]
Cooking is only necessary to the extent that no food made here is so sublimely perfect as that.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：That does sound pretty amazing, but...
？2：That sounds kind of sad to me.
？！

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V150]
Such a belief could only come to be in Proper Human History, where individuals are free to pursue their own tastes.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V160]
Hmm, Valentine's... Are you sure this is a celebration?[sr]Is it not some depraved heretical ritual to further chaos, as we suspect?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Of course not!
？！

[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V170]
Just earlier today, we saw that pirate captain with the beard going around in a foul mood shouting, “Death to pretty boys!” He did this because he had not received any sweets, yes?[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V180]
When there is a source of pleasure that many desire,[sr]there will inevitably be equal parts jealousy and envy on behalf of those who cannot attain it. We must say, we cannot condone such practices.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：...So, you don't like Valentine's Day then?
？！


[charaFace A 1]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V190]
Haha, now don't look so despondent. This is hardly[sr]the first time we have butted heads regarding how we believe the world ought to be.[wait tVoice]
[k]


[charaFace A 0]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V200]
For our part, we can see the appeal in being surprised by such a sweet assault upon the senses. It is another treasure born of human ingenuity.[wait tVoice]
[k]


[charaFace A 1]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V210]
There is something to be said for a culture so focused on originality and creativity that its overperfection ends up driving it to decline ...Mmm, truly fascinating.[wait tVoice]

You have done well to impart new knowledge to us,[sr]the only Zhenren in existence. There shall be a reward forthcoming at a later time.[wait tVoice]

Hahaha, we tried our hand at imitating the sculptors we had in our employ at Xianyang. Our Zhenren body's hands are just as deft as we expected.[wait tVoice]

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V250]
Our empire may have forgotten the ways of cuisine,[sr]but we had plenty of fine culture of our own. Your gift compelled us to demonstrate that.[wait tVoice]
