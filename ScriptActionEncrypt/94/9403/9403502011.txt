I...I know that name.[sr]It must have belonged to Abaren-Boy Yoshimune...!

＠Scheherazade
He was a very good king.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
He did have a bad habit of dressing up like a commoner and slipping out of his castle...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
...but that is nothing his highness[sr]Harun al-Rashid hasn't done before either.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Perhaps that is just how people[sr]of noble birth like to relax...

Hang on just a little more, Master.[sr]I'll undo your drunken state once we get there, okay?
[k]

？1：I'm not drunk. I'm not.

[charaFace B 3]

＠Mata Hari
Sounds like something someone who's[sr]drunk off their ass would say.
[k]

？2：Thanks, Mata Hari.

If my theory is correct, then we have two large floors ahead of us, one for each of the remaining precepts.

＠Sessyoin Kiara
That would put us on the home stretch of our little marathon session, so to speak. Do be careful, everyone...
