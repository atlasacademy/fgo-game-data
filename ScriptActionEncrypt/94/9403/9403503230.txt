A Beast...? You're one of the Beasts of Disaster that threatens to end all of mankind!?

＠Kama
Oh, I don't know about ending them all. I just do what I want and let the chips fall where they may.
[k]

＠Kama
I loathe humans more than anything, so I will keep giving them love until they all Lapse into depravity.
[k]

＠Kama
I'm a demon king of love, and I'm linked to all the universe. There's no limit to what I can do.
[k]

＠Kama
The universe is infinite, and so is love...
[k]


[charaFace B 4]

＠Kama
Apparently, R called herself the orifice of pleasure and the embodiment of self-love, and tried to gather all of the world's love into herself...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Kama
...but her selfish desires, her goal, and her body all grew so ludicrously big that she ended up at the mercy of Servants.
[k]

＠Kama
Then to top it all off, she ended up falling apart under her own dead weight. She ended up being more funny than scary, it turned out.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Kama
But I'm not selfish like that.[sr]If anything, I'm the polar opposite.
[k]

＠Kama
All I want to do is fill all of mankind[line 2]all of the universe[line 2]with my love.

＠Mata Hari
You make it sound awfully nice, but you'll[sr]have to forgive me if I'm a bit skeptical.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
Because if you're the same kind of being as Goetia, and he was a disaster for all of mankind...I doubt it's as simple as that.

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Yes... That would be bad.[sr]Very, very bad.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
If the god of love were to spread her love to all things until everyone, everywhere was completely satisfied...
[k]

[charaFace D 11]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
...that would be the end of love altogether.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
When living things are given infinite love, they become complete in and of themselves, and no longer need anything from anyone else.
[k]

[charaFace D 14]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
And that means there could never be any new love for[sr]me[line 2][wt 0.6][charaFace D 7]I mean, others, coming into this world...

＠Kama
But the recipients of my infinite love will[sr]get to enjoy themselves forever and ever.
[k]

＠Kama
I can satisfy any desire they have.[sr]I can rid them of any disappointment they have.
[k]

＠Kama
I can spoil them utterly rotten,[sr]no matter how hopeless they may end up.
[k]

＠Kama
And if I do this for all mankind,[sr]doesn't that mean I've saved them?

＠Kama
(Sigh) Fine, call it depravity if you want.[sr]The name really isn't important.
[k]

＠Kama
A Goody Two-shoes like you could never understand what's so great about a world like this.
[k]

[charaFace B 10]
＠Kama
The perfect lover should never betray you. Never disappoint you. Never let you grow bored. Never die on you.
[k]

＠Kama
But you wouldn't know that isn't normal, because that's the kind of lover you've been promised since you were born.
[k]


[charaFace B 6]

＠Kama
...Now, come to me, [%1].
[k]

＠Kama
I know you're not even close to cured. You've just been desperately trying to fight it all this time, haven't you?
[k]

＠Kama
I can't stand to look at you, and you're so garbage I can't help but laugh, but I'll still love you. I'll still make sure you're all filled up.
[k]

＠Kama
You're a Tokugawa now. You have no choice but to indulge in this pit of depravity[line 2]this Ooku filled to the brim with my love[line 2]forever.
[k]

＠Kama
Go on, you'll feel muuuch better once you give in.[sr]Just accept it, and this will all be over.
[k]

Oh wow, that's just cruel. Spartan much, are we?[sr]Just put [&him:her] out of [&his:her] misery and let [&him:her] give in.
[k]



[charaFace B 6]
＠Kama
It's okay, [%1]. Don't worry about a[sr]thing. Just give yourself over to me...and Lapse into depravity.
[k]

＠Kama
This is a cold, lonely, endless world.[sr]An infinite universe without beginning or end.
[k]

[charaFace B 17]
＠Kama
Here, I'll show you what real love and desire are, just like I did for the one who trained under the Bodhi Tree.
[k]

＠Kama
You don't have to do anything hard. You don't have to search for any meaningless right answers.
[k]

＠Kama
I can provide infinite depravity for everyone.[sr]I can provide eternal satisfaction for all.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Kama
It's okay, trust me. The fires of my love are more than strong enough to heat up this entire universe!
