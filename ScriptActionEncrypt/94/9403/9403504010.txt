You're telling me the whole reason he betrayed the Tokugawa shogunate to begin with was so he could imbue his own life with Anti-Tokugawa properties?

And that he chose to be killed just so he could turn himself into a Tokugawa-Slayer and help defeat me?

I don't even know where to begin. It's...utter nonsense! Worse than that! It's... I can't even come close to describing how sickening it is!

Well done, Lord Nobutsuna. You may have handled it a little clumsily, like always, but regardless, you've truly outdone yourself.

The Tokugawa family could never ask for a more faithful retainer. In fact, I'll put it another way.
