I feel as aimless and unmoored[sr]as a dandelion seed on the wind...
[k]

＠
This must be how lost I felt back then, too.[sr]That explains why I remember so clearly.
[k]

＠
That's right. I remember now.
[k]

＠
I thought I had accepted that my time had come to an end. I thought I was chanting prayers to the Buddha as I drifted in and out of sleep in my futon.
[k]

＠
But then, at the very last moment, right as I let go of the final thread tethering my soul to this world...I made a wish.
[k]

＠
I didn't accept it. I wanted to stay[sr]and keep loving the Tokugawa family.

Master! Please, get ahold of yourself, Master!

It looks like our connection is still barely hanging[sr]in there... Maybe Kama's love is doing this too?

Maybe it is her way of saying that even if we can[sr]communicate with [&him:her], there is nothing we can do to[sr]change [&his:her] situation?
[k]

＠Sion
At least I was able to adjust the Anti-Tokugawa field's output so that it is just barely able to fend off the Tokugawa-fication mental attack.
[k]

＠Sion
...But I do not know how long that will last.
[k]

Still, for the moment, let us[sr]try to stay calm and not panic!

It's okay. We're all here.

We can't see anything either, but at least we can kind of sense where the other Servants are from their magical energy.

Now I'm alone. All alone.[sr]But that's okay. I deserve to be punished.
[k]

＠
I deserve to die for what I've done.
[k]

＠
I'm a malefactor who brought a Beast of Love here through my obsession. I brought about the Tokugawa's ruin.
[k]

＠
Lady Par should never have saved me.
[k]

＠
Still... I know I don't have any right to ask,[sr]but if I could make one final request...
[k]

＠
...I would have liked to die in the[sr]place to which I dedicated my life.
[k]

＠
I know I had few allies there. I know a lot of people must dislike me for ruling it so heavy-handedly.
[k]

＠
But, even so...it's where I belong. If I'm going to die, that's where I'd like to spend my final moments.
[k]

＠
In fact, why AREN'T I there right now?
[k]

＠
(...)
[k]

＠
(...No.)
[k]

＠
Think. I entered Edo Castle. I went into the Nakaoku.[sr]I went down the Osuzurouka, then I went further.
[k]

＠
Even though that wicked god of love turned it into a labyrinth... Even though it has an impossible basement now...
[k]

＠
Even though it was so riddled with mistakes and misconceptions that I kept denying it...
[k]

＠
...[wt 2.0]I heard [&him:her] say, plain as day:
[k]

＠
“In my mind, this place has always been...[wt 1.2]the Ooku.”
[k]

＠
Why? Why!?
[k]

＠
Why does [&he:she] think that?[sr]Could it be...
[k]

＠
(...Maybe I had the wrong idea all along.)
[k]

＠
Yes, that's right. I'll admit that I did something terrible. I'll admit that I'm a fool.
[k]

＠
But that doesn't mean I'm not still[sr]the same person I always was.
[k]

＠
It doesn't mean that my life[sr]up to this point was a mistake.
[k]

＠
After all, if an ordinary [&boy:girl] like [&him:her] still knows[sr]about the Ooku hundreds of years in the future,[sr]I couldn't have gotten it that wrong.
[k]

＠
So I need to take responsibility.[sr]I need to fulfill my duties as the head of the Ooku.
