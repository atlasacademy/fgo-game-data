No need to be so formal. Today is a wonderful day! It's commercialized, systematic... Everything I could ask for.[wait tVoice]

Valentine's, was it? It originated in the Mediterranean, and developed into a commercial endeavor in the Far East.[wait tVoice]

＠David
[tVoice ValVoice_200600 0_V070]
One could even call it a glorious fusion of cultures. I find it especially interesting how it centers on a sweet derived from South American cacao beans.[wait tVoice]

＠David
[tVoice ValVoice_200600 0_V080]
So all together, we have the Mediterranean...the Far East...and South America. What a greed[line 2]I mean, glorious holiday. It's practically taken the whole world by storm.[wait tVoice]

It's a day to say how we really feel, right? It's so...efficient. Just the sort of systematic endeavor I like.[wait tVoice]

Honestly, I wouldn't mind if we celebrated it at least once a week, but oh well. Modesty in all things, as they say.[wait tVoice]

That goes for business, contracts, war, and of course, love.[wait tVoice]

Which is why, thoughtful as I am, I never forget to return a kindness. You gave me chocolate this morning, right? So I got this for you.[wait tVoice]
