Oh, Master. What brings you to my workshop?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：You mean this isn't Da Vinci's Workshop...?

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V020]
No, but I based this one off of it.[sr]I also modified the tools to better suit my needs.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：This is your workshop, Avicebron?

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V030]
It is. There doesn't seem to be any need to[sr]mass-produce golems right now, so a small workshop like this with everything I need for custom designs seems more fitting.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？！

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V040]
Since we don't have much in the way of human resources,[sr]I expect my golems can help fill in the gaps nicely.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V050]
That's why I created them in the first place. I would[sr]be honored if they could be of use to all of you.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：What's this golem for...?
？！

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V060]
Ah, that's a server golem, made for setting tables and serving food. One of the cafeteria Servants requested it.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V070]
Its only real flaw is that it's slower to move and react than Servants, so it hasn't been able to stop people from sneaking food.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V080]
Speaking of which...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V090]
...it would be a great help if you were to tell the biggest offenders not to sneak food too, Master.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V100]
Those tend to be the child Servants, the heavy drinker Servants, and the selfish Servants.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：G-got it!
？！

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V110]
Oops, there I go rambling on again.[sr]Is there something I can do for you?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：I made this chocolate for you.

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V140]
Servants have no need to eat, of course.[sr]But, that doesn't mean I can't eat if I wish.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V150]
So I would be glad to accept.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Well, bye now!
？！

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V160]
Right. See you later.[wait tVoice]

Master, we have an emergency.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：The way you moved so fast just now looks kind of familiar!

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V180]
I used a two-wheel drive golem to get around at ultrafast speeds.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V190]
But never mind that, Master. There's something much more important we need to discuss.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：Wh-what is it!?

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V200]
I just found out something of great importance.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？！

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V210]
...That gift you gave me earlier was a valentine, wasn't it?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V220]
I hope you can forgive me. I'm afraid I don't know the first thing about these sorts of events.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V230]
Of course, I'm aware that this holiday's origins differ from my own religion...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V240]
...but given our circumstances,[sr]I believe it's worth celebrating anything we can.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V250]
So on that note, here is my return gift.[wait tVoice]

Yes. You may have seen them before, of course.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？！

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V280]
I think you'll find that food items which move on their own can be quite useful.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V290]
They won't be much help in battle...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V300]
...but in daily life, they should be useful in all sorts of situations.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V310]
I designed them to respond only to your voiceprint.[sr]Though of course, they can only follow simple commands.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Thank you, Avicebron.

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V320]
Of course. As long as you're happy with them,[sr]it was well worth the trouble to make them.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：I can't wait to cuddle them.

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V330]
Cuddle them...?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V340]
I see. So that's another thing you can do with golems shaped like this.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V350]
I'll have to remember that. Thank you.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？！

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V360]
Come to think of it, nowadays, they call golems similar to the ones I make “robots,” don't they?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V370]
And instead of the Kabbalah, they use science alone to create inhuman humans...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V380]
The march of progress is truly both frightening and heartening.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V390]
Even as a shadow of the past,[sr]there is still much for me to learn.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：You know, we've got plenty of robot videos here.

？2：Want to watch some robot videos with me?
？！

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V400]
Videos?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V410]
...Oho. In the library, you say?[sr]Oho, oho.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V420]
That sounds fascinating. Truly fascinating.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V430]
Very well then, let's watch these videos together, for future reference.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Avicebron
[tVoice ValVoice_503600 0_V440]
We can even enjoy having our chocolates at the same time.[wait tVoice]
