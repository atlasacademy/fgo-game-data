＠Reines
You know, I thought I sensed some other intent at work ever since we noticed that they'd scattered those scraps of paper.
[k]

＠Reines
I'm guessing those scraps were a byproduct[sr]of reproducing these Demon God Pillars.
[k]

＠Reines
Whoever arranged all this probably prepared them in case things got dicey like this, but they clearly didn't think it through.

You've been getting sloppy since you started this repeat performance. This ability might be a powerful trump card, but it's not exactly cut out for combat.

It is. All the conditions for my Noble Phantasm are now in place. It should indeed work well, even under these somewhat unexpected circumstances.

After all, that is exactly what my Noble[sr]Phantasm was originally intended for.

＠E：Reines
Hehehe, these foes have been causing[sr]us a great deal of trouble!
[k]

＠E：Reines
So I decided to turn the tables and use[sr]their memory rewriting methods against them!
[k]


？1：How did you do that!?

？！


＠E：Reines
Memories can become energy, and vast amounts of energy can be used to falsify memories, remember?
[k]

＠E：Reines
Since both this space and the Demon God Pillars are memories come to life, the same holds true for them.
[k]

＠E：Reines
On top of that, my Noble Phantasm's strength lies[sr]in destroying advantages and exposing weaknesses.
[k]

＠E：Reines
As long as the conditions are in place, it can even create weaknesses where none previously existed.
[k]


＠E：Reines
So, just like when your own memories were falsified...
[k]

＠E：Reines
...I used those scraps and my Noble Phantasm[sr]to introduce a new false memory into this space.
[k]



＠E：Reines
Specifically, I created a memory where these things have a glaringly fatal weakness.
[k]

？1：What weakness?
？2：I don't remember Demon God Pillars having a weakness.

＠E：Reines
You are the Demon God Pillars' weakness.
[k]

＠E：Reines
There has never been anyone else in human history who has slain as many Pillars as you. You're easily the world record holder.
[k]

＠E：Reines
With all that to your name, your prowess at slaying them is on par with a Heroic Spirit's special attack!
[k]

＠E：Reines
Remember that there are some Heroic Spirits out there who can be slain by a bit of cheese to the head, simply because that is part of their legend!
[k]


＠E：Reines
Imagine what sort of power recreating an event that genuinely happened must have! That's why I snuck data of you into these Demon God Pillar reproductions!
[k]


＠E：Reines
Now, just facing you is enough to make them feel like they're having a nightmare!
[k]

＠E：Reines
Tragic, isn't it? You just hate to see it!
[k]



？1：Wow! Way to go, Professor!

＠Reines
There might still be a lot of them to deal with, but I'm pretty sure me, Astraea, and Gray can mow them all down now!
[k]

＠Reines
And if this temple and the Demon God Pillars are one and the same, defeating enough of the latter should make this whole space go away on its own!
