Ivan and I aren't exactly on great terms, but we decided to put aside our differences just for this tournament.

＠Anastasia
I too heartily agree that the Russian tsars are the rightful heirs to Santa Claus's throne.

[charaFace H 0]
＠Anastasia
And since our interests align, here we are. Sure, his eyes are kind of...okay, very scary, but I can deal with them.
[k]

＠Anastasia
And so, history's two strongest tsars came together to form a dream team to achieve their mutual goal!
[k]

＠Anastasia
Oh, and we don't answer to Black Quetzal Mask. We're one of the Four Heavenly Kings because we're just that strong.
[k]

＠Anastasia
Just to be clear.
[k]

＠Ivan the Terrible
In my Russia, we need not concern ourselves with who shall be the reindeer. That role will go to Old Man Frost[line 2]Ded Moroz.

Anastasia could have been Snegurochka,[sr]the snow maiden, of course, but[line 2]
