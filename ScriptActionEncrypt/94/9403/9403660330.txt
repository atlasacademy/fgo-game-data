The Tower of London itself is quite spacious. And, as you can see, the part known as the Bloody Tower is heavily guarded.

I noticed that when we first got here. It feels like the whole place is neatly divided into areas with lax security and areas with tight security.

Truth be told, I've wanted to meet the pianist myself,[sr]but that's rather difficult to do on one's own.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠M
But, as fortune would have it, the two of you[sr]showed up just when I needed assistance!
[k]


＠M
What else could this be but a spider's thread of salvation! What do you say! Will you help me!?
[k]

？1：So that's why you asked us to come with you...
？2：Are we sure he's not a bad guy?

？！

[charaFace C 1]

＠M
Oh no, my motives are quite pure, I assure you. I merely wish to satisfy my curiosity by meeting this mysterious pianist, much as I presume you do.

？！

＠M
Come now, surely you wouldn't ask an old man like me to exert himself to such a degree? As they say, one must always use the right tool for the job.

I knew London had always had its share of ghosts, but[sr]I doubt you'll find masked ones in any other borough.

At any rate, these are fairly formidable foes! You keep your guard up, and I'll try to keep from throwing my back out!
