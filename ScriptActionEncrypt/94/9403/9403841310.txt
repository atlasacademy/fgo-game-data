That's right. We can no longer keep our distance from Shibata and wait for him to retreat, like we did before.

＠Chief Retainer Mash
If we're going to invade Demon King Nobunaga's base in Azuchi, we'll need to find a way to defeat him.

He said we'd find the Heroic Spirit we need to beat old man Shibata in Oumi, but we never found anyone like that.
