Of course I do. If I'd known Salazar planned to kill him, I'd have put an arrow through his heart myself.

Then how about we work together? You look like you know your way around this mansion well.

＠Roma
If you know of any good hiding spots here,[sr]I'd like you to tell me.

What is it?

A report on the coup that took place ten years ago.[sr]It's part of Cortés's legacy.
[k]

＠Roma
It says that Daizou and General[sr]Tan ended up killing each other.
[k]

＠Roma
General Tan was the best swordsman in the army...the whole country, really. He's the only one who could possibly defeat Daizou in a fair fight.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠García
Yeah, General Tan was amazing.[sr]He was noble, brave, well-liked...
[k]

＠García
I never would have guessed his last opponent was Daizou Oka, the sword demon.
[k]

＠Roma
Are you still unconvinced?
[k]

＠García
...No, I believe you. I'm also trying to find some closure regarding my best friend's death, personally.
[k]

＠García
Come on. I'll show you every room where that bastard could possibly hide.
