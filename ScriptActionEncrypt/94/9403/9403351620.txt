Indeed, at times, we pharaohs' generosity knows no bounds.[wait tVoice]

I, too, have learned many things. I may not be able to conduct myself as Lord Ozymandias does...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Nitocris
[tVoice ValVoice_501200 0_V080]
...but I should still occasionally demonstrate how generous I can be, like the great god-kings of old.[wait tVoice]
