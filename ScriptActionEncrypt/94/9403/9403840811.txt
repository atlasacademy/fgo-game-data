＠Sakamoto Ryouma
First, let's just take a step[sr]back and think about this.
[k]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
It seems pretty clear that he's growing stronger with every step he takes.
[k]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
In other words, he must be using a Noble Phantasm that makes that happen, which is entirely possible.
[k]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
His extraordinary healing seems entirely possible too, as there's Servants capable of similar feats in Chaldea.
[k]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
However, we also know that neither[sr]ability can last forever.

[charaFadein E 0.1 1]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
Exactly. I'm guessing his abilities must only cover so much distance.
[k]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
Even an NP that increases its user's power the further the user gets from its activation point has to have a limit.
[k]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
In other words, this NP can't make its user any stronger once they leave its range.

[k]

[charaFace E 5]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
Anyway, given that this guy doesn't seem to be doing much in the way of thinking, I'm guessing he's a Berserker, which is a magical energy-intensive class to begin with.
[k]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
If I'm right about that, it's all the more reason he'll hit his limit sooner or later.

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
I'm afraid it's not that simple.[sr]See, I've been poking around since I got here...
[k]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
...and I learned that, while it's fairly easy to get into this Singularity, getting out is another matter entirely.
[k]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
Basically, none of us will be going anywhere until I've filled in a few more pieces of the puzzle.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
Especially since Oryou and I got separated from Izo and Okita Alter.

That's right. It looks like our coordinates got scrambled when we Rayshifted here...

[charaFace E 11]

But, I'm sure they'll be fine.[sr]They can definitely handle themselves, after all.

Yeah, Izo's pretty gullible. Oryou wouldn't be surprised if he ended up dying in the wilderness somewhere.

？！

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
Anyway, getting back on track...
[k]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
I'm guessing that Berserker's range only extends from his base to this province's border.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
Once he exceeds that range, he probably has to return to the base that supplies magical energy and start over.
[k]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
He's absurdly strong for sure,[sr]but luckily, there's only one of him.
[k]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
And since he can't move all that fast, we shouldn't have to worry about him attacking frequently.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
So I say we take advantage of this time to gather information and figure out a more definitive resolution.
[k]

？1：Like what?

＠Nagao Kagetora
So perhaps cutting off his magical energy supply at its source? Or finding and killing his Master?

That would certainly work, assuming he has a Master.
[k]

？2：So like, destroying his base or something?

[charaFace E 6]
[charaFace F 0]

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
If we can find out where his base is,[sr]that would certainly be an option.
[k]

？！

＠Sakamoto Ryouma
As far as I can tell, this is the farthest east he's ever appeared, so I'd guess his base is somewhere in the Kinki region.

I'm not really cut out for serving a clan, and besides, there's still a few things I want to look into.
