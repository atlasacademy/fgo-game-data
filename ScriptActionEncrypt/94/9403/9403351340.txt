You know...[sr]I can tell you put a lot of heart into this present...[wait tVoice]

＠Alexander
[tVoice ValVoice_401500 0_V040]
So I guess I'd better return the favor.[sr]What would you like?[wait tVoice]

？1：There's no rush. It can wait till next month, you know.

A good king can't only be on the receiving end.[sr]One of my teachers taught me that.[wait tVoice]

Then again, it might have been him? Or maybe her? Either way, it really takes me back.[wait tVoice]

If I was all grown up, I might say something about how you should just take whatever you want, but never mind that.[wait tVoice]

This is a scroll based on the ones from my time, and this is a paperback book from yours.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Alexander
[tVoice ValVoice_401500 0_V110]
In terms of portability, I'd say the paperback wins easily, but go ahead and choose whichever one you'd prefer to read.[wait tVoice]

＠Alexander
[tVoice ValVoice_401500 0_V120]
Oh, right.[sr]There's just one thing you need to be careful of.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Alexander
[tVoice ValVoice_401500 0_V130]
The scroll is written in, well, Greek. And not the modern dialect, but the real old-fashioned kind.[wait tVoice]

If you don't think you can read it yourself...[wait tVoice]
