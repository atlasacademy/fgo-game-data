So that is the name of the next[sr]shogun after Lord Iemitsu.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Assuming everything goes well, that would mean Lord Iemitsu's son, Takechiyo, ends up taking over from his father without any issue...

Isn't it confusing, having every shogun from the first to the fourth go by the same childhood name?

Oho, that's an excellent question; one that I don't think I've ever been asked before. I guess it's time for another impromptu wet nurse classroom then!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
“Takechiyo” was originally[sr]Lord Ieyasu's childhood name.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
And since he was the one who united Japan and founded the shogunate, it was thought that giving his descendants the same name would bring good fortune.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
And of course, there is only one heir in waiting at any given time, so no two children go by the same name.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
So we never have to worry about[sr]anyone getting confused.

For that matter, Takechiyo was, of course, in Edo Castle along with his father when this happened.
[k]

[charaFace B 13]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
And naturally, it is my duty as a loyal retainer of the Tokugawa family to save him as well. Hmm. Maybe this pillbox has some connection to him?

Oh, by the way, I'm afraid there's a little problem.
[k]

＠Mash
We've been seeing more static on our connection the further you delve into the Ooku.
[k]

＠Mash
And since we need to prioritize existence verification above all, we might end up losing the connection at times.
[k]

＠Mash
I'll do everything I can to prevent that from happening, but I think you should be prepared in case it does...
[k]

？1：Hey, I've been in a subway. It makes sense[csr]that we'd lose some signal the further down we go.

＠Mash
Now that you mention it, I remember you mentioning some kind of underground labyrinths that still exist in the modern day, Master.
