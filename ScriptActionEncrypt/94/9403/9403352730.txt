I hope you're ready, Master. This year, I came fully prepared.[wait tVoice]

I never really gave it much thought before, but it makes sense that a modern-day child would prefer modern-day gifts.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_202800 0_V040]
Which is why I thought long and hard about just what kind of things a modern-day child would like![wait tVoice]

I didn't do a deep data dive or anything, but I did find something where I instantly knew I had a winner.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_202800 0_V060]
Something I knew you would be sure to love. And not just you, but Mash, too.[wait tVoice]

...But then again, maybe I shouldn't hype it up too much.[wait tVoice]

But, I really did find something I was positive today's kids would love.[wait tVoice]

It kind of felt like intuition! And it was something different from the voice of Mahatma, too.[wait tVoice]

I asked Da Vinci to let me look through a bunch of archive data. I must have spent half a day going through it all.[wait tVoice]

But then, I saw it: chocolate made to look like adorable little caricatures![wait tVoice]

＠Helena
[tVoice ValVoice_202800 0_V140]
And of course, since I knew I would be giving it to you, I used Chaldea's Heroic Spirits for inspiration.[wait tVoice]

Hehe. So? Pretty “hip,” isn't it! I just knew you modern-day kids would love it![wait tVoice]

Did I make a bad choice? Is it actually something from one or two generations ago, rather than the modern day?[wait tVoice]

I-it is? Oh... B-but, I really thought I had a winner with this...[wait tVoice]
