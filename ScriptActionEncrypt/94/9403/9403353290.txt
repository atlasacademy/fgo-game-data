You receive a strange and mysterious gift from Maria...

There is no particular reason for it,[sr]nor is it even clear who actually sent it.

On paper, it looks to be a gift from Maria, with her evasive tongue and outstandingly gleaming smile.

But, knowing you...I'm sure you'll understand.

It's a conductor's baton. One so inky black it looks as though it's been scorched by wildfire.

Maria would never give you anything like this.[sr]Neither would I. And there's the rub.

However it managed to get to you...

Good grief. He couldn't have gone about it more roundabout way if he'd tried.
