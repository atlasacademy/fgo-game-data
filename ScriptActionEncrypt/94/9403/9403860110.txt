Great, just what we needed.

＠Mori Nagayoshi
I wish he'd drop a teapot or something like that when he comes by. Then I'd at least have a reason to be excited about fighting him again.

Well, he's too strong for the infantry to handle alone. We'll have to do something about him ourselves.

＠Nagao Kagetora
True. Even if he will eventually have to retreat once he runs out of magical energy, he'll still cause incalculable damage along the way.

＠Nagao Kagetora
Even if we can't defeat him,[sr]we can at least help wear him out faster.

All right, I guess I can use him[sr]to rack up some more points.

＠Mori Nagayoshi
In fact, now that I think about it, the fact that he won't die from a few hits means I can keep killing him as much as I like!

I'm not sure what part of that qualifies as thinking, but no matter! Let's be off then!
