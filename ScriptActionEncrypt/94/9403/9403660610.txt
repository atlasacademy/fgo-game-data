＠Lion King
Those who do no evil nor will they know evil even when affected by it. Those who know no end to goodness and yet are not aware of their goodness.
[k]

＠Lion King
I shall gather those purest souls,[sr]freeze them, and archive them.
[k]

＠Lion King
No matter how much time passes, I will store them in[sr]my lance as something whose value will never change.
[k]

＠Lion King
What is wrong with that?[sr]My work is all for you, humans.
[k]

？1：WE ARE NOT SOME BUTTERFLIES ON A BOARD!

？！

＠Lion King
...Is that what you think?
[k]

＠Lion King
...Is that also what you think?[sr]O Knight of the Shield?
[k]

＠Lion King
Human lives are finite. Amongst them,[sr]there are few whose lives are even more limited.
[k]

＠Lion King
Mash Kyrielight, you understand my ideal, don't you?

[%1], that's enough talking! The Lion King's[sr]mental structure is now completely that of a deity!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
She's lost her values as a human![sr]This won't end with just talk!

＠Dr. Roman
Fight, and destroy that lance![sr]Time will return to normal if you do that!

＠Lion King
...Imprudent, Romani Archaman. That is much like you[sr]However, I have come to the same conclusion.
[k]

＠Lion King
You've answered the question.[sr]If you are to deny me, I will deny you, as well.
[k]

＠Lion King
Your death is inevitable, and now it draws near.[sr]Lament the limits on your life.
[k]

＠Lion King
Know those limits, and accept my divine grace.
[k]

＠Lion King
Knight of the Shield, if you want to protect human lives...you will not fight me.
