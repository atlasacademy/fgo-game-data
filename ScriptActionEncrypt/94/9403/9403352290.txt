Hello, Master. Did something good happen? You look in exceptionally good spirits this morning.[wait tVoice]

Your cheeks are a little flushed, but you don't seem to have a cold. If anything, you're positively radiant.[wait tVoice]

Yes, that rosy red glow truly suits you. I don't know why you are so happy, but your joy is palpable and infectious.[wait tVoice]

If the reasons for your joy have anything to do with me, then this will be a wonderful day indeed.[wait tVoice]

？1：I'm, uh, not exactly nervous or anything, but...
？2：Well, more or less.

This is...the sweet known as chocolate, right?[sr]We did have butter cakes in Uruk...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Enkidu
[tVoice ValVoice_300800 0_V070]
...but we were never able to make anything as luxurious as this. And you're really giving it...to me?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：It's a token of my appreciation.
？2：I wanted you to try some.

...This is quite a surprise. You know I'm a weapon, yet you always treat me like a person.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_300800 0_V090]
I can't say whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. But I can express my feelings about it.[wait tVoice]

Thank you. I will keep this gift safe, and treasure it always.[wait tVoice]

Although, now I'm a little ashamed. I'm very happy to have received this chocolate...[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_300800 0_V120]
...but I have no gift for you that can adequately express this gratitude. All I have is this.[wait tVoice]

I feel like a little girl in a story, repaying a gift with a wildflower, but I hope you can overlook that.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Enkidu
[tVoice ValVoice_300800 0_V140]
That flower best expresses how I feel right now. It isn't much, but I hope you will take good care of it.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Of course!

[charaFace A 3]
＠Enkidu
[tVoice ValVoice_300800 0_V150]
Thank you. It may be no more than an object produced by another object, but I would be very proud if it were to become a part of your dreams.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：There IS something beautiful about white flowers.

Do you think so? That flower there may resemble a portrait, but all I did was make it by modeling it after[line 2][wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_300800 0_V170]
Well, maybe I don't need to tell you about that. It's nicer if you don't see it.[wait tVoice]

Master. Please, don't ever forget your modest way of life.[wait tVoice]
