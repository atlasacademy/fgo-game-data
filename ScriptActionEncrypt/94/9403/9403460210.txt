＠Moriarty
Now then, let's assume each group pursues the best course of action for them to seize control of this city.
[k]

[scene 71101 1.0]
＠Moriarty
Group A, Diarmuid, would ideally like[sr]to team up with Izo to take out Yan Qing.
[k]

[scene 71102 1.0]

＠Moriarty
Once that's done, he could take his time folding Izo's small organization into his own.
[k]

＠Moriarty
But that would not be to Izo's interests.
[k]

＠Moriarty
While he may be able to get rid of Yan Qing that way,[sr]it would leave him helpless against Diarmuid.
[k]

＠Moriarty
And that, of course, would all but assure his defeat.[sr]As such, Izo can never team up with Diarmuid.
[k]

[scene 71103 1.0]

＠Moriarty
So then, you might think Izo could just team up with Yan Qing to take out Diarmuid, but there, too, you would be wrong.
[k]

＠Moriarty
After all, they too are now an[sr]inextricable part of the city!
[k]

[scene 71104 1.0]

＠Moriarty
Then, what if Group A, Diarmuid, teams up with Group B, Yan Qing, to take out Group C, Izo, first?
[k]

＠Moriarty
Yes, such a team up would let them take out Izo easily, but also lead to its own rather messy set of problems.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Without enough people working the docks,[sr]the city's economy would all but grind to a halt.
[k]

＠Moriarty
More than that, neither group truly NEEDS[sr]to team up with the other to take Izo down.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Both A and B would merely hope that their partner ends up bearing the lion's share of the losses in the battle to destroy C.
[k]

[messageOff]

[scene 71100 1.0]
[wt 1.5]

＠Moriarty
In summary, there is no viable path forward for any group. Forming an alliance, going on the attack...neither of these are feasible options.

It is quite the stalemate.

Yes, but this will be something of a miniature version[line 2]a kind known as a Subspecies Holy Grail War.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Three mages are scheduled to arrive here tomorrow.

＠Moriarty
They will begin by making bids[sr]for the relic in question.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

...so of course, the mages taking part in this Holy Grail War all wish to secure it for themselves.

But the real problem...
