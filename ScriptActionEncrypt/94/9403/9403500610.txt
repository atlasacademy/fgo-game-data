Hmm... You're quite the formidable figure yourself, aren't you, Lady Sessyoin? Albeit in a different way from Lady Par.

Don't be so modest. I know a number of monks with Buddhist names like yours, and you're on a completely different level from them.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Be honest: You're actually something of a monk guru, aren't you?
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I mean, we already have a goddess from India here. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if you turned out to be an avatar of the Buddha himself!

Teehee. Me, an avatar of the Buddha?[sr]Goodness, no. I am me. No more. No less.

...Tell me Lady Kasuga-no-Tsubone,[sr]why would you think such a thing?

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Well, it's obvious from everything I've seen so far.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
You aren't the least bit afraid of those bizarre dolls, you use powers and combat techniques I've never seen before...
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Even in my wildest dreams, I never imagined there was anyone in the world who could do the things you can.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Well, I guess there is a shady old monk by the name of Tenkai that's part of the shogun's inner circle.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
They say he uses some suspicious techniques himself, but I never paid those rumors much attention because, well, they're suspicious.

So this is my first time actually seeing evil dispelled with the power of the Buddha.

I see... Well, the sect to which I...belong is quite small and rather...unique, so I suppose our techniques must seem ever so unusual to an outsider.

Now that I think about him, Tenkai must have been abducted along with everyone else in Edo Castle.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
And to think, he was supposed to keep the shogun safe from strange curses and things like...well, what's happening right now.
[k]

[charaFace A 17]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Once I've rescued the shogun, I'll have to whisper “Tenkai must be punished... Tenkai must be punished...” in his ear while he's asleep.

A-anyway, having you here really[sr]is a big help for us, Kiara.

(Although... How can she have such a powerful Spirit Origin without being a proper Heroic Spirit...?)

(...Then again, there are some Servants, like Assassin Emiya, who can't operate in the open...)

(Maybe she was chosen by the Counter[sr]Force for a similar purpose?)

One cannot walk the path of the Buddha and be free from adversity. I can embrace pain and suffering where needed...
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
...but our path here is not one of pilgrimage, but of the Ooku hidden away from the sun. We surely have a long way to go yet.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Perhaps for the time being, we should try easier route? They are sure to have enemies we can more unreservedly enjoy...fighting against.
