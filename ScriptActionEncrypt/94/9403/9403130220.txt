In the legends of Charlemagne, Bradamante is generally depicted as pursuing her lover, Ruggiero.

They started out as enemies, but fell in love after fighting a duel, only for fate to tear them apart...

That's why we're keeping the fighters' info top secret, even from the other fighters. We're also keeping the brackets all hush-hush, meow.
