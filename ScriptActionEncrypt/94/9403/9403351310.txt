Oh, and be careful. Whatever you do, do not leave my side. One wrong move, and you could end up as food for Soul Eaters or chimeras.[wait tVoice]

Of course, this is just the simulator, so I doubt you would actually end up hurt...[wait tVoice]

＠d'Eon
[tVoice ValVoice_102600 0_V170]
...but Dr. Roman did say that it's not a good idea to interrupt a simulation in progress.[wait tVoice]

？1：I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.
？2：Maybe I should come back later?

？！

[tVoice ValVoice_102600 0_V180]
Oh no, not at all. I could never send you back after you've come all this way on your own.[wait tVoice]

I'm guessing...you're here about chocolate?[wait tVoice]

I do recall that being a tradition where you're from, yes. Hehe. I don't usually think about things like that.[wait tVoice]

Is that right? You're giving chocolate...to me?[wait tVoice]

I vow to do all I can to live up to your expectations. I may be a Heroic Spirit and a Servant, but I am first and foremost a knight.[wait tVoice]

To be clear, this is not my room, but the authors'. I had Andersen and Shakespeare lend it to me, just for tonight.[wait tVoice]

Not so we could read books, mind you. It's because this room has a fireplace.[wait tVoice]

＠d'Eon
[tVoice ValVoice_102600 0_V380]
...I would pop a marshmallow, still hot and dripping from the fire, into my mouth. At times like that, it is hard to say if I was d'Eon de Beaumont, the knight...[wait tVoice]
