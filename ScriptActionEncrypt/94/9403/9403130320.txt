...A present drop, hm. It would seem you have at least the bare minimum of pride necessary for a Santa.

Very well, a loss is a loss.[sr]I concede, and we shall step aside for you.

＠Santa Alter
But remember, this is only the beginning. From here on, you shall face all manner of aspiring Santas.

I agree with that, of course...but I must say, I was surprised how serious your opponents were about winning.

We should probably expect the other upcoming[sr]battles to be similarly challenging...
