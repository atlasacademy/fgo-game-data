...[servantName 602900:Assassin of Paraíso:Mochizuki Chiyome], reporting in.

＠A：[servantName 602900:Assassin of Paraíso:Mochizuki Chiyome]
I have returned with all the information I was able[sr]to gather about our target, the house of mirrors.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 602900:Assassin of Paraíso:Mochizuki Chiyome]
The most notable bit of information I have to report is that this will be the first time we will have to deal with an indoor attraction.

Indeed. Next, I shall explain how the[sr]attraction is meant to be enjoyed.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 602900:Assassin of Paraíso:Mochizuki Chiyome]
Its interior is something of a labyrinth,[sr]and every wall is lined with mirrors.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 602900:Assassin of Paraíso:Mochizuki Chiyome]
Visitors are meant to go in as a group and search for the exit as the bizarre environs cause them to grow more and more lost and confused.

Still, according to the gossip[sr]I overheard among the oni...

[charaFace A 0]

＠A：[servantName 602900:Assassin of Paraíso:Mochizuki Chiyome]
