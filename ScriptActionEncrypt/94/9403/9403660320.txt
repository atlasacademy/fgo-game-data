＠Reines
So this is the palace... Looks like everyone's wearing masks here too, unsurprisingly.
[k]

？1：I'm surprised we got in so easily.
？2：I was sure the security guards were going to stop us.

？！

＠Reines
So we've got a fortress with a masquerade ball in a palace, an observatory over there, and a minting facility over there...
[k]

＠Reines
It's like they've taken Towers of London from different time periods and stitched them together like, well, not to put too fine a point on it, but some sort of patchwork.
[k]

？1：What's the Tower of London?

[charaFace A 1]

＠Reines
One of London's most famous World Heritage sites.
[k]

＠Reines
It started out as a fortress built by William the Conqueror, where it was called the White Tower, and was expanded upon by Richard I and Henry III.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Reines
It's been around for a very long time. At one point,[sr]it was used as a jail for royal or noble prisoners.
[k]

＠Reines
I expect that most people still think of it as a prison to this day...as the infamous Wailing Tower.
[k]

？2：William the Conqueror's fortress, right? The World Heritage site?

＠Reines
So you're familiar with it, hm? Well, it is one[sr]of the most famous buildings in all of London.
[k]

＠Reines
Most people probably think of it as a jail where they kept royal and other noble prisoners, but it's also been a palace, a bank, and even a zoo.
[k]
