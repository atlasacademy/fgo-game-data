＠Demon King Nobbu
Damn. If I'd come here as my smaller self, I might've been able to get a ticket at the kids' rate.

＠Demon King Nobbu
I guess this is what I get for growing up and filling out on all that carnival food I had at that rest stop...
[k]

？1：Where'd that come from, Demon King?

？2：Pretty sure that's not how it works...

Kai Furry Park is meant to be a place where children[sr]and animals can frolic in harmony. [bgm BGM_EVENT_3 0.1]It is the utopian[sr]dream of all Atalantes everywhere.
[k]

＠Takeda Atalante Alter
I will ensure this is a peaceful, family-friendly haven, even if I have to kill you all to do it!
