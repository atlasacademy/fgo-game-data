Unbelievable. It must be nice to be able to nap this much in the middle of the day, [%1].[wait tVoice]

You're lucky I woke you up before evening. Unless you wanted to spend the whole holiday asleep?[wait tVoice]

Are you still not fully woken up? It must be hard for you humans to not have a wake/sleep button.[wait tVoice]

＠Mk. II

Yes. “Quit it, Batty, or I'll kick your ketsu!” and “Cap! It's time for the Mazer tank!”[wait tVoice]

Hmm... You really don't look so hot. You remind me of a mailbox that's been left out in the sun for too long.[wait tVoice]

Did you dream you were being crushed by a chocolate mountain? Or about to be hanged at a chocolate gallows?[wait tVoice]

You've been getting presents from the other Servants after all, right?[wait tVoice]

＠Mk. II
[tVoice ValVoice_1000500 0_V140]
Even I can't keep track of them all. You really would make yourself sick if you ate all of them.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：It's okay. I'm used to it.

＠Mk. II
[tVoice ValVoice_1000500 0_V150]
I see. So you're one of those people who prefers regular gas over high octane. I can't say I care for that kind of quantity over quality mindset myself.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Mk. II
[tVoice ValVoice_1000500 0_V160]
You can't have more than one of something really special. Bragging about how much you got isn't a very good look.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Mk. II
[tVoice ValVoice_1000500 0_V170]
...You just thought I'm a hypocrite because I once mass-produced copies of myself, didn't you?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Mk. II
[tVoice ValVoice_1000500 0_V180]
I'm the exception that proves the rule. I'm so special that even my copies have as much value as me.[wait tVoice]

？2：I didn't actually get that many.

So you haven't gotten many. I would expect my Master to be much more popular than that.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_1000500 0_V210]
It's all because of those weird things you like. You really should do something about that fetish of yours.[wait tVoice]

I don't care about things like chocolate. They disappear much too quickly for my tastes.[wait tVoice]

＠Mk. II
[tVoice ValVoice_1000500 0_V250]
But today is a holiday, which makes this a good opportunity to give you something you need.[wait tVoice]

＠Mk. II
[tVoice ValVoice_1000500 0_V260]
You might not need it right now, but as long as you're my Master, someday you will.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Mk. II
[tVoice ValVoice_1000500 0_V270]
And when you do, I can't have you using something cheap and flimsy. That's why I took the time to design this myself.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Mk. II
[tVoice ValVoice_1000500 0_V280]
It's just the right size, and its texture and functionality are both S-class. Isn't it great?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Mk. II
[tVoice ValVoice_1000500 0_V290]
Okay then, I'll see you later. I need to check how Castle Csejte's frame is coming along.[wait tVoice]
