Good morning, [%1]. Are you here for voluntary training?[wait tVoice]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V020]
Oh, well, I just checked, and there have been no orders from the Command Room...[wait tVoice]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V030]
...so I thought you would be spending your day off by relaxing and having fun.[wait tVoice]

？1：The fun's just getting started.

Thank you, [%1]. This is a wonderful surprise.[wait tVoice]

If it were not for the other knights of the Round Table, I would be giving you a [&high five:great big hug] right about now.[wait tVoice]

Of course it is a big deal. My chivalric code demands that [&friendship:affection] be returned with [&friendship:affection].[wait tVoice]

Although...I'm afraid that does leave me at a loss.[wait tVoice]

If you were a fellow knight, I could return this favor in any number of ways, but of course, you are a mage.[wait tVoice]

Yes. I had kept it aside for my younger sister, but I have decided to give it to you, Master [%1].[wait tVoice]

Just because you are a man does not mean you have no use for cosmetics. Think of them as the sword and armor you use every day.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V190]
Once someone catches your eye, the battle has already begun. Keeping you outward appearance beautiful is what lets your inner beauty shine forth.[wait tVoice]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V200]
Yes, these cosmetics are marketed towards women, but never mind that.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V210]
All you need do is hand one of these casually, yet boldly, to the woman you're interested in.[wait tVoice]

If things should go well from there, let me know, and we will celebrate your victory while sharing our stories of romance![wait tVoice]

？！

...I see. So you mistook me for a stuffed shirt as well...[wait tVoice]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V260]
You're happy to discuss your love life with Lancelot and Tristan, but not with me... It always turns out this way...[wait tVoice]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V270]
...Ahh, this saddens me... I am a knight of the Round Table just as much as them...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V280]
If you told me you might have a chance with a beautiful maiden, I would ride Gringolet like the wind to come to your aid...[wait tVoice]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V290]
Perhaps I should have used a harp or two for my Noble Phantasm as well...[wait tVoice]

Well, all that aside, I hope you have a wonderful Valentine's Day, Master.[wait tVoice]

No matter how good Chaldea's air conditioning may be, we are still atop a freezing cold, six-thousand meter tall mountain.[wait tVoice]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V340]
Such an environment cannot possibly be good for the skin. So I want you to use these.[wait tVoice]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V350]
You may be a seasoned Master now, but you are also still a growing young lady.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V360]
I want you to tend to your heart just as one would water a flower. You mustn't forget to present yourself with care.[wait tVoice]

＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V370]
Do that, and I have no doubt you will bloom into a great beauty. Trust me, I have an eye for this sort of thing.[wait tVoice]

Our contract may be temporary, but I still swore to serve as your knight. Thus, I am prepared to do whatever it takes to keep you safe.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gawain
[tVoice ValVoice_100700 0_V430]
So I ask that you resign yourself to that fact and accept my gift. Rest assured I will continue to serve as your faithful knight, Master.[wait tVoice]
