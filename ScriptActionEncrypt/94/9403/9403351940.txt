？1：Are these...shoes?

They're a type of leather shoe called moccasins.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_501600 0_V040]
I made them myself by tanning the hide of a wild beast.[sr]They were not bought in a store.[wait tVoice]

...To be honest, they probably aren't very comfortable. You could surely find much better quality at a store, or from a cobbler.[wait tVoice]

However, Master, the most important thing about these moccasins...is that one can make them all on one's own.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_501600 0_V070]
We don't usually think about such things, but walking around barefoot is much more painful than you would think. In some case, an injured foot can even lead to one's death.[wait tVoice]

As if that weren't enough, we don't tend to walk around with a spare set of footwear. So then, what do we do if we find ourselves out in the wilds without a usable pair of shoes?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Geronimo
[tVoice ValVoice_501600 0_V090]
...We make them ourselves. At times, being able to make moccasins can be the difference between life and death.[wait tVoice]

＠Geronimo
[tVoice ValVoice_501600 0_V100]
That's why the ones I just gave you are only for reference. Now, Master, I know it is sudden notice, but would you join me in making moccasins?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Absolutely!

Hehe, I'm glad you are so eager to learn. All right, let's get started. We can even enjoy the chocolate you gave me while we work.[wait tVoice]
