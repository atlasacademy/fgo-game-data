Well, well. What a surprise to see you in my personal atelier instead of the Da Vinci Workshop.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V020]
So what brings you here? Wait, let me guess. Does it have something to do with that sweet, sweet aroma I smell?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：It sure does.
？2：Eat this!

Mmm, thanks, [%1]. This is real sweet of you, in more ways than one.[wait tVoice]

My beauty comes straight from the Mona Lisa, after all, so gender makes no difference to me.[wait tVoice]

＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V050]
Wait, maybe it did at first? Then again, maybe not? Anyway, my position might be complicated, but I know what I like.[wait tVoice]

Hmm. Now then, to thank you for warming my heart like this, you deserve the best reward I can possibly give you![wait tVoice]

Take a look! This is the secret weapon I've been working on for just such an occasion: the Omni Ornithopter Model 3![wait tVoice]

But of course! I've been making sure it would be ready to go no matter where you got sent to next![wait tVoice]

The only downside is it's got SO many functions I haven't been able to finish it yet. So in the meantime, think of this as a concept 'thopter.[wait tVoice]

＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V110]
One of these days, I'll finish it up and send it your way. And when I do, we can take it on a road trip across Italy.[wait tVoice]

Just the two of us, of course. I might not be on the same level as you, but I am a seasoned traveler in my own right.[wait tVoice]

＠Da Vinci
[tVoice ValVoice_500900 0_V130]
I promise you'll see some beautiful sights, enjoy some wonderful cuisine, and have many magnificent experiences.[wait tVoice]

Ahh, what a grand romantic trip that will be. Experiencing some genuine human emotion again sounds really nice.[wait tVoice]

Which is why you need to watch out that you don't get hurt in the meantime, [%1]![wait tVoice]

It doesn't matter how advanced civilization gets; nothing beats having a real flesh-and-blood body. As they say, where there's life, there's hope.[wait tVoice]

I might not be a doctor, but I'm still counting on you to stay healthy and hearty until the very end, okay?[wait tVoice]
