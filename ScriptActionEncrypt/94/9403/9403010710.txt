Please let me make my report[sr]on Oniland's final attraction.

[charaFace B 2]

＠B：[servantName 602900:Assassin of Paraíso:Mochizuki Chiyome]
It is the most conspicuous and popular of all Oniland's attractions, with an average wait time of no fewer than thirty minutes!

It is the largest and most powerful of all Oniland's attractions, enjoying tremendous popularity!
