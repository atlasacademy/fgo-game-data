All right, Mr. Moriarty, tell us what you found out.

＠Moriarty
Very well. May I have everyone's attention, please?
[k]

＠Moriarty
As you know, a priceless relic[sr]was stolen from this estate.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Yesterday, my apprentice and I talked to all of you on behalf of our employer, Mr. Sieg, to make sure nothing had been overlooked.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Moriarty
To leap ahead somewhat and begin with the conclusion, each of you has your own reasons for being a perfectly viable suspect.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Moriarty
Mr. Diarmuid is on the brink of retirement.[sr]Mr. Yan Qing is worried about his subordinates' future.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Mr. Izo is concerned with how the growing marine transport industry will encroach on his business.
[k]

＠Moriarty
But the one thing you all have in common...is that none of you can throw caution to the wind.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Moriarty
Should one of you step out of line,[sr]the others will devour you. So, you wait.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Moriarty
Then one day, Mr. Sieg shows up offering to let you bid on an invaluable relic. No doubt the news nearly gave you heart palpitations.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Surely, this would be the chance you have been waiting for; a chance for something to change. Am I correct so far?

Though of course, I would never do[sr]so while leaving my work unfinished.

＠Moriarty
And that brings us to my first point.
[k]

＠Moriarty
You wish to break this stalemate,[sr]so you mean to acquire the relic.
[k]

＠Moriarty
This is, however, far from the true equation.
[k]

＠Moriarty
While the three mages see it as their ticket to a surefire victory, and each wishes to get his hands on it no matter the cost...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Moriarty
...the three gang leaders don't care who gets it,[sr]for the stalemate will be broken regardless.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Moriarty
Thus, none of them have any motive to steal it.[sr]In fact, they have a clear motive NOT to.

[charaTalk G]
[charaFace G 0]
[charaFadein G 0.1 1]

[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Moriarty
...none of you are free to move any large sums around, whether from selling the relic or anything else.
[k]

＠Moriarty
I imagine that would be quite a serious problem[sr]for an organization, no? Especially yours, Mr. Izo.

[charaFace H 9]

＠Izo
If I stole that relic, you'd all only[sr]have more reason to suspect me.
[k]

[charaFadeout H 0.1]
[wt 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 0]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Moriarty
Precisely. All of this is to say that the three gang leaders each have their own reasons for wanting the auction to go ahead.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Even if Mr. Diarmuid had lost, it would give him[sr]a perfect excuse to retire, to gracefully bow out.
[k]

＠Moriarty
After all, Mr. Yan Qing's goal was only ever to ensure his subordinates would be accepted by this city.
[k]

＠Moriarty
But if either party had stolen the relic, that would cause problems that no amount of money could resolve.
[k]

＠Moriarty
As for Mr. Izo's reasons, well,[sr]we just went over those mere moments ago.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Moriarty
We would seem to be left with one of the mages,[sr]but this is just as implausible.

Indeed. After all, nobody here could be certain that they would get to keep the relic for themselves!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Moriarty
Between his and Mr. Diarmuid's funds, Mr. Alexander was quite confident in his chances at winning the auction.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Prince of Lan Ling was less sure in his bidding prospects, but he also believed he had a chance at charming the relic off of whoever did win.
[k]

＠Moriarty
As for Count Vlad, if he ended up losing the auction, he had every intention of seizing the relic by force.

Of course. Any true mage must be willing[sr]to get his hands dirty when necessary.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Vlad III
But, that willingness to use violence does[sr]not come at the expense of my good sense.
[k]

＠Vlad III
And employing that sense suggests there is nothing to be gained in stealing the relic. As such, I would never do so.

Stealing is an act of thievery.[sr]Seizing it by force is simply a noble doing what he must.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Vlad III
That is the crucial difference.

[charaFace A 0]

＠Moriarty
Every one of our guests, be they mage or gang member,[sr]had their honor on the line.
[k]

＠Moriarty
But the culprit feared letting the[sr]relic go more than he did its theft.
[k]

＠Moriarty
If he were to let it get away from him even once, everything his family had passed down for generations would be lost.
[k]

＠Moriarty
That would remain the case even if[sr]he managed to steal it back later.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Thus, the relic leaving his possession was the one thing the culprit simply couldn't bear.
