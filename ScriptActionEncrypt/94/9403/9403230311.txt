(Sigh) So that's how this guest[sr]room ended up razed to the ground.

？1：Once they started using their Noble Phantasms, well...

？！

＠Beni-Enma
Well, nothing to be done for it now. Besides, fights between gods used to be a common occurrence here.

＠Beni-Enma
But they'll still have to be punished,[sr]so we can set an example for all the others, chirp.

＠Beni-Enma
You can start by cleaning up the hot springs.[sr]That goes for all who took part in this, okay?
