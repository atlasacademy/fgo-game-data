Hmm. These attendants keep loosening up their kimono and rushing over the moment they spot us.

Well, we certainly don't have to worry about that here. Who would possibly be tempted by bizarre dolls like this!

And they're coming towards us, too. They must be trying to seduce us, just like the attendants.

The attendant dolls can only be so seductive,[sr]given what they are...

If Mata Hari and I were still under her control, we would probably have been forced to help with this as well.

We should be able to progress just by fighting them off.

Although, with the way she's looking at[sr]us...I think I can tell what's on her mind.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
She's thinking that even hurting one another can arguably be construed as a kind of foreplay...
[k]

[charaFace I 2]

＠Pārvatī
...so she WANTS us to fight her!

？1：This is the last floor. We can't stop now!

If I were in her position, I would want to keep everything for myself.
