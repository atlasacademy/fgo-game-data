...They're not here, either.[sr]Where could they be?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Is everything okay?
？2：Looking for someone?

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V050]
Hello, Master. Yes, I am looking for someone right now.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V060]
I've been looking for them since about five in the morning, but strangely, I haven't been able to find them anywhere.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V070]
Oh, to be precise, I'm looking for gods, not humans. Um, to be even more precise[line 2][wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Let me guess: your sisters?
？2：Let me guess: Stheno and Euryale?

？！

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V090]
Anyway, yes, that's right.[sr]I was really hoping to see them today.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V100]
I learned that today is Valentine's Day; a day that has special significance in today's society.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V110]
That's why some Servants and all of Chaldea's staff are so excited today, right?[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V120]
I want to use this opportunity to tell the ones I care for how I feel about them, too.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V130]
So that's why...[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Got it!
？2：Why don't we look for your sisters together then?

？！

H-huh? Are you sure?[wait tVoice]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V150]
Isn't this day important for you too, Master?[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V160]
If it is, then...I don't think you should waste it helping me. I'm sorry.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V170]
If I haven't found my sisters after all this searching, then it must mean they're hiding from me on purpose.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V180]
I don't know why. They might just be playing a prank...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V190]
...or it could be something else. Maybe it has something to do with the other Medusa engraved in the Throne...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V200]
Maybe it has something to do with the Extra class Gorgon... Or maybe it has something to do with me.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V210]
Whatever the reason might be, it's going to be very difficult to find them.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.
？2：You're plenty special to me to be worth the trouble.

...Heh?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V240]
...Wait. What? Y-you're really...talking about me?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V250]
Are you positive? I-I mean, I'm still so immature...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V260]
W-well, I guess...the way I look might be...pretty close to my perfect sisters...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V270]
B-but...we're still talking...about me, right?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medusa
[tVoice ValVoice_302700 0_V280]
My Mystic Eyes are still underdeveloped, my abilities are inferior in every way, and even my Spirit Origin isn't fully stable, so...[wait tVoice]
