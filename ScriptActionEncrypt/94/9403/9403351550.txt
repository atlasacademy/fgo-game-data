The Holy Grail has bestowed upon me a blessing...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Irisviel
[tVoice ValVoice_502000 0_V030]
A twist of fate far beyond human comprehension.[sr]Some would even call it a miracle.[wait tVoice]

Master...hehe, do you know what my blessing is?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：No idea...

＠Irisviel
[tVoice ValVoice_502000 0_V050]
Then I will tell you the answer.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：It's not your magical energy levels or Noble Phantasm, is it?

＠Irisviel
[tVoice ValVoice_502000 0_V060]
No, it is not that.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？！

＠Irisviel
[tVoice ValVoice_502000 0_V070]
A Spirit Origin capable of materializing as a Heroic Spirit? No. Magecraft talent fit for a Caster? No.[wait tVoice]

The wonderful, nigh-miraculous blessing I was given is...[wait tVoice]

...cooking teachers![wait tVoice]

？1：Now I get it!
？2：Aha! You're talking about Chaldea's kitchen Heroic Spirits!

Yes! Yes, that's right.[sr]There's Boudica, Cat...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Irisviel
[tVoice ValVoice_502000 0_V110]
Shiki, Raikou, and of course, Archer Emiya, right?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Irisviel
[tVoice ValVoice_502000 0_V120]
They all taught me so patiently.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Irisviel
[tVoice ValVoice_502000 0_V130]
It was difficult for me at first, but now, I can at least make sweets.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Irisviel
[tVoice ValVoice_502000 0_V140]
Perhaps it's thanks to my being a Holy Grail terminal? I know it's very unusual for a pure Heroic Spirit to grow or evolve...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Irisviel
[tVoice ValVoice_502000 0_V150]
Wait! Does this mean I'm naturally good with my hands, and I've always had a talent for cooking!?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：That might be it.
？2：I, uh... I guess anything's possible...?

？！

Teehee. I truly have been blessed.[sr]Now then... Master?[wait tVoice]

Please, have a look. This is my Valentine's Day gift from me to you![wait tVoice]

I tried to make it in your home country's style, while keeping the chocolate the star of the show. It's a whole cake, so please feel free to enjoy it with Mash.[wait tVoice]
