On another note, I'm very impressed by how[sr]much thought you've all put into your ideas.

＠Mash
But of course, Isidoro is a great detective, so his is bound to be just as good if not better. Right, Tristan?

They may appear to be author-blessed with special privileges, but at their heart, they have almost nothing propping them up.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Tristan
The fact that I cannot rely on drama for the conclusion like the rest of you left me at a great disadvantage.
[k]

＠Tristan
I see now that I should have been planting clues for the conclusion earlier in the story...
[k]

＠Tristan
Perhaps something that would let me claim to secretly be another character's brother, or a character everyone else thought was dead...

Given that, at this point,[sr]Isidoro is indeed a detective in name only...

[charaFace A 1]

＠Tristan
...what if it was actually Adriana who has been controlling him all along?

Then, upon revealing herself as the true detective, Adriana could identify the culprit, and that would be the end.

As long as we keep glossing over any accidents in filming the way we have been, it doesn't matter what the truth ultimately is.

I decided to try looking at[sr]things a little differently.
[k]

＠Tristan
While you've all been preoccupied with solving the Meihousou's murder mystery...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Tristan
...my case involves solving the mystery of this Hollywood Meihousou itself.
[k]

＠Tristan
In other words, we make the out of character footage itself part of the movie.

[charaTalk F]

[charaFadein F 0.1 1]

＠Ryouma
So you'd be including our own,[sr]actual confusion in the story, huh.

＠Tristan
We should arguably never have tried to film a movie without an overarching theme in mind.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Tristan
So now that we have, we could make Murasaki Shikibu's fainting incident the true mystery.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Tristan
What if her fainting wasn't actually an unfortunate accident, but only disguised to look like one?
[k]

＠Tristan
And if that were the case, who would stand to benefit from removing her from the scene?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Tristan
Does that not sound like an interesting mystery?

＠Andersen
Still, that could work for a puzzle mystery as long as you take it seriously, though you're stretching this to the breaking point.
[k]

＠Andersen
That said, you'll need to have a really good explanation, or the viewers won't accept it. What've you got?

I am very curious about Tristan's idea...

[charaFace E 13]

＠Mash
At any rate, we now have five[sr]possible endings to choose from.
[k]

＠Mash
They all sound great, but we sadly[sr]don't have time to film them all.
[k]

＠Mash
I guess things turned out just like Dr. Roman said they would... What do you say, Master?
