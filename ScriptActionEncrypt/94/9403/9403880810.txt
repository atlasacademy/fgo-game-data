＠???
Welcome! I am Nero, the greatest Roman Daimyo in all of Japan!
[k]

＠Roman Daimyo Nero
I am also the Roman Daimyo who[sr]rules the Roman Osaka Empire!
[k]

？1：Uh, Your Imperial Highness, last I checked, you're not an Alter.

？2：The greatest Roman Daimyo in Japan? ...Ow, my head...

？！

＠Roman Daimyo Nero
Umu! I was just thinking the time was right for me to gain an Alter form of my own. Think of this as an Alter test run.
[k]

＠Roman Daimyo Nero
Unfortunately, we didn't even have[sr]the budget for a palette swap!

I didn't know these Alter things were so, um, trendy.

[charaFace B 14]

＠Nagao Kagetora
Does this mean there's an Uesugi[sr]Kenshin Alter in the works as well?
[k]

＠Nagao Kagetora
Don't you think the name "Kenshin" even sounds like it would be perfect for an Alter?

Um, I think you're already pretty close to an Alter's color scheme as it is, Kagetora.

＠Roman Daimyo Nero
At any rate!
[k]

＠Roman Daimyo Nero
Now that I have come to this golden land of Zipang, I will collect its treasures and found a new Japanese Roman Empire!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Roman Daimyo Nero
Now, what was it that Rider with[sr]the funny beard told me again...?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Roman Daimyo Nero
Oh, yes! He said there is a book called “The Travels of” um...someone, which says this land has a veritable mountain of gold just waiting to be claimed!

＠Roman Daimyo Nero
Umu! The Eastern nation of Zipang, where gold adorns the land! What could be better than that!
[k]

？1：Um, I'm afraid the information in that book is kind of[line 2]Okay, mostly wrong, Your Imperial Highness.

？2：I guess there are a fair number of gold mines here, but that's all...
