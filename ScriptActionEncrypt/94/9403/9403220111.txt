Chirp, thank you so much![sr]Chirp, I can't tell you how grateful I am!

＠Sparrow
You must be famous, chirp, powerful[sr]gods to chase away monkeys like that!
[k]

＠Sparrow
Did you come here from Izumo to soak in the hot springs? Chirp, that's certainly the impression I get from the fox lady.
[k]

＠Sparrow
Chirp, are you a friend of Magistrate Tiger's, perhaps?
[k]

＠Sparrow
“Eat the things that are weaker than you.”[sr]That's the impression I get of the fox lady, chirp.

More importantly, did you just say hot springs?[sr]You wouldn't happen to work at a hotel, would you?

Oh, wait. May I ask where you all are from?[sr]Because we don't accept gang members, chirp chirp.

If you mean to stay at our inn for the purposes of testing your skills, collecting materials, or property destruction, then I can't show you the way, chirp.

Um, Master? Just to confirm, this is a pleasure trip, right? We are not here to repair a Singularity, right?

Although, it's flying so close to the ground[sr]that it doesn't seem any faster than walking...
