Hey, [%1]. Good timing. Got a minute?[wait tVoice]

I know it's what you're here to do and all, but spending all your time fighting's no way to live.[wait tVoice]

This...looks like something made with cacao beans...[sr]You're giving this to me?[wait tVoice]

？1：It's a token of my gratitude.

...Gotcha. I really ought to do something about my tendency to ramble.[wait tVoice]

I meant to give this to you first, but you went and beat me to the punch.[wait tVoice]

Right. Today's that sort of day, isn't it. I'm glad to see my contracted Master is in such high demand.[wait tVoice]

I speak from experience on that. I can even teach you a little secret for keeping the peace later. But I digress.[wait tVoice]

Don't worry, it's for pretty much the same reasons as yours. No need to brace yourself.[wait tVoice]

Hey, it'd be boring to just give you food back in return, right? I gave it a lot of thought, and decided this was what you needed most.[wait tVoice]

They're all made for beginners, and the knife'll even blare an alert if it looks like you might cut your finger.[wait tVoice]

The time when cooking was thought to only be women's work is gone. You never know when knowing how to cook will be helpful, and it makes your day to day life richer, too.[wait tVoice]

I was only going to give you the pot at first, but as I kept thinking about it, it grew into a full set of cookware.[wait tVoice]

Feel free to chalk that up to my overprotective nature. It's been a long time since I gave anyone a gift, after all.[wait tVoice]
