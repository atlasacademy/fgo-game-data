Good grief. Anyway, Gray here's an acquaintance of mine. Though I had no idea she'd become a Servant, too.

That's right. I was enrolled at the Clock[sr]Tower as Lord El-Melloi II's apprentice.

Um... Reines told me what happened to him.
[k]


？1：I'm so sorry for your loss.

...I want to find out what happened to my mentor.[sr]If I can't do that, there's no point in my being here.

＠Reines
While we're at it, I have something else to tell you.[sr]I haven't officially confirmed this yet, but...
[k]

＠Reines
...between the scales and her talk about passing judgment, I'm positive the Divine Spirit possessing Luvia is Astraea.
[k]

？1：Astraea?

[bgm BGM_EVENT_79 0.1]

＠Reines
The divine incarnation of justice in Greek mythology.
[k]

？2：That's the Greek goddess of justice, right?

[bgm BGM_EVENT_79 0.1]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Reines
Exactly. In Greek mythology, history was divided into several ages: The Golden, Silver, Bronze, Heroic, and Iron Ages.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Reines
Astraea spent her days living among humans and fiercely advocating for justice until the very last Iron Age.
[k]

？！

＠Reines
She's basically one of the progenitors[sr]for the concept of Lady Justice.

Our information confirms that too.[sr]Reines's theory is almost certainly correct.

Astraea... To think we'd come this far only to find[sr]a Divine Spirit Pseudo-Servant standing in our way.

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_79 1.0]

＠Reines
It's not all bad news though.[sr]Now we have a real shot at victory.
[k]

？1：We do?

？！

[bgm BGM_EVENT_77 0.1]

＠Reines
You bet. Gray's Noble Phantasm should have[sr]no trouble getting through Astraea's defenses.
[k]

？1：Really!?
？2：You know what her Noble Phantasm can do?

？！

[charaFace C 6]

＠Reines
Oh sure. Gray's always had hers, even when[sr]she was alive. ...Wait. Are you an Assassin?

Oh, and by Sealing, I mean I keep my goods sealed away most of the time. Sometimes I change shape so Gray here can use me as a weapon, though.

Um, likewise... I'm so relieved. Since I wasn't able to go there with Senpai, I've been thinking about other times I've had to stay behind.
[k]

＠Mash
I'm so glad [&he:she] managed to find such[sr]dependable allies during this Rayshift.
[k]


[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
Oh, we've managed to improve our monitoring fidelity,[sr]so I'm analyzing that paper you found as we speak.
[k]

＠Mash
One thing we've already learned is that...there appear to be other, tinier scraps of that paper scattered throughout Patchwork London.
[k]

？1：There are?
？2：How are these scraps different from the ones we've found?

？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
These scraps emit an identical energy signature[sr]to the paper you found, but on a much smaller scale.
[k]

＠Mash
If you can, I'd like you to collect as many of[sr]those as you can, along with the Mnemosyne ones.
[k]

＠Mash
In the meantime, I promise I'll do everything[sr]I can to help you out from here!

＠Reines
All right then, let's go see what[sr]this latest patchwork is like.
[k]


＠Reines
Seeing how she tried to take it from us, I'm guessing Luvia[line 2]Astraea, is after those scraps of paper, too.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Reines
I don't know what she's up to, but whatever it is,[sr]we're bound to run into each other again at some point.
