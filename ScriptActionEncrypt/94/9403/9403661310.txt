＠D：???
Yes, that Divine Spirit was the only true obstacle[sr]in my way. So I took the liberty of removing her.
[k]


＠D：???
Though of course, I doubt it would have[sr]been so easy were she still in top form.
[k]

＠D：???
Fortunately, the memories of the Demon God[sr]Pillars did their job of softening her up.
[k]

？1：Astraea in top form could have stopped you?
？2：That's the whole reason you recreated those memories?

？！

＠D：???
I knew Astraea would be the greatest threat[sr]to me as soon as I learned of her existence.
[k]

＠D：???
That's why I went to the trouble of falsifying memories of a battle fierce enough to eliminate her.
[k]

＠D：???
Those paper scraps are indeed the byproduct of that reproduction, as that Pseudo-Servant there surmised.
[k]

＠D：???
I was hoping you would all fall in that battle along with her, but instead you emerged victorious.
[k]

＠D：???
So now...
[k]

＠D：???
...I would like all of you to go away,[sr]with the exception of [%1].

＠Mnemosyne
So, you even managed to deduce my name.
[k]

[charaFace E 7]

＠Mnemosyne
Yes, that's right. I'm the subsystem that was created to verify a Master's existence during a Rayshift.
[k]

？1：You're the existence verification subsystem?
？！

[charaFace E 0]

＠Mnemosyne
The reason a Master is able to continue living during[sr]Rayshifts is because someone is constantly observing[sr]and verifying [&his:her] existence.
[k]

＠Mnemosyne
Initially, Chaldea also had a backup existence verification subsystem designed to prevent a Master from disappearing in the event that all the personnel meant to observe them were somehow indisposed.
[k]

＠Mnemosyne
But it...or rather, I, was never implemented,[sr]in consequence of some sort of technical issue.
