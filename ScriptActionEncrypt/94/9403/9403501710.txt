Whenever there's a holiday, or a party, or some other special occasion, it's the otsugi's job to liven it up! Though I'm not entirely sure why that is!

I don't think I would ever have chosen them to be otsugi myself if they insisted on wearing those, no matter how talented they might be.

The Ooku's attendants are devoted solely[sr]to serving the shogun and his wife.
