When Chaldea regained the ability to Rayshift,[sr]I found a Holy Grail fragment not too far away.

＠Mnemosyne
So I used the Holy Grail fragment to create three pieces of paper, lured you to them, and had you steal the memories they held.
[k]

？1：So that's why everyone had forgotten...

？！

＠Mnemosyne
It was what I had to do to create new memories[sr]and have you more easily accept them.

＠Mnemosyne
Just giving them to you wouldn't have been enough. I had to create obstacles for you to overcome, to make you work to collect them.
