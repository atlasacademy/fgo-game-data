Well, of course! I mean, I'm working side[sr]by side with Master at a hot springs inn!

That is what you're getting at, isn't it, Tomoe!?[sr]I couldn't agree more!

If we don't speed things up soon, our pig-ification[sr]is all but assured! Start innovating, and fast!

Director Goredolf is right.[sr]Can you think of anything that might help us, Senpai?

That's true... We'll never be able[sr]to get offerings without guests.

And we can't just go back to Chaldea until we've managed to lift the curse...

Y-yes, exactly! It's still too[sr]soon to ask Chaldea for help!
[k]

[charaFace E 11]

＠Goredolf
Besides, the communicator's been,[sr]er...acting up a bit, anyway.
[k]

＠Goredolf
But no matter. As long as I'm here, we have no need to seek Sion or Da Vinci or anyone else's advice.
[k]

？2：I say we call Chaldea and ask for help.

Now, now, let's, uh, not be hasty. Calling them now would do nothing to resolve this problem.
[k]

＠Goredolf
Besides, just imagine what would happen if we returned to Chaldea now while we are essentially cursed.
[k]

＠Goredolf
“Well, on to the next Lostbelt!” “Say, didn't something happen at New Year's? ...Oops.”
[k]

[charaFace E 16]

＠Goredolf
And then, bam![sr]We're all suddenly one big herd of swine!
[k]

＠Goredolf
Trust me, I know all about these[sr]sorts of accursed situations!
[k]

[charaFace E 6]

＠Goredolf
Therefore, I'm exercising my authority to prohibit all communicator usage until this problem is resolved!
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

＠Goredolf
Now never mind all that! The real issue is that there aren't any guests at this bloody inn!

＠Diarmuid
True. The only other guests we've seen here are those who have been staying at the Enma-tei for years.

They may well be giving offerings[sr]every day, but even so...

＠Mash
Yes... It's inevitable that their gratitude would fade as their life here becomes routine.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
The Enma-tei may be a beautiful inn, but it does seem to have trouble attracting new guests.
[k]

＠Mash
The whole building is immaculately well-kept,[sr]but it also feels...lonely.
[k]

＠Mash
I wonder why things ended up this way...

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Quite. It is undeniably strange that such a miraculous inn would be so bereft of visitors...
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
...but we can, and should,[sr]save that discussion for another time.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_81 1.0]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Especially since our path forward is now clear.
[k]

？1：It is?

[charaFace G 1]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_62 0.1]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Absolutely.[sr]You said it yourself, Master.
[k]

？2：Sure is.

[charaFace G 1]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_62 0.1]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Indeed. Now that we know what the problem is,[sr]we can set about fixing it.
[k]

？！

[charaFace G 0]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
If there are no new guests coming to stay,[sr]we need merely go and find some.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
This inn may be normally inaccessible to humans, but we have quite the surplus of nonhuman acquaintances.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
All we need do is draw upon our bonds, and we should have Heroic Spirits coming here one after the other.

＠Goredolf
I see. Headhunting, but for[sr]guests instead of employees.
[k]

＠Goredolf
Still, isn't there a limit to how many Servants you could attract here with your bonds alone?

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 0]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Mash
Yes. Even if we assume the Wandering Sea Chaldea Base can produce as much magical energy as Chaldea...
[k]

＠Mash
...we would still only be able to Rayshift one,[sr]maybe two more Servants to this Singularity.
[k]

＠Mash
What's more...they would need to come here with Master.
[k]

＠Mash
And since we can't return to Chaldea right now,[sr]I don't believe it's possible to summon from there.
[k]

＠Mash
So our only choice is to have them come[sr]directly from the Throne of Heroes...
[k]

＠Mash
...but in order to do that, we would need power equivalent to a Holy Grail.

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Which is exactly why it will work, Mash. The Enma-tei naturally attracts all sorts of spirits, right?
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Then by definition, this whole inn must[sr]function as a summoning location.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mash
Oh!
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
So how do we get more guests?[sr]Simple: attention-grabbing advertising.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
We tell prospective guests that if they come here...
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
...they will find wonderful food,[sr]scenery, and service, in equal measure.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
And once the Enma-tei starts to thrive again, word of mouth will spread and the more curious Heroic Spirits will be compelled to come stay for themselves.

？！

[charaFace G 1]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Hahaha. Thank you for putting[sr]into words what I could not.

If that's what you want, Master, I have no objections.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
That said, we will need to talk to Ms. Beni and get her permission. I'll handle that part.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
After all, if we're going to make suggestions about how to run the inn itself...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...in addition to all the yardwork, culinary work, cleaning, and fixing up empty rooms...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...that goes well beyond what most people would consider to be a part-time job.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Now let's see...why don't we start with renovating one of the sealed-off guest rooms?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
We certainly can't go around attracting guests if we don't have a place for them to stay.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
As they say, you have to walk before you can run.[sr]Or clean before you can entertain, in this case♡

[charaFace E 10]

＠Goredolf
Very well then, we now know what it is we must do.
[k]

＠Goredolf
[%1], the first order of business[sr]is to make the guest rooms usable.
[k]

＠Goredolf
This may be a small step for you, but it will be a giant leap for me. Specifically, for ensuring I remain as I am.
[k]

[charaFace E 15]

＠Goredolf
Go on then, get to work, [&boy:girl]![sr]I'll be here to support you as best I can!
