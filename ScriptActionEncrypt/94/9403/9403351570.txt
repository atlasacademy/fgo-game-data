I also heard it began as an ancient Western festival, and a saint was involved at some point, but that's what it boils down to now.[wait tVoice]

Right, I expect it's one of those. A day of celebration where one expresses the gratitude one normally keeps to one's self. No doubt it's a grand festival of some sort.[wait tVoice]
