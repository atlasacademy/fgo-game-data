Thank you for coming, Master.[wait tVoice]

Yes, that's right. Today is Valentine's Day.[wait tVoice]

However, I'm not the least bit worried.[wait tVoice]

Master, you have won the hearts of countless Servants to date.[wait tVoice]

The thought that you might not receive anything in the way of chocolate or other gifts never even crossed my mind.[wait tVoice]

Good. I will begin our simulated battle.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V090]
I would ask that you use this Mystic Code,[sr]and summon these three Servants.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V100]
And these are the three Servants I will be using.[sr]As you can guess, we are allowed up to three mistakes.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V110]
Now, let's get started![wait tVoice]

Nicely done.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：I was so close...

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V160]
That's true. In other words, you made four mistakes before the end.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：That was too close for comfort...

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V170]
True, you did make three mistakes.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V180]
But I believe that falls within the acceptable margin of error.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？！

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V190]
Regardless, luck can at times be as much of a factor as skill.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V200]
Ideally, one would make no more than three mistakes,[sr]but four is certainly enough too.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V210]
Besides, you were at a disadvantage from the beginning, thanks to the Servants I assigned you.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V220]
And not just in terms of class, but in your Servants' particular traits as well.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V230]
For example, this territory is open with many hills...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V240]
No matter how good their Presence Concealment may be,[sr]an Assassin will inevitably have the odds stacked against them.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V250]
The Assassin in your party was quite powerful, but you weren't able to take full advantage of their strengths, were you?[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V260]
That's right. That Assassin requires an urban environment for their skills to truly shine.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V270]
If you had lured me toward that city over there,[sr]you would have made one mistake fewer.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：I see...
？！

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V280]
You must stay calm and focus on the larger picture before making a move.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V290]
No opponent is unbeatable, and no being is invincible.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V300]
No matter how powerful an enemy may seem to be,[sr]there will always be some way to wear them down.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V310]
That is all I can teach you.[sr]I hope you liked my gift, Master.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Thank you!
？！

[charaFace A 3]
＠Chiron
[tVoice ValVoice_203000 0_V320]
Not at all. I only wish I could have given you something better...[wait tVoice]
