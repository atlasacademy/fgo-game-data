＠Narration
Our story begins in the Kingdom of Nadai Nadha, a tiny Caribbean nation. Its founder, the first king, was beloved by all his people.
[k]

＠Narration
But over generations, the royal family's reputation diminished. Poor governing tore the nation apart, and the people of the nation ceased to revere their king.
[k]

＠Narration
As the situation worsened, the people came to desire[sr]a democracy, and so formed a militia for the revolution.
[k]

＠Narration
The king turned a deaf ear to their pleas, though. Instead, he elected to remain in his palace and enjoy his life of luxury.
[k]

＠Narration
In consequence, the revolutionaries gained more and more power, fueled by the people's grievances.

I have no intention of refusing to acknowledge reality, but I also know that your army was quite determined to take advantage of the situation.

[charaFace B 5]

＠Ryu
So I thought you could at least serve as a scarecrow[sr]of sorts, and draw the rebels' attention away.
[k]

＠Ryu
Then, while your forces and theirs stared each other down, my soldiers could strike at them from behind.
[k]

＠Miguel
A clever plan, General Tan. Just what I would expect from you. That sort of thinking is exactly why I had to stay one step ahead of you.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Ryu
Well, you succeeded. I never dreamed you would come to kill me in my sleep. Now my army is destroyed thanks to your ambush.

[charaFace B 2]

But what will you do now? I can't imagine you think you'll hold back the rebel army with your forces alone.

That's your problem right there, General Tan. You're too earnest for your own good. As a matter of fact, I've already reached an understanding with the rebels.

Once they have conquered the palace, I'm to be the new government's representative. They have no more desire for senseless bloodshed than I do, after all.

García acquitted himself okay, but Vargas seems like he had no idea how to properly behave.
[k]

[charaFace E 7]

＠Antonio
And here I had to pull every string[sr]I could just to get an invitation.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

＠Antonio
I wouldn't normally expect to run into people like that in a place like this...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Elise
Maybe they stole someone else's invite then.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]

＠Antonio
Hmm. I suppose they could just be going by García and Vargas to match the names on a stolen invitation.
[k]

[charaFace E 8]

＠Antonio
But what would they hope to achieve by sneaking[sr]in here? Maybe they're after Cortés's legacy?
[k]

＠Elise
Maybe they're after Gabriela. She must've had[sr]it rough, having to marry that geezer and all.
[k]

＠Elise
Who could blame her for wanting to have fun with some new boy toys now? They both have a nice tan, and they look healthy enough to keep her...entertained for a good long time.

[charaFace E 7]

＠Antonio
...You really must learn to hold your tongue. This is why everyone says you should just stick to singing.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Elise
Yeah, yeah. So who're those weirdos? They look totally out of place too, though for pretty different reasons.
