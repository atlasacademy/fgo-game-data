And now, the two of us have run into each other purely by coincidence! A very fortunate, convenient coincidence![wait tVoice]

Doesn't this feel like destiny to you!? Not that you're anything more to me than another one of my contracted Masters, of course![wait tVoice]

Yes, it certainly is. It makes me sad, seeing how abysmally plain your room is compared to mine.[wait tVoice]

I distinctly remember warning you to that effect, and you still have yet to so much as open a catalog. I used to worry about you, but now I just feel slighted![wait tVoice]

Everyone has things they're good at and things they aren't, after all. Which is why I'm presenting you with this.[wait tVoice]

＠Cleopatra
[tVoice ValVoice_600800 0_V150]
I gave it lots and lots of thought, and decided this would be the perfect gift for you: blessings from the Nile, sure to brighten up even the dullest prison cell of a room![wait tVoice]

You were saying “When giving a valentine, the ball lies in the receiver's court, not the giver's”...[wait tVoice]

But if that's the case, then there's no issue whatsoever. As the kitty said, the ball is now in your court, after all.[wait tVoice]

That's right. I want you to escort me to a place with a view grand enough to enjoy these fruits properly.[wait tVoice]
