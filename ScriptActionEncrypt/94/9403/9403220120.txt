Thank you, Sparrow. Um, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell us your name, please?

Chirp chirp, my name? It's Toshi.

＠Sparrow
You'd really call me by my name?[sr]Chirp, are you benevolent gods?

I see, chirp. Then you're lost humans who wandered here by mistake, since gods don't like using names.

＠Mash
It's a pleasure to meet you, Toshi. I've never been to an inn before, so this is all very exciting for me!

Welcome to the Enma-tei, chirp, honored guests.

The Enma-tei is a hot springs inn where all inhuman creatures are equally welcome; a place humans can only find by losing their way.

I used to help Mother with Children's Limbo, chirp, but one thing led to another, and I eventually took over the Enma-tei.

Come to think of it, I do believe that I'd heard you were running an inn now. I'm so very...very pleased to run into you again like this. Hohoho.

You had a long way to go to just master the basics.[sr]Have you eliminated the bad habits in your prep time?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Tomoe Gozen
Y-yes, of course! It's just like you taught me: rinse raw veggies well to instantly bring out their flavor!
[k]

[charaFace F 10]

＠Beni-Enma
...(Sigh) In a way, I suppose that's impressive. I guess a little rinse is all it takes to make anything edible for you.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Boar meat, tree roots, rock salt...you would just dump it all on the plate as is. Chirp chirp, perhaps you should consider renaming that “dish” to Raw Gozen?

O-oh, right! I'm sorry! Before I serve,[sr]I should cut everything in half so it's easier to eat!

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Oh yes. Ms. Beni-Enma is an incredibly skilled chef. She can wield a cooking knife as well as a first-class swordmaster wields a blade!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Once she pulls out her sword, she can cut any tongue down to size no matter how skilled an orator it belongs to. It's the quickest, smallest, shortest sword-drawing technique in the world!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
And it's exactly what makes Beni-Enma's Jigoku Kitchen the scariest place in the world to learn how to cook!

Hehe. Its full name is actually Enjaku Saihou Battoujutsu. It means “Hell Sparrow Sewing Sword-Drawing Technique.”

It's not clear whether she became an expert swordsparrow thanks to her cooking, or an expert chef thanks to her swordsmanship...
[k]

...but the bottom line is that Ms. Beni-Enma's battoujutsu is so fearsome, it's enough to make even the King of Hell[line 2]the Supreme Judge's hair stand on end.
