As for me, I'm the greatest Caster that ever[sr]was or will be. Please, call me Mister Sheep.

＠Mister Sheep
I have to say, though... That was a great show.

＠Mister Sheep
Regrets from the youthful days he can never go back to... Repentance in his twilight years... Homesickness...

Ah, what's the harm? There's plenty more where that came from, right? Why not just go ahead and use them all on me?
