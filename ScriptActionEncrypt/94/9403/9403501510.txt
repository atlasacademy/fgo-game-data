＠Kama
Oh great...you took the honest route here.[sr]You lot really are hopeless, aren't you?
[k]

＠Kama
Why couldn't you let the attendants do their job? You could have been here in no time if you'd just let them show you the way.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Kama
But, that's okay. This doesn't change how I feel about you. I still hate you now just as much as before.
[k]

＠Kama
Isn't it reassuring, knowing that no matter what you do, nothing about me or how I feel will change? Now don't worry, and enjoy the journey.

Oh, right, you think I'm a liar, don't you? Never mind that I've been telling you the truth this whole time.

＠Kama
Once a Goody Two-shoes, always a Goody Two-shoes, huh, Pārvatī? Well, you're right, as usual. Ugh, you make me sick.

I already know you hate me.[sr]All right, I'll be more direct then.

[charaFace C 5]
＠Pārvatī
Is this about me? Did you turn everyone from Edo Castle and Chaldea into building materials for this Ooku...
[k]

＠Pārvatī
...just so you could get back at me?

＠Kama
Are you serious? You are, aren't you? Ugh, you're even more of a goody-goody nitwit than I thought.

＠Kama
I guess you pretty goddesses really do think the world revolves around you, huh? What a joke.

I-I didn't think it was likely![sr]I know how preposterous it sounds!
[k]

＠Pārvatī
But I had to check just to make sure, all right!?
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Pārvatī
Anyway...if that's not the case,[sr]then that clears up one thing.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
You aren't here so you can get back at me...which must mean that I'm here only because you are.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
...Whatever it is you're up to, something is telling me I have to put a stop to it.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
So I'll ask you one more time.[sr]What are you up to?
[k]

？1：Why did you make this Ooku!?
？2：Why did you abduct everyone!?
？！

＠Kama
If I had make things real simple[line 2]well, I guess I do for you guys[line 2]and boil it down to whether I'm a good or bad girl...I'd say I'm a bad girl.

Really, I'm just lazy. I can barely[sr]work up the energy to do anything.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Kama
That's why I'm not even going to try and stop you now.
[k]

＠Kama
Our paths just happened to cross here, that's all.[sr]By all means, keep doing what you're doing.

Last time, you said your goal was to have[sr]us wander this labyrinth for eternity.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
But now, you're letting us make our way to the next floor out of the goodness of you heart!
[k]

[charaFace D 8]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
...Why, it's almost as if you want us to penetrate all the way to the deepest, innermost chamber of this labyrinth.

You do need a proper welcome at these major junction points, after all, so I'm putting others in charge of that.

This is the Ooku; an inner chamber kept away from the surface. An isolated nighttime paradise that never sees the light of day.
[k]

＠Kama
I would be an abject failure as a host if I couldn't make sure its guests were properly entertained.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Kama
Now go on, my attendants. These poor, pitiful humans are being kept down by meaningless nonsense thanks to Fumougokai, the precept which forbids lying.
[k]

＠Kama
Go on and let them experience the Ooku's full and unbridled pleasures for themselves!
