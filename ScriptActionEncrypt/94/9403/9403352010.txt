Oh, Master.[sr]What can I do for you?[wait tVoice]

？1：What was that about?
？2：Did she just give you a valentine?

Indeed she did, much to my chagrin.[wait tVoice]

Valentines are meant to be a mutual exchange of gifts...[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_102000 0_V060]
...but unfortunately, I have nothing to give in return. All I can do is express my heartfelt thanks. Though, perhaps...[wait tVoice]

？1：Perhaps?

Perhaps a single, beautiful flower would suffice?[wait tVoice]

？1：Works for me!

You are far too kind to an old boor like myself. Very well, allow me to gift you with this flower in return.[wait tVoice]

It's an iris.[wait tVoice]

I'm told that in flower language, it means “hope” and “good news.”[wait tVoice]

＠Lancelot
[tVoice ValVoice_102000 0_V130]
So I thought it would suit you.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_102000 0_V150]
Hahaha, I'm delighted to hear that. [wt 0.8][charaFace A 0]But, please don't grieve for it if it should die.[wait tVoice]

Thank you, Master.[sr]However, all flowers die eventually.[wait tVoice]

Chocolate may disappear once it has been eaten, but the affection it signifies is eternal.[wait tVoice]

Flowers are no different. Our bond is deeper now thanks to this moment.[wait tVoice]

＠Lancelot
[tVoice ValVoice_102000 0_V190]
Even if the flower should die, that will never change.[wait tVoice]

Now then, Master, I would like to go partake in this chocolate.[wait tVoice]
