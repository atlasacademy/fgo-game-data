Because one way or another...we absolutely have to keep going.

I think it's a question of who exactly steals the keys and breaks the precept.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Master doing so is probably the most dangerous option, followed by having one of [&his:her] Servants do so in [&his:her] stead.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_81 1.0]
