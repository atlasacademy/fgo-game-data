This is not the original Cursed Book. It's a separate book that was given some of the stolen chocolate resources.

So, the Cursed Book can use the magical energy it absorbed to make copies itself. Then, if we don't do something...

Yes. It won't stop until every book in the library has been similarly cursed.

[charaFace A 5]

But, if we can recover the original Cursed Book, we should be able to neutralize all of the copies with a single recovery ritual!
