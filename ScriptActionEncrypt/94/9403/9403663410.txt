There aren't many humans left in the world. I have killed so many of them. I've had enough sensation of the flesh.

Looks like it to me. This monk guy must've sacrificed himself to take someone else's place.

Was your journey so easy that you never had to make any sacrifices? If these recreations are to work from a logical perspective, then of course something like this had to happen.
