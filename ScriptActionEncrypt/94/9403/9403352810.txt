Now that you mention it, I do recall hearing Chaldea's staff discussing something like that. Yes. It is part of my database.[wait tVoice]

As I recall, Valentine's is a holiday in which we give gifts meant to represent our feelings.[wait tVoice]

That's right. I should have realized sooner.[wait tVoice]

Yes. They are dumplings. I believe they should be a proper gift.[wait tVoice]

＠Danzo
[tVoice ValVoice_603000 0_V220]
These are Fuuma Dumplings X; a jewel of a food item that the entire Fuuma clan worked hard to create.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Danzo
[tVoice ValVoice_603000 0_V230]
I then took the liberty of improving on them further.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Danzo
[tVoice ValVoice_603000 0_V240]
Each one provides an entire day's worth of energy, and is said to give you the strength of a hundred people.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Danzo
[tVoice ValVoice_603000 0_V250]
To put it in more modern terms, they are rich in protein, vitamins, and calories alike.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Danzo
[tVoice ValVoice_603000 0_V260]
As long as you eat these dumplings, you will never go hungry, and your entire body will brim with energy.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Danzo
[tVoice ValVoice_603000 0_V270]
You could even use them to temporarily increase your magical energy.[wait tVoice]

？1：Wow!

[charaFace A 1]

＠Danzo
[tVoice ValVoice_603000 0_V280]
Thank you. Yes, they are an amazing food.[wait tVoice]

I am very proud of the work we did on their creation and further refinement.[wait tVoice]

I have nothing in the way of taste buds, so it is difficult for me to say...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Danzo
[tVoice ValVoice_603000 0_V330]
The other Fuuma were thrilled at my improvements to the dumplings, but in regards to their taste...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Danzo
[tVoice ValVoice_603000 0_V340]
...everyone refused to comment...[wait tVoice]
[k]



＠Danzo
[tVoice ValVoice_603000 0_V350]
Of course, I paid close attention to their health effects, but I never even stopped to consider the taste once...[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_603000 0_V360]
So it may be that, well...[wait tVoice]
