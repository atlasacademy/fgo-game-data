Gonroku had changed so much since I last saw[sr]him that I was honestly a little scared...
[k]

＠Oda Nobukatsu
...but he turned out to be no problem at all!

＠Oda Nobukatsu
Though he certainly gave us all quite a bit of trouble up to this point, didn't he?

Still, maybe I went a little too far. He might be kind of a simpleton, but he's not a bad guy...

I... I did turn my back on Lady Nobunaga once...
[k]

＠Shibata the Demon
It may have only been a single lapse of judgment, but there was indeed a time when I failed to put my faith in her!
[k]

＠Shibata the Demon
But that...
[k]

＠Shibata the Demon
That is exactly why...I so fervently wished to serve Lady Nobunaga now...!
[k]

＠Shibata the Demon
After she died, and that damn Monkey took over...!
[k]

＠Shibata the Demon
I couldn't stand to see him run[sr]the Oda clan into the ground!
[k]

＠Shibata the Demon
But then...my cowardice led to Lady Oichi's death too!
