＠A：???
“If it only could be like this.” “If only I'd done that.” Nobody makes it through life without having such thoughts at least once.

Given that failure is an inevitable part of life,[sr]there is no sense dwelling on it.

＠A：???
It's all well and good to have regrets.

＠A：???
But if you try to rid yourself of them, there will[sr]be hell to pay like you cannot even begin to fathom.

I'll come right to the point then![sr]We are lost in this Rayshift, you and I!

We have no way to ask for help,[sr]nor any means to receive it.

We are currently in a mansion[sr]found in a certain European city.
[k]

＠Moriarty
It is the late nineteenth century, though without[sr]a newspaper, I cannot be certain of the date.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Our cover story is that you and I are[sr]bartenders employed at this mansion.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Are you with me so far?

Let's leave the bar for the moment and[sr]take a stroll around the mansion itself.

Oh, and as a rule of thumb, I would strongly advise you to keep your voice low and not speak to anyone.

Diarmuid may not look the part, but I trust you can sort of see it with the other two, no?

As for Diarmuid, I imagine he was chosen because his looks and attributes are similar to those of the man he's standing in for.

Diarmuid's group has been based in this area for many years now, a gang with a long tradition.
[k]

＠Moriarty
They have their hands in every single one of this city's dark dealings and secrets, but they're also considered a pillar of the community.

Then, about twenty years ago, Yan Qing's gang came along and put paid to that peaceful state of affairs.
[k]

＠Moriarty
As soon as they came into the city, they were very aggressive about taking on whatever dirty work they could find...
[k]

＠Moriarty
...including the type of jobs that Diarmuid's gang had long refused even to touch.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Naturally, this led to turf war after turf war, with both sides gunning for each other around the city.
[k]

＠Moriarty
That state of affairs continued for several years until about three years ago, when both sides decided to put an end to these killings and came to terms.

Oh? You seem puzzled by something.[sr]Well, I suppose I can't blame you.

[charaFace A 2]

Unfortunately, that's easier said than done!

＠Moriarty
You see, each of the three gangs has[sr]something unique holding them back.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Moriarty
Indeed, eliminating the weakest opposition is a classic for a reason.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Moriarty
But in this case, each of the three gangs has something unique keeping them safe, even as it holds them back.

Diarmuid's group has numbers on their side,[sr]and they're also the ones most entrenched in the city.
[k]

＠Moriarty
But in this case, that strength is also a weakness.
[k]

＠Moriarty
As long as he remains here, Diarmuid needs to keep up his image of a chivalrous man about town.
[k]

＠Moriarty
That makes his group old and staid, unable to make the bold moves necessary to remove the others.

Good.[sr]Because it only gets more complicated from here!

[charaFace A 1]

Very well, let's see if we can't make it simpler...

Diarmuid controls the biggest gang,[sr]Yan Qing the medium-sized one...
