Hm? That's a Difference Engine, one of the very first computers ever made! That must be Babbage's backup system. And in that case...

Good, the data on the person who took the paper from the steam engine is still here! Let me just pull up the images here...

No, wait. The fact that there was a Mnemosyne paper here in the first place must mean...

Shit! [messageShake 0.02 4 4 0.2]I get it now! THIS is what Sir Babbage forgot![bgm BGM_MAP_6 0.1][sr]We've had this all backwards!
[k]


＠Reines
Whoever's behind this hasn't been stealing memories to make people forget! Stealing memories is only a means to an end!
[k]

＠Reines
This whole place consumes memories for energy!
[k]



？1：So, it's a giant memory engine?
？2：Is that even possible?

？！


[charaFace A 5]

＠Reines
In magecraft, information IS energy.
[k]

＠Reines
It's why spells and chants can be used to control magecraft in the first place.
[k]

＠Reines
If you gather enough energy like this,[sr]you could do almost anything you want with it.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Reines
Still...you don't really get much energy from memories, whether they're coming from spirits or the living.
[k]



＠Reines
I don't see how you could power a big steam engine like that on just memories...

Um, well... I have noticed that the dead spirits here have much more magical energy than usual. So did the ones in the Tower of London.
[k]

＠Gray
And those scraps of paper have even more.

I see. Then it's not just that steam engine.
[k]

＠Reines
This whole place is unusual.
[k]

＠Reines
There's something about this Singularity that makes memories an extremely potent energy source!
[k]




[charaFace A 2]

＠Reines
Oh no! No, [messageShake 0.02 4 4 0.2]no, no! No wonder they went after my brother[sr]then! I should have realized this ages ago!

＠Reines
Dammit! This backup subsystem is working independently from Sir Babbage!
[k]

＠Reines
That must be why it went after my brother! They wanted to get back the Mnemosyne paper for the energy it has.
[k]

＠Reines
Argh, no wonder those first automata[sr]we ran into looked like antiques!
[k]

＠Reines
They were impossible steam-powered models[sr]that must have come from this patchwork!
[k]

＠Reines
And if we're being tracked now, more automata[sr]like that are bound to come after us again!
[k]

＠Reines
Come on! We need to get back to my brother's flat!
