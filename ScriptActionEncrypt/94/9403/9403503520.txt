You probably don't remember this, Kasuga-no-Tsubone,[sr]but I showed you a lovely dream when we first met.

＠Kama
I put them there expressly to[sr]help make your journey easier.

[charaFace A 17]
＠Kama
You were already falling further and further into depravity, [%1]. Now that you've used the last shogun's power, you've fallen even further.
[k]

＠Kama
The whole concept of the shogun represents everything Tokugawa stands for.
[k]

＠Kama
So now that you've used every Tokugawa as your personal toy, you've fallen that much deeper into depravity.
[k]

＠Kama
And since only a fellow Tokugawa could toy with the supreme authority that the Tokugawa family holds, you must be a Tokugawa yourself.

[charaFace A 7]
