＠Moriarty
I won't say it's the best of all worlds, but I do think it will let us avoid the worst possible scenario.

All you need to do is make me the lead actor!

I'm sure Holmes would be none too pleased about this,[sr]so let me be perfectly clear up front.

What I propose is not born from[sr]a desire to play the lead...

[k]

＠Moriarty
I merely believe that making me the lead actor will neatly resolve the problem currently eating away at you.
