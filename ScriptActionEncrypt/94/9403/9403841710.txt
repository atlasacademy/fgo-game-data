Now I see. That thing really is a monster on par with the gods. No... It's pretty much a god in its own right by now.

So this is why so many of me were summoned here:[sr]to bring this thing down.

Enemy of all living creatures? Why yes, that's exactly what I am. For I am the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven.

...No, even the Sixth Heaven fails to fully capture what I've become.

Indeed, I'm supplying them with all the magical energy necessary. Don't worry, I'm paying the cost for it myself.

It may be a little damaged,[sr]but it still works perfectly well.
