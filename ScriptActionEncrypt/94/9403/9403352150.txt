Welcome to my room![wait tVoice]

Who needs another boring old room just like all the others? Not this author![wait tVoice]

And now you're here to tease me about my writing, [%1]? Talk about poor taste![wait tVoice]

Unfortunately for you, my creative efforts are all on ice right now! Go ahead and tell Mash there will never be a Little Mermaid 3![wait tVoice]

？1：How does a Common get away with all this...?
？2：How does one little Common have such a big attitude...?

Hmph. Well, if I'm being honest, I don't have any good stories right now anyway. I've had some ideas, but none of them are all that appealing.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Andersen
[tVoice ValVoice_500500 0_V060]
I mean we just won a war for the fate of all humanity. No run-of-the-mill story is going to cut it after something like that.[wait tVoice]

...No, I shouldn't have said that. In this world, giving voice to ideas is what makes them possible.[wait tVoice]

＠Andersen
[tVoice ValVoice_500500 0_V090]
...Hmm. I can't believe I was tempted to see death and destruction on a massive scale just because I'm bored. I hope I'm not losing my mind.[wait tVoice]

So, what do you want? Just because I try to keep time on my hands doesn't mean I'm willing to waste it on nonsense.[wait tVoice]

？1：It's chocolate.
？2：A little token of my appreciation.

A-aha, I see. I've never written about this sort of thing before, but now it's all clear...[wait tVoice]

＠Andersen
[tVoice ValVoice_500500 0_V130]
So this is how it feels to be given a gift like this. Well, this should be a valuable experience for future stories.[wait tVoice]

？1：Are you blushing?

Hell no! I deserve this, dammit! It's a wonder I have any skin left with how many times I've worked myself to the bone for you![wait tVoice]

This contract is far more trouble than it's worth. A hunk of chocolate isn't going to begin to make up for that...[wait tVoice]

＠Andersen
[tVoice ValVoice_500500 0_V160]
...But, the idea of only taking without giving doesn't sit right with me, either. Here, take this.[wait tVoice]

I'm hardly the world's biggest Maeterlinck fan, but I can't deny his blue bird story's a good one.[wait tVoice]

I bought that mouse out of necessity during a trip, but it's so uncomfortable to use that I've barely touched it since.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_500500 0_V190]
I expect it'll still be good for something, though. Even if developers are the only people who use mice these days![wait tVoice]
