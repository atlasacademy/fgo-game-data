Indeed. Just an inconspicuous manual.[wait tVoice]

Perhaps you'll get dragged into a sinister plot. Perhaps you learn that a friend you thought trustworthy has been deceiving you.[wait tVoice]

I'll admit, that book does contain all manner of criminal ideas, both legal and otherwise...but it also contains countermeasures as well.[wait tVoice]

＠A：[servantName 202300:Archer of Shinjuku:Moriarty]
[tVoice ValVoice_202300 0_V190]
Yes, countermeasures! As I am familiar with this world's many evils, I have also devised ways to counteract them.[wait tVoice]
