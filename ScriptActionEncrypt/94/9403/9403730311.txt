[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Izo
Dojo fencing!
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Yes, that. Even in a dojo, fighters will duel with wooden swords. These swords may not cause injury, but it does hurt to be struck by one.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Izo
...What's your point?
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
I am told that in modern times, there is a form of dueling employing nonlethal blades where fighters do not strike their opponents.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
In other words, they merely make it seem as though they are striking their opponent, like so.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Izo
And? Is that supposed to be entertaining or something?
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
This form of showmanship designed to resemble a fight to the death to onlookers is called “fight choreography.”

Showmanship? Swordplay's not spectacle.

Roma Kureishi used to be my[line 2]Miguel's subordinate, though, judging from his background he also seems to be something of an unusual character.

Vargas and García are pretending[sr]to be hunters, but apparently...
