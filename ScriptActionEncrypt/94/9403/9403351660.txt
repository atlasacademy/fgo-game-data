？1：Is everything okay?

？！

This is ridiculous. I have been in dungeons that were more spacious than this. These ceilings should be at least twice as high.[wait tVoice]

You are the one who summoned and formed a contract with me, are you not? Then do something about this.[wait tVoice]

Hmph. Even a quick glance from my Mystic Eyes must be difficult for you to bear. Perhaps you will think twice before you speak to me from now on.[wait tVoice]

Just because you have summoned me does not give you license to run your mouth. The next time, I will skip paralysis and go straight to full petrification.[wait tVoice]

But, this works out nicely. Today, I have something I wish for you to keep for me.[wait tVoice]

A gift from me to my foolish, minuscule Master...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Gorgon
[tVoice ValVoice_1100400 0_V160]
...this is not. Do not misunderstand. This is a gift for my beautiful sisters, and no one else.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Gorgon
[tVoice ValVoice_1100400 0_V170]
However, well, you can see what I look like. I am far too deformed to show myself before them.[wait tVoice]

＠Gorgon
[tVoice ValVoice_1100400 0_V180]
I have no wish to frighten them, nor for them to relive painful memories of our final moments together.[wait tVoice]

Thus, I am leaving them in your care. You are to deliver them to my sisters, without fail.[wait tVoice]

＠Gorgon
[tVoice ValVoice_1100400 0_V200]
If possible, I would like you to bring one to a version of myself who has not materialized in this form as well...[wait tVoice]

＠Gorgon
[tVoice ValVoice_1100400 0_V210]
...Whether it is the big one or the small one makes no difference to me. Though, if you should happen to see both, I would have them each receive one.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Gorgon
[tVoice ValVoice_1100400 0_V220]
Now listen to me very carefully.[sr]Do NOT tell them who these gifts are from.[wait tVoice]

＠Gorgon
[tVoice ValVoice_1100400 0_V230]
If they ask, just tell them they are from you. Is that clear?[wait tVoice]
