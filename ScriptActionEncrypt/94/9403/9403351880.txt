Yup, yup, Hektor's here.[sr]Hey, what's that you've got there, Master?[wait tVoice]

Last I checked, these old Servant bones hadn't done anything worthy of receiving such a fancy reward.[wait tVoice]

I might be okay at defense, but offense has never really been my thing.[wait tVoice]

？1：Now, now, that's enough of that.
？2：Just shut up and take it.

But man, after getting chocolate this nice, I couldn't call myself a hero if I didn't return the favor.[wait tVoice]

Only trouble is, I don't got anything on me that you might be happy with...[wait tVoice]

？1：What is this...?

＠Hektor
[tVoice ValVoice_301600 0_V090]
C'mon, it's only Troy's most famous invention of all time. It's the Trojan Horse.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：The Trojan Horse?

You got it! Haha, guess my woodworking skills aren't too shabby after all.[wait tVoice]

Huh? Am I sure I don't want to keep it for myself?[sr]Sure I'm sure.[wait tVoice]

＠Hektor
[tVoice ValVoice_301600 0_V120]
For me, Troy only lasted until I died.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hektor
[tVoice ValVoice_301600 0_V130]
It's a shame that it fell once I was gone, but no country stays the same forever. Sooner or later, it either falls to ruin or becomes something else entirely.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hektor
[tVoice ValVoice_301600 0_V140]
I'll love it as best I can until it's gone, but I can't stick around forever to see how it ends up changing.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hektor
[tVoice ValVoice_301600 0_V150]
That's for people still living in that time to defend and fight for.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hektor
[tVoice ValVoice_301600 0_V160]
Sure, I miss it sometimes, but it'd be way worse being a guy who can't let go of the past.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hektor
[tVoice ValVoice_301600 0_V170]
Also, if I'm being totally honest...[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 5]

[tVoice ValVoice_301600 0_V180]
...I still can't believe they fell for such an obvious trap! Dammit, Paris, why didn't you try to stop them!?[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Hektor
[tVoice ValVoice_301600 0_V190]
...That's at least a third of how I feel about it. I mean, just look at this thing.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hektor
[tVoice ValVoice_301600 0_V200]
Why would those idiots ever think to just open the gates and bring it inside...?[wait tVoice]

But anyway, Master, I think I might've told you this before... Then again, maybe I didn't?[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Hektor
[tVoice ValVoice_301600 0_V220]
Right now, far as I'm concerned, you're my new Troy.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hektor
[tVoice ValVoice_301600 0_V230]
So if you go ahead and accept this from me, you won't even look twice at any other wooden horses, right?[wait tVoice]
