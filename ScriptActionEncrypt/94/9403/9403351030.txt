Good day, Master. I know you've been running around a lot, but do you have a little time to spare?[wait tVoice]

You always take part in Chaldea's various events, so I'm sure this goes without saying by now, but...[wait tVoice]

Happy Valentine's Day. This isn't much, but I tried mixing in chocolate...[wait tVoice]

＠Martha
[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V040]
...to bake these bis coctus panis. I, um, think they're called “biscuits” nowadays?[wait tVoice]

Do you know how Valentine's Day originally began? It all got started when Valentinius was martyred...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Martha
[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V060]
He displayed great courage in the face of his hardships, so...I think he would be very happy that the day of his...ahem, valiant martyrdom has brought people together with love.[wait tVoice]

I should probably say that, strictly speaking, its true origins lie in ancient Roman mythology, but still.[wait tVoice]

＠Martha
[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V080]
I think that Valentinius deserves to be praised for his sacrifice. Or perhaps, that his martyrdom led to faith...[wait tVoice]

＠Martha
[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V090]
...for an ancient goddess of love and marriage. Regardless, the fact that he brought smiles to many people can only be a good thing.[wait tVoice]

...Yes? What is it? Is there something wrong with my chocolate cookies?[wait tVoice]

＠Martha
[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V110]
A dumbbell? Huh? There's a dumbbell mixed in among my pile of cookies.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Martha
[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V120]
Wha[line 2]How could a dumbbell be mixed in with cookies? Only the devil could come up with such a foul idea![wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Martha
[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V130]
I mean, I did think that my plain old cookies might have less impact compared to other people's gifts...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Martha
[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V140]
...so I ended up making a super high-density one-ton chocolate dumbbell before I knew what I was doing...but there's no way it would end up mixed in with...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Martha
[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V150]
...It is definitely mixed in there, isn't it.[wait tVoice]

Ugh, this is exactly the problem! I always, always end up doing a careless, slipshod job![wait tVoice]

＠Martha
[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V170]
For that matter, making food for only one person is just too damn tedious![wait tVoice]

＠Martha
[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V180]
I'm used to cooking for an entire household! Making tiny little things like this just isn't in my wheelhouse![wait tVoice]

No matter how hard it may be, chocolate is still chocolate. Don't worry, [%1], it will still taste just as good.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V220]
As long as you have courage, spirit, faith, and effort, you can find anything tasty if you put your mind to it♡[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_401900 0_V230]
So please, make sure you eat it all up, okay? It would mean a lot to me if you did♡[wait tVoice]
