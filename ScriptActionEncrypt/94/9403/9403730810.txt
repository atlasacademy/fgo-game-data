This place seems much bigger than it needs to be.

＠Salazar
That's partly because there is also an emergency shelter here. One never knows when one might need it.

＠Salazar
We're prepared for anything here.[sr]We have food and medicine alike in ample supply.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
I see. So where is this medicine we need?
[k]

＠Salazar
I think it was on this shelf...[wt 1.0][charaFace C 2][sr]Oops!

A truly riveting performance, but I do think he's taking it a bit too far. It's as though he truly has lost his mind. Ugh, method actors.
