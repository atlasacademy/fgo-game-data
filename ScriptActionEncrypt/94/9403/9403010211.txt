Shirou's actually supposed to be a dog, but then Louhi said something that turned him into a kind of bear.

While we're on the subject...his name isn't really Shirou, either.

Anyway, I can see you're all real strong. Strong enough to collect all the fragments of the Kamuy's Gold.

I haven't had my fill of fighting yet.[sr]If anything, I'm really only getting warmed up.

If we'd kept at this a little longer, my spear would've torn through your Spirit Origin like so much confetti.

＠Ibaraki-Douji
But, all right. I'm back in the zone for fighting in this Spirit Origin now. Oniland can throw all the fake oni it wants at me, and it won't make any difference!

After all the trouble I took to hijack an Oniland bus and set up an ambush for those annoying guests...

I don't think they're even coming![sr]Curse you, you cowards!

They don't seem to be hiding out in the city, either! Gehehehehe, very well then!

My attraction managers will be sure to show[sr]them a good time! Gehehehe! Gahahahahaha!
