Hehehe... It would be sooo easy to just[sr]kill you both now, but you're in luck.
[k]

＠Black Quetzal Mask
I thought you might show up, so I kept a special seed slot open for you, so you could skip the prelims.
[k]

＠Black Quetzal Mask
You can take it, and try to make your way through the tournament. I will fight for Mexico. Claro?
[k]

＠Black Quetzal Mask
If you're lucky, we can settle this in the finals.

...Rituals often have the effect of bringing two vastly different forces together, like humans and nature.[sr]Or gods and humans, in this case.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Fighting while bound by the same rules should help get around the difference in strength, but...

Heh. I may be a ruda, but I am not a cheater, no.[sr]The ring is holy, and its rules absolute.

＠Black Quetzal Mask
Perhaps my respect for such things is even why[sr]this Spirit Origin was designated a Ruler.

[charaFace C 6]

＠Black Quetzal Mask
Furthermore...this battle is[sr]meant to celebrate Christmas.

At this point, I think making a strategic retreat, entering this tournament, climbing the rankings...
[k]

...and eventually facing off against Dark Quetzal Mask in the ring might be our only realistic option.

Why thank you. But you'll have to forgive me if I'm not entirely buying what you're selling here.

It's a bit hard to believe you're using the Holy Grail's power out of the goodness of your heart.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And since we can't let you get away with whatever you're planning, entering the tournament is just the most expedient way to stop you.

＠Black Quetzal Mask
This battle will decide Santa's rightful successor.[sr]The winner WILL become Santa.
[k]

＠Black Quetzal Mask
A Santa so powerful they'll be able to make every day Christmas, whether it's December 25th or not....
[k]

＠Black Quetzal Mask
...and leave every other Santa as[sr]nothing more than a distant memory.
[k]

？1：...(Gulp)
？2：(I don't know what that means, but it sounds...big.)
？！

＠Black Quetzal Mask
As a Santa aspirant, I'm sure you[sr]want this power for yourself.

[charaFace C 6]
＠Black Quetzal Mask
Now go on. The tournament begins tomorrow.
[k]

＠Black Quetzal Mask
Show me you meet the minimum qualifications to enter and I'll permit you to do so as Chaldea's team.
[k]

＠Black Quetzal Mask
Go ahead and do your worst.[sr]Hahahaha!

This is a very unexpected twist, yes! But getting to fight by the rules of lucha is the best news I've had all day!

As long as I'm in my precious lucha ring, I can piledrive that masked goddess into the mat any day of the week, yes!

＠Quetzalcoatl
Pero I still have no idea what she was talking about. She's very bad at explaining things.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
She said something about qualifications, yes?
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Why would she tell us to qualify after she personally invited us to enter the tournament? It makes no sense...
[k]

？1：Now that you mention it, that does seem strange...
