Could this be the diabolical book that brainwashed Elisabeth?

D-Da Vinci? Isn't that dangerous?

＠Da Vinci
I'll be fine. Prominent artists are also prominent critics, and I am possessed of an imperturbable, discerning eye.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So I won't get brainwashed that easily.[sr]Okay, what happens next? (Flip, flip) [se ade96][seVolume ade96 0 0.5]

The contents really are something else. These superhuman feats wouldn't be possible unless the characters were Servants.

Hahaha, [%1] is depicted as[sr]going completely off the deep end.

＠Da Vinci
Their arms flail like tentacles and they don't even look human. They're constantly rubbing against and groping Mash.

[charaFace B 3]
＠Mash
I-is that what's in that book...?
[k]

？1：Libel! That's libel!

[charaFace B 7]
＠Mash
Right!
[k]

＠Mash
Senpai has never done such a thing!
[k]

＠Mash
I can say that with pride!

＠Da Vinci
Exactly.
[k]

？！

＠Da Vinci
And even Mash, who's practically[sr]abused by [%1]...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...doesn't seem to mind it that much![sr]At least in this book!

...!

＠Da Vinci
Oh sorry, sorry.[sr]I didn't mean to upset you.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Mash
N-no. I've read in the manuals that as long as it's between two people sharing mutual affection, such behavior is quite natural...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
(Hmmm, I guess Romani didn't do a great job with the birds and the bees talk.) Right, right.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Hold on a minute. Calm down, Mash! We're not talking about the real [%1] here.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The character in this book is completely different from[sr][%1].
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I mean, they're not even human!
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Mash
Ah!
[k]

＠Mash
Th-that's right! This is terrible![sr]This could affect Senpai's reputation!

Senpai, um...I hope you aren't upset by this?
