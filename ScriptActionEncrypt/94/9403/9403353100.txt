Oh, there you are.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V270]
We are told today is a day to bestow gifts that symbolize our appreciation for those we care about.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V280]
And we cannot help but notice that you seem insistent on remaining unaware of your own worth.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V290]
As such, we see this as an excellent opportunity to fully and finally demonstrate that worth to you.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：You're kind of scaring me here!
？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V300]
So, you are afraid? Good, good. We are glad to see you understand what a humbling honor this is for you.[wait tVoice]

Hahaha, then let us get right to it then.[sr]Take this![wait tVoice]

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V320]
An elixir made with Chinese alchemy. We are certain the stories surrounding our history with it are the same in Proper Human History as they were in our empire. Surely you know of them?[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V330]
Worry not. These are nothing like the failures we ordered made with mercury. No, these are the genuine article, made with our own eternal empire's Fusang Tree Mystics.[wait tVoice]

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V340]
Of course, we no longer have any reason to take them ourselves, now that we have left the confines of Epang Palace and attained this Zhenren body.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V350]
So why not give it to someone with a finite life span, rather than let it go to waste?[wait tVoice]
[k]


？1：So, if I take these...I'll be immortal?
？！

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V360]
That is hard to say. It remains untested, as we could not go around imparting immortality to just anyone.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V370]
Ordinarily, we would burn that elixir to ashes so that it could never be used.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V380]
But now that we have found someone worthy of standing on equal footing with ourself, we are willing to entrust it to you.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V390]
Of course, it may still be harmful even without mercury, but no matter.[wait tVoice]
[k]


＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V400]
We are told you are invulnerable to poison,[sr]thanks to the protection of that shield girl.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V410]
So we would be less concerned about that and more concerned with what happens if they work as intended.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V420]
Partake, and you will live forever with us. We promise you that doing so will yield no end of ecstasy and glory.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V430]
But in doing so, you will also forever lose your chance at the solace that comes with death.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V440]
The question is, can your mind endure such pressure?[sr]Worry not, you need not decide now. Feel free to confer with the fairy woman before making your choice.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：I'll, uh, be sure to think about it...
？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V450]
Choose carefully, human of the people. For it is in choice that the true essence of humanity lies.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Qin Shi Huang
[tVoice ValVoice_900600 0_V460]
Imagine, a world where we are not the only one familiar with such a burden... Haha, [tdelay 1 4.0 1][charaFace A 2][delay -]what a fascinating thought![wait tVoice]
