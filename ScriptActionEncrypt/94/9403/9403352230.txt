Oh, forgive me. I was so moved I couldn't speak...[sr]You have shown me a great kindness, my Master.[wait tVoice]

However, I am well aware that you command a great many other Servants as well.[wait tVoice]

Thus, I feel somewhat ill-at-ease in being the only one to receive such an illustrious honor...[wait tVoice]

It is just that, my personal feelings aside, I am not sure how, um, certain other Heroic Spirits might respond...[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_300200 0_V100]
For example, speaking, um, purely hypothetically...if my king were ever to learn of this, well...[wait tVoice]

？1：It's okay. Don't overthink it.

For that reason alone, I am more grateful to you for summoning me as your Servant than I can say.[wait tVoice]

On that note, I would like to give something as well, as an expression of that gratitude.[wait tVoice]
