Well, we've been through most of the castle by now,[sr]and still no sign of anything that looks like a backup system...

Did it just open up?[bgm BGM_EVENT_81 0.3]

It must have had a secret door that was[sr]designed to react to the paper we have.

All right, let's go see what's lying[sr]in wait on the other side, shall we?

＠Reines
Gears and cranks everywhere you look, gauges and meters measuring who knows what, metal pipes and handles galore... Yup, steampunk through and through.
[k]

＠Reines
There's no telling when or from where a monster might try to attack us, but we should be able to handle anything that tries now that we have Gray here.

Oh yes, I'm counting on you too, of course.[sr]Well, on the Servants you command, anyway.

Hehehe, you're cute when you're upset. I assume you know this, but I was just messing with you again.

＠Reines
I guess that side of me just doesn't go away,[sr]even as a Pseudo-Servant.
[k]

？1：Lucky me...
？2：So you've always been like that?

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Reines
Oh yes. It's not as bad as you might think, either. It sure made the power struggles in the Clock Tower a lot easier, I can tell you that.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Reines
Honestly, these catacombs remind me[sr]a lot of all the time I spent there.
[k]

＠Reines
There's literally no end to the schemes and subterfuge that play out every single day there, so you kind of have to be into it just to get by, really.
[k]

？1：The Clock Tower's basically mage headquarters, right?
？2：Do all mages love to conspire or something?

？！

＠Reines
Given that Chaldea's involved with the Astromancy Department, I'd say it's a sure bet that the Clock Tower's been interfering there somehow.
[k]

＠Reines
I doubt you've ever given it much thought, since you don't seem especially...attuned to those sorts of things, but maybe you've heard someone from the administrative side of things mention it?
[k]

？1：Now that you mention it...
？2：Oh yeah, I heard them talking about it after we restored humanity.

？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠Reines
There you go. Even if you're a mage just looking for the Root[line 2]well, actually, even more so in that case[line 2]you're going to need a lot of authority to get anywhere.
[k]


＠Reines
We mages have an incredibly long and difficult road between us and our goals. Money and power are just two of the things we need to make any headway.
[k]

＠Reines
Though of course, even in the Clock Tower, a lot of mages become obsessed with power for its own sake.
