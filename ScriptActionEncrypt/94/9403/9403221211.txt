Good job! If you can put up that much fight,[sr]I doubt you'll be crushed by taking the bowl!

[charaFace A 1]

＠Sanzang
Okay then, here you go.[sr]One stone begging bowl used by the Buddha himself.

Don't worry about the money. You obviously need it for a reason, so I'm happy to let you have it.

Th-thank you, Sanzang.[sr]But...are you sure it's okay to just give it to us like this?

＠Sanzang
Oh yeah, it's no problem! I'm sure the Buddha would be happy that it's being put to good use. Besides, you'd literally be taking a huge weight off my shoulders!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Sanzang
In fact, that's exactly why I was[sr]hesitant to give it to you.
[k]

＠Sanzang
That's the Buddha's bowl, so it's a lot heavier than it looks, and it was originally a lot bigger, too.
[k]

＠Sanzang
So big that the entire Enma-tei could[sr]fit inside it with room to spare.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Sanzang
So I was afraid that it might end up squishing[sr]you if I gave it to you, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Sanzang
But you all handled my Buddha Palm without a problem, right? So I'm sure you'll be fine!
[k]

＠Sanzang
It's all yours! Oh, but make sure you only use it outside, in case it expands to its original size!
[k]

？1：Thanks, Sanzang!
？2：The Buddha sure is huge, isn't he!

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sanzang
Yes! The Buddha knows and sees all!
