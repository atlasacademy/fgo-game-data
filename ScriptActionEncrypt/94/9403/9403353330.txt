I first learned of this peculiar custom about a week ago. They said it originated in Rome, and is now celebrated worldwide.[wait tVoice]

I see. Chocolat, huh![wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Bradamante
[tVoice ValVoice_303600 0_V080]
...But I also heard that, for example in your birthplace, it's primarily used to convey one's secret feelings for another.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Bradamante
[tVoice ValVoice_303600 0_V090]
And I thought that meant I couldn't take part in it,[sr]since Ruggiero might be out there somewhere...[wait tVoice]

＠Bradamante
[tVoice ValVoice_303600 0_V150]
And while he may not exactly be...helpful very often,[tdelay 1 3.5 1][charaFace A 0][delay -][sr]there's also Stolfo...not to mention everyone else who I'll be fighting alongside![wait tVoice]

How could I tell you, and all of them, that I wouldn't be taking part in this custom? This is a crucial test. There are so many people I want to show my appreciation to![wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 2]
