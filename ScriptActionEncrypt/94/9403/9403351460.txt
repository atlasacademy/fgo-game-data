Hahaha. And you have my gratitude in turn, Master. [&It's refreshing to get a gift from a fellow man now and then.:It's always a thrill to receive a gift from a lady!][wait tVoice]

So, now what? Did you think I was just going to say a cool goodbye and be gone like the wind?[wait tVoice]

No, I have already bitten my thumb enough to know just what sort of day today truly is![wait tVoice]

And given my handsome face and elegant body, I cannot possibly let this day end without making a suitable gesture.[wait tVoice]

Valentine's Day. Certainly one can give gifts without reciprocation on this day, but for those who are truly close, gifts can also be exchanged mutually.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_301100 0_V090]
Accounts seem to differ on its exact origins, but regardless of how it began, it is now a most tasteful event.[wait tVoice]

＠Fionn
[tVoice ValVoice_301100 0_V100]
I think it's wonderful! Thus, I have taken the liberty of readying a gift of my own![wait tVoice]

＠Fionn
[tVoice ValVoice_301100 0_V110]
I give you...[wait tVoice]

Indeed, that is exactly what it is! A salmon![sr]One that won't give you...salmonella![wait tVoice]

Good, nobody's here to stop me from punning again...[sr]Now, behold how it splashes! How it kicks! [wait tVoice]

Hm? You can let down your guard, Master. It's just a salmon.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Fionn
[tVoice ValVoice_301100 0_V160]
Just your everyday, ordinary salmon.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Huh? It is?
？2：So I won't get infinite wisdom from it, huh...

？！

＠Fionn
[tVoice ValVoice_301100 0_V170]
Yes, nothing to worry about there. You can lick its fat all you want and nothing will happen to you. Well, except for a small intelligence boost, perhaps.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：You mean, from the DHA...?

？！

＠Fionn
[tVoice ValVoice_301100 0_V180]
Why yes. DHA: Docosahexaenoic acid. A fatty acid rich in vital polyunsaturated omega-3 oils.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Fionn
[tVoice ValVoice_301100 0_V190]
Consuming such acid can keep your brain and eyes in good working order, and even improve them. Now do you understand?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Fionn
[tVoice ValVoice_301100 0_V200]
Now then, I bid you farewell, Master. I have other salmon to deliver.[wait tVoice]

I can't keep Chaldea's female staff hanging after they took one look at me and fell deeply in love, after all...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Fionn
[tVoice ValVoice_301100 0_V220]
So at the very least, I must bring them each a fish so as not to utterly break their hearts. Truly, it's not easy being such a capable, beautiful king![wait tVoice]
