Oh, though of course, that's not to say I would do that for anyone and everyone.

＠Pārvatī
I'm sure you've realized as much from our battles so far, but I don't feel the need to pray for them every time.

I understand that the enemy would see that as naivete and weakness.

But still, when I do happen to feel a desire to be kind to them...I don't want to ignore it.

I think they also said that your Spirit Origins may be different, but you all share the same Divine Core.

As you know, I'm manifesting right now via the innate goodness in this girl I'm using as my avatar.

＠Pārvatī
That goodness also repels any disposition that can't acclimate to it...

Either way, there might still[sr]be a tiny drop of that in me...

＠Pārvatī
...but it's so small that I couldn't[sr]worry about it even if I wanted to.

[charaFace B 4]

...That's true. Or at least, it usually would.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Pārvatī
But I think the important thing is that I'm still here despite that.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
And I think the fact I'm here even though I'm not well suited for fighting[line 2]that I'm here even though I had to borrow part of my husband's power to manifest...
[k]

[charaFace B 7]
＠Pārvatī
...I can't help but feel like that means something.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
There's some sort of reason why I need to be here, rather than Durgā or Kālī.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
It's significant, somehow.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Pārvatī
Or at least, that's how it feels to me. I'm afraid there isn't much else I can say beyond that at this point.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Pārvatī
Of course, I'm sure you would have all preferred I manifested with a side that was a little better at fighting...

I know it would make things at least a little easier for all of you if I had, so I am sorry about that...
[k]

？1：No problems here!

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Pārvatī
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

No, I have to think more positively than that.[sr]I'll do my best to be as helpful as I can!
