[%1]. What in the world are you doing here?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V020]
You weren't in the Command Room, or your own room, or the cafeteria, or Da Vinci's workshop...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V030]
If you just wanted to go for a walk, you could've gone to the training room.[wait tVoice]
[k]


？1：No, I'm not out on a walk.

？！

[charaFace A 10]
＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V040]
Then what ARE you up to, going around and around the hallway like you're waiting for something? It's super shady.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 9]
＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V050]
Huh? I'm the shady one here? I'm not the type to just strike up a conversation for no reason?[wait tVoice]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V060]
I probably just broke some of Chaldea's equipment again and need you to fix it?[wait tVoice]

W-well, I know I've had you help me out with things like that a lot[line 2]uh, a few times before...but that's not what this is about today...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V080]
I was just saying hi to you like I would any other morning... Although, that's not really what this is about, either...[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Aha! Okay, hand over the chocolate!
？2：No way. Are you here to give me a gift, goddess?

？！

[charaFace A 16]
＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V090]
[fontSize large]Just like that!?[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V100]
W-well that was pretty direct of you. Then again, I guess that's always been your deal, hasn't it.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V110]
But, you're not wrong. I know about Valentine's Day just as much as the next Divine Spirit.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V120]
Besides, I'd probably feel bad if I didn't do anything for it, and it's not like I'm completely ungrateful for all the help you've given me...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V130]
...(Sigh) Guess there's no point holding anything back anymore, now that I've already shown my hand.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V140]
I've been really off my game in this Spirit Origin. It's like...I've grown soft? Or maybe, that I'm happy when someone else lays into me...?[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V150]
Well, whatever. Here you go, [%1].[wait tVoice]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V160]
I made sure to touch them up so they'd fit your modern tastes. They should taste as spectacular as they look.[wait tVoice]

You know the saying “Happiness gathers at merry houses”? I prefer “Bonuses gather around pretty objects.”[wait tVoice]

I put a lot of hard work into making sure they'd bring you fortune and more fortune♡ Whatever you choose to spend them on, you can never have too much money, right?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V200]
What's good for you is good for me. Plus, the richer you are, the more money you can spend on raising me![wait tVoice]

？1：Thanks, Ishtar. I love it.
？2：This is really nice of you, but I'm not sure how I feel about it.

[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V230]
Surely you're not just going to leave it at “Thanks” after getting Valentine's chocolate as lovely as this, are you?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Ishtar
[tVoice ValVoice_202000 0_V240]
That's why I'm counting on you to be my special, gorgeous escort! Something befitting a first-rate Master like you![wait tVoice]
