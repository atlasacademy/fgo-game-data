Well, well. I certainly wasn't expecting to run into Nagao Kagetora of Echigo here.

Yes! Uesugi Kenshin was known as Echigo's god of war, the strongest general of the Warring States period!

＠Mash
Uesugi Kenshin was the daimyo of Echigo, and known far and wide as the strongest general in the Warring States period! So much so that she eventually came to be known as Echigo's god of war!
[k]

？！


＠Mash
And if I'm not mistaken,[sr]her birth name was Nagao Kagetora!
[k]

＠Mash
Though I didn't know she was a woman up until now!

I'm sorry for hiding my identity from you.

＠Nagao Kagetora
I knew of my fame and didn't want to frighten you off...
[k]

[charaFace C 8]

＠Nagao Kagetora
Although... Did you say “the strongest general of the Warring States period”?
[k]

＠Nagao Kagetora
I-I mean, that's not wrong, but still...
[k]

＠Nagao Kagetora
And wait: “Echigo's god of war”?[sr]Is that really what they call me in your time?
[k]

[charaFace C 14]

＠Nagao Kagetora
Ahahahaha! Echigo's god of war! I like that![sr]I think I'll start going by it right now, in fact!
[k]

[charaFace C 13]

＠Nagao Kagetora
So there you have it, you villainous scum-of-the-earth, Oda Nobunaga! Nagao Kagetora, Echigo's god of war, is here to bring you to justice!

Wait, hang on. [%1]? Mash?[sr]I thought that was you!

[charaFace A 12]

＠Nobbu
It sure does!
[k]

＠Nobbu
I'm touched you came all this way to help me out!
[k]

？2：Nobbu from Chaldea? You look...different.

[charaFace A 11]

＠Nobbu
Yeah, my Spirit Origin started acting up when I first materialized here. Got a new class and everything, too.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]

＠Nobbu
Is that okay? Should I do an Ascension?

Where's the boss of this place already!?

？1：That guy seems like bad news...if it even is a guy.
