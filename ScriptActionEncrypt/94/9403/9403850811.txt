Huh, so this is kykeon? [bgm BGM_EVENT_2 0.1]It's really good.

[charaFace D 1]

＠Nagao Kagetora
Maybe we really could use this to feed the Chaldea[sr]clan's army, [%1]. It's definitely tasty,[sr]and it seems to be rich in nutrients too.

Um... Who are you again? Eh, doesn't matter.[sr]What matters is that you are a man of taste.

＠Restaurant Owner Medea
It's true. Kykeon can even be taken as medicine! It's that good for you! And I'm sure you could all use a steady source of nutritious meals, since you're fighting a nearly endless war.

？1：If you like it that much, Kagetora, then it's fine with me.

？2：All right Medea, you've got yourself a deal.
