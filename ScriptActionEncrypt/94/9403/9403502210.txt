But, this is also an excellent opportunity![sr]Now I can continue on ahead alone.

After all...

＠Goredolf
...there's a paradise waiting for me!

＠Goredolf
That is the Ooku! A place where every pleasure in the world can be found under one roof!
[k]

＠Goredolf
I don't have to do any obligations here, and I can do whatever I please! It's all just for me!

But, clever as I am, I've already figured out the pattern. No doubt she has the key.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Goredolf
Unfortunately, I'm almost out[sr]of combat Craft Essences now.
[k]

＠Goredolf
The smart thing to do would be to get ahold of that key without fighting her...
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Goredolf
And of course, I am nothing if not smart. I may not be great at stealth spells, but let's see what happens...

I daresay Robin Hood himself couldn't have done it better. Perhaps I maxed out my DEX stat without realizing it.

Ah, this feels good. What a wonderful place.[sr]I knew there was nowhere better than the Ooku.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]

＠Goredolf
...But then, I suppose that's only to be expected. Only the shogun is welcome in the Ooku, and all of its pleasures are reserved solely for him.

And since I'm here, I must be the shogun, so of course I would feel good while I'm here...
