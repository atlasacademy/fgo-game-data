You've got guts, making me go to all this hassle. If we were in Connacht, you'd be in biiig trouble, you know that?[wait tVoice]

？1：Is this about what I think it's about?
？2：You're giving me Valentine's chocolate?

I sure am. This is an event for lovers, right? Though I could've sworn it was also about bird couples...[wait tVoice]

That's right. You SHOULD be grateful. Any brave would be overjoyed to get a present from me.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 14]

＠Medb
[tVoice ValVoice_401300 0_V080]
In fact, getting a present from me without giving me one first?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medb
[tVoice ValVoice_401300 0_V090]
That's so rare it's practically unheard of. So make sure you remember this day for the rest of your life.[wait tVoice]

That's right! It's true love chocolate, the kind I only give to those I actually care about![wait tVoice]

＠Medb
[tVoice ValVoice_401300 0_V120]
I made sure it would be ready in time for this day. I've got true love chocolate, genuine true love chocolate, destined true love chocolate...[wait tVoice]

＠Medb
[tVoice ValVoice_401300 0_V130]
I'm only giving you the lowest-grade true love chocolate, but I'm sure you won't have a problem with that...will you?[wait tVoice]

＠Medb
[tVoice ValVoice_401300 0_V150]
Well, that takes care of the first one. I was a liiittle unsure how this would go since it was my first time, but of course it turned out to be easy.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medb
[tVoice ValVoice_401300 0_V160]
This proves beyond a doubt that I can handle modern-day events just as easily as those from my time.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medb
[tVoice ValVoice_401300 0_V170]
Oh, right. Say, Master, you wouldn't happen to know where Cú is, would you?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medb
[tVoice ValVoice_401300 0_V180]
Any one of them will do. No, on second thought, since it is a special occasion and all, I want you to tell me where I can find all of them.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medb
[tVoice ValVoice_401300 0_V190]
Where's my Cú in blue with his red spear?[sr]Where's the slightly younger Cú with armor?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Medb
[tVoice ValVoice_401300 0_V200]
Where's the Cú dressed like a druid?[sr]And of course...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Medb
[tVoice ValVoice_401300 0_V210]
Where's the really cute and valiant-looking one with the sharp teeth? Where's MY Cú?[wait tVoice]

＠Medb
[tVoice ValVoice_401300 0_V220]
Oh, I almost forgot about Fergus.[sr]Do you happen to know where he is, too?[wait tVoice]

We queens can't go around only bestowing gifts upon a single Master, after all.[wait tVoice]

As for the chocolate, make sure you savor eeeach and every bite, as if it were the tastiest thing you'll ever have in your life. Is that clear?[wait tVoice]
