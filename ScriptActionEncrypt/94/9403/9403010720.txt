＠Sitonai
...What a strange feeling.
[k]

＠Sitonai
I never expected to materialize like this.
[k]

[charaFace C 14]

＠Sitonai
Especially not as a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Sitonai
I suppose I do technically have a connection[sr]to the Holy Grail, since this body was one...
[k]

[charaFace C 14]

＠Sitonai
Have you ever heard of a Lesser Grail?

＠Sitonai
Oh, right, Chaldea doesn't have much experience with actual Holy Grail Wars, do you? You still have some data about them though, right?
[k]

＠Sitonai
Well, this body of mine[line 2]the one serving[sr]as a vessel for three Divine Spirits...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Sitonai
...is taken from several years ago.
[k]

＠Sitonai
Under normal circumstances...it shouldn't even be alive anymore.
[k]

[charaFace C 13]

＠Sitonai
Well, things might be different in this world...but I'm guessing it probably died here too.
[k]

[charaFace C 15]

＠Sitonai
This body was never meant[sr]to live very long, after all.

＠Ibaraki-Douji
So? Is that any different from being a Heroic Spirit?[sr]I died a long time ago too, and so did Shuten.
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Kintoki and Raikou did, too.[sr]That always cheers me up!
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
So even after all that “High Servant” stuff, you're basically just like the rest of us[line 2]like a phantom, pretty much.

＠Sitonai
I don't think I'm quite the same thing as a Heroic Spirit, since I'm not engraved in the Throne...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Sitonai
...But, yeah, I guess you're right.
[k]

＠Sitonai
I'm just a phantom of someone who died[sr]and doesn't even exist any longer...
[k]

[charaFace C 14]

＠Sitonai
In that sense...I guess there isn't much difference between me and the Gold Servants.
[k]

＠Sitonai
Well, aside from the fact that their[sr]cores are made of the Kamuy's Gold.

...[sr]...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
...Oh, right. I just remembered.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
You're not a Heroic Spirit who has a contract with Chaldea, are you, Sitonai?

＠Sitonai
No, I'm not.
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Then, once this Oniland ordeal is over,[sr]I'll never get to see you again. Hmm.
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
That means the version of you I'm talking to now really only exists in the moment, doesn't it?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Sitonai
Well, now that I've formed a bond with Master,[sr]I suppose I could return if [&he:she] summons me...

But that wouldn't be you, right?
[k]

[charaFace C 15]

＠Sitonai
...No. Once this is over,[sr]this version of me will be gone forever.
[k]

＠Sitonai
But that's just how it is with Servants.[sr]...No, not just Servants.
[k]

[charaFace C 18]

＠Sitonai
I think that's just how it is for all living things.
[k]

＠Sitonai
There's a saying that goes, “Treasure every encounter, for each is unique and will never happen again.”
[k]

Hmm.

Isn't there anything you want[sr]to do before you disappear?

[charaFace A 5]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
I know I'd be pissed off if I had to spend all my time working only to disappear for good when it was over.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
I mean, that's just...boring.
[k]

[charaFace C 13]

＠Sitonai
Hmm.[sr]Something I'd want to do...

[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Sitonai
Huh?
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Well, my Spirit Origin is a Lancer right now. I didn't know you'd have preferred I stay a Berserker.
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
I'm afraid you're just going to have to accept that you'll never get to see me as a Berserker.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
But...why do you prefer Berserkers? Were you going to use my fangs and claws to set off fireworks?
