Hehe, this Valentine's stuff is great! When else can I give you a present without a hint of shame![wait tVoice]

That's a custom-made gift I ordered months ago.[sr]The only thing I know about cooking is boiling water for my Cosmic Noodles...[wait tVoice]

＠B：Heroine XX
[tVoice ValVoice_2500300 0_V100]

Money's the one thing I've got going for me, after all! I'm a much harder worker than you might think![wait tVoice]

Don't be silly, Master. Your job is just as real as mine. Not everyone could handle what you do at Chaldea, you know.[wait tVoice]

Earth may not have any space criminals, but did you know it's under all sorts of other threats?[wait tVoice]

＠B：Heroine XX
[tVoice ValVoice_2500300 0_V150]
A sea connected to a whole other world. A mineshaft that still leads to the planet's reverse sea. An altar that induces visions of the sun expanding.[wait tVoice]

＠B：Heroine XX
[tVoice ValVoice_2500300 0_V151]
The special-class Great Three of the moon,[sr]mists, and bridge... And so on...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠B：Heroine XX
[tVoice ValVoice_2500300 0_V160]
Any one of these has the power alien to the current world, capable of destroying everything we know.[wait tVoice]

After a long and arduous investigation, I managed to identify one of them...but there's no way I can solve this case on my own.[wait tVoice]

＠B：Heroine XX

But I can't just ignore a threat assessment that enormous, either... Especially not when there's a huge bonus for taking it down...[wait tVoice]
