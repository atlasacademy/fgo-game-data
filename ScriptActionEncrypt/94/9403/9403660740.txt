That's ridiculous! It's not even a steam engine at this point! Sir Babbage was right. This sort of thing shouldn't exist in the first place!

Someone took it!? Then...does that mean this engine used to run on the magical energy in that paper, and it's now sucking up the energy from ghosts to compensate for its loss...?

So these ghosts are being made to incorporate that steam to make up for the magical energy that's taken from them!?

Dammit! It looks like we need to deal with these steam ghosts before we can do anything else!
