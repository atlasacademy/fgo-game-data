？1：By the way, what cut of meat was it?
？！


＠Beowulf
[tVoice ValVoice_700800 0_V220]
That'd be the throat. It's the tastiest, most muscular part, thanks to their breath attacks.[wait tVoice]

？1：...Wait. Breath attacks?

？2：Uhh... What animal was this from again?

Dragons breathe fire and stuff, right? That's why their throats are the most muscular and best tasting.[wait tVoice]
