How polite of you.[sr]I award you three points.[wait tVoice]

But I also get the sense you're making fun of me,[sr]so I'm also deducting three points.[wait tVoice]

I'm told that my country only began celebrating Valentine's fairly recently...[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V060]
...but any excuse to get presents is a good one in my book. Don't you think?[wait tVoice]

＠Anastasia
[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V070]
So, on that note...I would like some chocolate please, Master.[wait tVoice]

Wh-what's the meaning of this?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Anastasia
[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V090]
I specifically asked the other Servants about this.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Anastasia
[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V100]
They said that, for example in Japan, Valentine's is primarily considered a day where women give gifts to those they care for deeply.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Anastasia
[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V110]
And that they then receive return gifts on White Day.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Anastasia
[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V120]
So as a Servant, I thought I was supposed to give you chocolate first.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：There's nothing in the rules about that.

＠Anastasia
[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V130]
I see...[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：I wanted to give some to everyone, anyway.

＠Anastasia
[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V140]
Khh... You really put one over on me. I never expected you would already have a gift ready to go.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Anastasia
[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V150]
...Very well then, I would be honored to accept this present.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Anastasia
[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V160]
Now, prepare to sing my praises in amazement,[sr]for I have a present for you, too.[wait tVoice]

Just who do you think I am? Of course I had one ready.[sr]Any grand duchess worth her jewels would have done the same.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Anastasia
[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V230]
So I decided to give you a Viy plushie instead.[sr]Hehe, isn't he adorable?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Anastasia
[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V240]
I infused him with magical energy, so he might cause the occasional supernatural phenomenon or two...[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 6]

[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V250]
...but that's no big deal![wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_503500 0_V260]
Now, now, I'm sure it won't be any problem whatsoever...probably.[wait tVoice]

＠Anastasia

Anyway, Master, I think I'm going to have some chocolate right now.[wait tVoice]

Since we're already both here,[sr]why don't you join me?[wait tVoice]
