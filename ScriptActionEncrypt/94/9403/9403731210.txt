It said that people only get jealous[sr]of others who have something they want.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I don't really know anything about that kinda whiny crap, but it sounds right to me.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
So if Elise was jealous of Gabriela, you might think it's because of her money. But it couldn't be that, because Elise was already comfortable in her singing career and on her way to being truly rich.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
No, I think that if Elise was actually jealous of her, it would only be because Gabriela was a better singer.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
So I don't think she was jealous.[sr]I think it goes deeper than that.

A reason that motivated her to pull every string she could to get in, just like Antonio did for his sheet music.

[charaFace A 7]

She wanted to see her beloved childhood friend again!

＠Jeanne Alter
Back when this country was still the Kingdom of Nadai Nadha, Elise was a child living in poverty.

There's no way she would've had a good life in the final months leading up to the coup. Luckily, Elise had a close friend she could always lean on for support...

And since Elise was still a commoner, there was no way she'd be able to see her friend again now that she's basically royalty.

＠Jeanne Alter
But Elise didn't give up. She vowed to see her friend again, and used what few familial bonds she had to find Antonio...

...and worked hard to become a singer famous[sr]enough to rub shoulders with royalty.

Yeah, probably. Also, shut up.[sr]Think about it from Kaoru's perspective.

[charaFace A 5]

＠Jeanne Alter
There was nothing she could do about her brother going missing, or about being taken in by some creepy old guy from the old court.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
It doesn't matter how nice her new life was, she was still a bird in a gilded cage. She must've had to bury her feelings deep down just to get through the day.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
That's why I wanted Kaoru to stop suffering in silence.
