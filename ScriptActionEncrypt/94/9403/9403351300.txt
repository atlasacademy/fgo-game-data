The modern world has some fascinating traditions of its own. I don't dislike it. Quite the opposite, in fact.[wait tVoice]

Presents are grand. I no longer think anything of tribute, but I like the idea of gifts given with intent.[wait tVoice]

I, too, once gave many gifts to the one I loved.[wait tVoice]

＠Caesar
[tVoice ValVoice_101300 0_V050]
And the gifts I received in turn were innumerable. Indeed, they were love itself! As proof, behold my physique. Not a single bit of love wasted![wait tVoice]

I believe she called it the Pharaoh Cooking Style. The numerous dishes she cooked were truly sumptuous.[wait tVoice]

Whenever I visited Alexandria, I would be sure to stock up on her love.[wait tVoice]

If I close my eyes, I can still remember the delicious sights and smells...[wait tVoice]

？1：Here, you can stock up on this, too.
？2：It's not Pharaoh cooking, but here, have some chocolate!

I also like its faint traces of bitterness. You have my gratitude, Master. I never expected you would let me stock up on love like this once again.[wait tVoice]
