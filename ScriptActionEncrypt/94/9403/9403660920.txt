Well here, why don't you have a seat next to me then?[sr]It's a lovely view.

＠Reines
I'm grateful to you, you know.
[k]

＠Reines
Truth be told, if you hadn't been here,[sr]seeing my brother dead would have wrecked me.
[k]

＠Reines
If I hadn't had to keep it together enough to do something to help my pupil, I'd probably still be standing there, staring at his body.
[k]

＠Reines
At least, until one of the automata[sr]picked me off or something.
[k]

？1：I don't know what I would've done without your help, either.
？2：I'm so relieved that El-Melloi is alive.

Well, uh, you know...[sr]Ugh, shit, it's so hard not to be honest around you.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Reines
Maybe it's because I've never had a pupil before.[sr]Anyway...I think I'm pretty happy right now.
[k]

＠Reines
Gray is here, my brother's still alive,[sr]and amazingly, I get the chance to talk to both of them again.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Reines
Just don't tell my brother. I'm only saying this because you're my very first pupil.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Reines
Once this is all over, you, me, Gray, and my brother should all have tea together. I think that'll be worth breaking out my special stash for.
[k]

？1：That sounds great.

＠Reines
Make sure to keep your schedule open. Even if you are mankind's last Master, there's always time for tea.
[k]

？2：Should I bring some sweets or something?

[charaFace A 8]

＠Reines
Oh? If you think you can bring something that even remotely compares to my special tea, then by all means, go right ahead.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Reines
Anyway, I'm going to hang out here a little longer.[sr]You should go back in before you catch a cold.

I take it you were just spending time with Reines?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠El-Melloi II
I know my adoptive sister can be fairly ill-tempered, so I'm glad to see you getting along so well with her.
[k]

？1：She's a good person.
？2：She definitely likes to tease sometimes, but I can handle that.

？！

＠El-Melloi II
I see. I suppose you would have to feel that way to get along with her. I knew you were a good Master.

While we're here, there's something[sr]else I need to tell you.

...There's no need for you to resolve this Singularity.

I'm glad you're here, Gray.[sr]You should hear this too.[bgm BGM_EVENT_11 0.1]
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
As I'm sure you already know, Master, whatever happens in a Singularity eventually ends up never having happened at all.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
There are, of course, some Singularities that could threaten humanity if they take a turn for the worse, but that's not the case with this one. It's bound to go away on its own in time.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
There's no way a Singularity that has to consume memories[line 2]an ultimately self-destructive process[line 2]to sustain itself could last for very long, after all.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠El-Melloi II
Once you've reestablished contact with Chaldea and are able to return home, there won't be any reason for you to stay and continue fighting here.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠El-Melloi II
Just put it down like a video game you've grown tired of, and you need not be in any danger.
[k]

？1：I'd never do that.

[charaFace C 1]

＠El-Melloi II
You're a very straight shooter, aren't you.[sr]It's rather refreshing.
[k]

？2：You're a completionist aren't you.

＠El-Melloi II
Of course. I always try to complete whatever I start,[sr]and follow up by sending detailed feedback to the developer.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
By the way, add “II” when you call my name.[sr]My mentor's name alone is a little rich for my blood.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 0]

＠El-Melloi II
Anyway, I guess I didn't need to tell you that after all, if you're that determined to see this through.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠El-Melloi II
Some people might call you reckless or even foolish, but I think it's actually one of your strengths, and as your Servant, I swear to do all I can to assist.

Wait, of course. Something must have been interfering with our perception.

If the Clock Tower were still around, there's no way they would ignore a huge case like this.

That's not the Clock Tower at all. That's...
