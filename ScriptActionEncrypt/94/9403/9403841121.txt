Aya, I...[sr]I'm scared of Kagetora...

＠Nagao Harukage
[charaTalk A]
Even after all that time studying at the temple, she hasn't changed a bit from how she was as a child.
[k]

＠Aya
[charaTalk A]
Don't be silly, Brother. Of course she has.
[k]

＠Aya
[charaTalk A]
She has embraced the ways of Buddhism, studied the sutras, and become a humble, unfailingly polite warrior.
[k]

＠Nagao Harukage
[charaTalk A]
Embraced the ways of Buddhism?[sr]You can't possibly believe that.
[k]

＠Nagao Harukage
[charaTalk A]
You know as well as I do that she has no soul!
[k]

＠Nagao Harukage
[charaTalk A]
She's just imitating the way she thinks humans are supposed to behave!
[k]

＠Nagao Harukage
[charaTalk A]
But her eyes...[sr]Those are the eyes of a monster beyond human ken.
[k]

＠Nagao Harukage
[charaTalk A]
I fear those eyes...just like Father did...
[k]

＠Aya
[charaTalk A]
...You should get some rest, Brother.
[k]

＠Nagao Harukage
[charaTalk A]
Even now...
[k]

＠Nagao Harukage

I fear Kagetora's eyes far more[sr]than I do the gods or the Buddha...
