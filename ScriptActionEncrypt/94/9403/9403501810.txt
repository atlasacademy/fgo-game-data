If we continue on from the precepts against killing and falsehoods, then I think this floor's theme...is the precept against intoxication.

Yes. Each is the name of one of Buddhism's five precepts[line 2]doctrines that describe things one must not do if one wishes to attain enlightenment.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Fusesshoukai is the precept against killing. Fumougokai is the precept against lying. And Fuonjukai is the precept against drinking alcohol.
[k]

[charaFace F 7]

So, if we keep that in mind, and think back[sr]to what we've done on each floor so far...

...that would mean this Ooku wants us to[sr]proceed by breaking these precepts, no?

By that token, it would be impossible for us to proceed if we DO follow these precepts.

I am uncertain why these are the constraints by which we are bound here, but if Kama did build the Ooku with them in mind, she must have had a reason for doing so.

＠Sessyoin Kiara
If that is true, then I thought it might be dangerous to simply go along with whatever she has planned.

＠Sessyoin Kiara
That is why I declined their invitations earlier.

[charaFace F 4]

But we absolutely cannot let Master die.
