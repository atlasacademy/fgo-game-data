Well, like Mr. Babbage said,[sr]that Rhongomyniad is a fake.

Whoever's behind all this probably took the[sr]image of it from [%1]'s memories...

...and fashioned it into an impenetrable[sr]stronghold to hide out in.

But since it's still based on an image of the real Rhongomyniad, I should be able to interfere with it at least a little.
