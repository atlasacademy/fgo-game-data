...Senpai! Senpai, can you hear me!?[bgm BGM_EVENT_81 0.1]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Mash
That's it! We have a connection!
[k]


？1：Mash!
？2：Man, am I ever glad to hear from Chaldea!
？！






＠Mash
Senpai! We finally got through...[sr]I'm so glad you're all right!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Mash
I've been monitoring your vitals, but I still don't[sr]know what happened there. Could you please fill me in?
[k]



？1：El-Melloi's been...murdered...
？2：I'd forgotten all about Chaldea.

？！

[charaFace B 6]

＠Mash
El-Melloi is dead, and you lost your memory?[sr]That's awful!

＠Mash
I'm so sorry. In that case, I guess[sr]I had better explain what's going on.
[k]

＠Mash
You Rayshifted to London at the turn of the nineteenth century to repair a Singularity that had broken out there.
[k]

？1：So I'm in nineteenth-century London right now?
？2：You mean, from the Fourth Singularity?

？！

＠Mash
Not exactly, but its coordinates were very close to the Fourth Singularity, yes. And it's not unusual for a repaired Singularity to create small ripples like this.
[k]

＠Mash
So now that Novum Chaldea is Rayshift-worthy,[sr]we decided to have you come here to take care of it...
[k]


？1：Did El-Melloi come along too?

？！

＠Mash
Yes. Lord El-Melloi II was chosen to accompany[sr]you because of his expansive knowledge of London.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Mash
But during the Rayshift, we suddenly lost our connection and ended up losing track of your signals.
[k]

＠Mash
I...I had no idea you were going[sr]through something like that.

I'm sorry. I should keep going.

[charaFace B 8]

＠Mash
Things are still extremely unstable right now, but thankfully, we're getting just enough data to verify your existence.
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Mash
Though we had to rewire the system to focus[sr]on only me just to reestablish comms.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Mash
So I'm the only one who can talk to you right now,[sr]and I don't think it'll last much longer.
[k]

？1：Way to go, Mash!
？2：I'm sorry you had to go to so much trouble on my behalf.

？！

Nice to meet you, Ms. Reines.[sr]I've seen your name in our database before.

＠Mash
Unfortunately, our current situation[sr]is kind of...complicated...

＠Reines
Yes, I can imagine, thanks to the memories I've regained. If this has to do with parallel worlds, I don't need to know about it.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Reines
I might be a recently summoned Pseudo-Servant myself, but information like that can be as tricky to handle as a bomb. I'd just as soon not bother with it if I don't have to.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Reines
I'll have you fill me in if truly necessary, of course, but at this point, I'd say the risks outweigh the potential benefits.
[k]

＠Reines
To put it in Clock Tower terms, let's just stick[sr]to areas where we can both help each other out.

Thank you for understanding.[sr]I think that's a very wise decision.
[k]

＠Mash
Thanks to our reestablished comms,[sr]I've finally been able to get accurate data.
[k]

＠Mash
Though unfortunately, Senpai, I'm afraid you'll need to find what's causing that Singularity before you can escape...
[k]

？1：Nothing I haven't done before.
？2：It's okay. I'm used to it.

？！

[charaFace B 7]

＠Mash
Thank you, Senpai. I promise I'll do everything[sr]I can to provide you with support from here!
[k]

＠Mash
Getting right into it, there was a change in that Singularity's topography not too long ago. Can you check it out on your end?

Now that we have a capable new ally helping us,[sr]my little pupil, what do you say we look into this!?
