Thus, I suggest the Chaldea Security Organization's first order of business is to gather more information about the situation.

We still might not know right from left here, but now that you're a daimyo, Senpai, it's incumbent upon you to ensure your domain is stable.

Our domain is currently surrounded by three other Nobunagas, and we have little in the way of influence or soldiers.

It's no exaggeration to say ours is the weakest of all the daimyos' domains.

＠D：Infantrywoman Nobbu
Speaking as someone from Owari,[sr]Echigo seems way too remote to be useful.

Echigo isn't destitute by any means, if I may say so.[sr]One of its best resources is its ramie.
[k]

＠E：Chief Retainer Mash
Exactly. In our history, Kagetora built a thriving textile industry in Echigo thanks to its ramie plants.
[k]

＠E：Chief Retainer Mash
We should be able to fund our army by trading that ramie in this history as well.
