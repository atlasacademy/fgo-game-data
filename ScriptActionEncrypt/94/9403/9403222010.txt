...I've heard of “thinking outside the box,”[sr]but that's not just outside, it's outlandish.

Still... The monkeys have stopped making trouble.[sr]I wonder why they started in the first place...

Oh, this must be the place. I finally found it.

＠Hunchbacked Old Man
Pardon me, young lady. I couldn't help but[sr]overhear you talking about the monkeys.
[k]

＠Hunchbacked Old Man
I hope you can forgive them for any mischief they caused. I'm afraid I'm the one to blame for that.

I heard through the grapevine that there was a kind sparrow in dire straits, you see.
[k]

＠Hunchbacked Old Man
So I asked the monkeys to take some of my things to her in the hope that they might be helpful.
[k]

＠Hunchbacked Old Man
Unfortunately, it seems they kept forgetting the purpose of their trip on the way...
[k]

＠Hunchbacked Old Man
Still, they never brought the packages back to me, so I do think they left them where they were supposed to...
[k]

＠Hunchbacked Old Man
Did you receive them okay?
