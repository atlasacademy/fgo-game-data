＠Mash
In spite of everything, I feel so fortunate that we're able to celebrate another year together.
[k]

？2：Here's to another great year together.

[charaFace B 13]

＠Mash
I know I still have a lot to learn, but I'll do my best to improve so I can be of even more help.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
I'm so grateful to Sion and Captain for building this new Wandering Sea Chaldea Base for us.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Mash
There was only so much room in the Shadow Border, after all. Now we can relax and celebrate holidays like we used to.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Mash
We can even resummon Servants, now that the Spirit Origin graph is connected to Trismegistus II.
[k]

＠Mash
Right now, we're still limited to Heroic Spirits with well-defined Spirit Origin graph entries...
[k]

＠Mash
...but I'm hopeful we'll reach a point where we can summon as many as possible and keep them on standby.
[k]

＠Mash
As for the Servants' memories...
[k]

＠Mash
...usually, Heroic Spirits don't carry over records of previous deeds, even if resummoned by the same mage.
[k]

＠Mash
But in our case...
[k]

＠Mash
...it sounds like everyone registered in the graph will carry over most of their records from Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace B 13]

＠Mash
We can thank Da Vinci for that.
[k]

＠Mash
After we got the order from the Mage's Association to dismiss the Servants, she ensured our contracts with them were temporarily frozen instead of annulled...
[k]

＠Mash
...then she meticulously engraved each and every one[sr]of their records into the Spirit Origin graph by hand.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Mash
I was kind of taken aback when we[sr]resummoned the Orleans Case team...
[k]

＠Mash
...and Kiyohime immediately glomped you,[sr]which prompted Elisabeth to dropkick her...
[k]

[charaFace B 13]

＠Mash
But I was also relieved to see that our history together really had been preserved.
[k]

？1：Me too.
？2：It really was the work of a genius, wasn't it...

？！


＠Mash
Leonardo da Vinci poured both her genius and her very heart into inscribing every last Servant.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Mash
If it wasn't for her...we would never have[sr]been able to resummon them like this.
[k]

＠Mash
After the Incineration of Humanity situation was solved, she worked on the graph for the entire year she served as acting director.
[k]

＠Mash
She protected everything Dr. Roman entrusted to her, without ever losing her good cheer.

Chaldea is officially on winter break for the next week, at Da Vinci's suggestion.

Although Holmes also said yesterday that it would be nice to spend New Year's dozing in an armchair...

Definitely. Even without Chaldeas, it is possible to Rayshift as long as we have Trismegistus and Sheba.

And since my Paper Moon can stand in for Sheba,[sr]we should not have an issue.

There is a limit to how far back we can go, as we do not have the capacity to verify existences as effectively as Chaldeas.

Glad you asked. As it turns out, there is a Singularity happening even as we speak.

Yes, even with the world completely wiped clean.

We could ignore it for now, given that history being erased is a much more pressing matter...
