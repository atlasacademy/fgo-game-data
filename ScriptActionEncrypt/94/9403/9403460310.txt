I originally contacted Diarmuid's group because[sr]I heard they were the biggest player here...

[charaFace D 0]

Not to mention that between the three of us mages,[sr]my family's got the shortest history.

You don't mince words, do you!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Alexander
But, you're not wrong.

＠Alexander
Mages are all about passing power down through generations. My family's only been at it for three hundred years.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Alexander
But those two have families that go back[sr]five hundred and seven hundred years.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 0]

＠Alexander
...That said, my magecraft is pretty well-suited to combat, so that could tip the scales in my favor.
[k]

Yup.[sr]You know about centaurs, right?
[k]

＠Alexander
The legendary half-human, half-horse creatures?
[k]

？1：Yeah, sure do!
？！

[charaFace D 1]

＠Alexander
I'm sure they were incredibly fast, but that's not the only reason they were so strong.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Alexander
No, they were strong because they focused all of their attention on pinpoint precision with their arrows, even while running at those incredible speeds.
[k]

＠Alexander
Concentration is key.[sr]Not just in magecraft, but in everything.
[k]

＠Alexander
If people could concentrate like a centaur, it would improve their abilities tenfold across the board.
[k]

＠Alexander
Even if you don't have a lot of magical energy to work with, if you focus, you could squeeze every last drop you have right into your magical circuits.
[k]

Whether that's true or not, I do know that both his magical crest and his magical circuits are stellar.

If that's true, it would seem to have very narrow applications, but I suppose it would also be rather difficult to predict.

Thank you for the drink. It was delicious. I think I will go see if Alexander would be amenable to working together.

Oh, up already?[sr]It's not even daybreak yet.

I see. [wt 0.7][charaFace A 3][sr]Hmm. In that case...

[charaFace A 0]

＠Moriarty
In truth, much of my life was actually quite dull.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Moriarty
What's that? Is it because I'm a fictional character?[sr]I'm not so sure.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Moriarty
AM I a fictional character?
[k]

＠Moriarty
Or did James Moriarty truly exist at some point?
[k]

＠Moriarty
Did the events that make up my past truly happen?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Moriarty
...At this point, that is really not so[sr]important a distinction as you might think.

All that really matters is that I'm here now.

...My childhood memories are all rather hazy.
[k]

＠
There is only one thing that[sr]I remember from them: equations.
[k]

＠
I remember their cleanliness. The beauty inherent in their structure. How gentle they could be...and how terrifying.
[k]

＠
It is thanks to equations that one can determine precisely where a ball will land once thrown.
[k]

＠
...I think, back when I was just a boy, I would often ponder why no one else seemed to realize their appeal.

Once I had reached what most would[sr]consider an adult age, I wrote a book:

But it never saw the light of day, thanks to the mathematicians who saw it buried before it took off.
[k]

＠
But honestly, I can't say I was surprised.
[k]

＠
I knew all too well how petty[sr]and guarded people could be.
[k]

＠
All the more so once they realized the terrifying implications of my book.
[k]

＠
Still, despite my lack of surprise, I was at a loss as to how to respond. How, then, was I to verify the equation therein?
[k]

I remember cocking my head and thinking to myself,[sr]“Now what am I going to do?”

＠
I didn't want to go my whole life without ever knowing if that equation was correct or not.
[k]

＠
This may make me sound like a petulant child...but I simply did not like that idea. Not one bit.
[k]

＠
I was sure I could prove my equation was correct.[sr]I HAD to prove it was correct.
[k]

＠
So I decided to turn to evil.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Moriarty
Hmm, I suppose I cannot possibly expect[sr]you to understand that part, no.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Moriarty
I wanted to prove beyond all doubt how[sr]beautiful and terrifying my equation was.
[k]

＠Moriarty
So I swore I would do whatever I must to make that happen, and eliminate anyone who stood in my way.
[k]

＠Moriarty
From there, I devoted myself solely[sr]to calculating one thing:
[k]

＠Moriarty
How could I go about proving this[sr]equation to the world at large?
[k]

＠Moriarty
And the conclusion I reached[sr]was that I must turn to evil.
[k]

＠Moriarty
As an evil man, I would use this equation[sr]to wreak destruction upon the world.
[k]

＠Moriarty
My next step was to form an organization.
[k]

＠Moriarty
I mixed intricate schemes into evil that typically tended toward straightforward simplicity.
[k]

＠Moriarty
I provided wisdom and intelligence to evil that typically resorted to brute strength and violence.
[k]

＠Moriarty
I piled up evil deeds upon evil deeds, until one day...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

...that accursed detective brought me to justice.

[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Moriarty
From my perspective, I thought I was just advising everyone to take notice of me.
[k]

＠Moriarty
But once they started calling me “genius,” “scum,” “morally bankrupt,” “monster,” and “the Napoleon of crime”...
[k]

＠Moriarty
There is one[line 2]no, two reasons for that.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Moriarty
I enjoyed myself immensely.[sr]Yes, I admit it: I truly AM morally bankrupt.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Moriarty
But in spite of that, or perhaps because of it, I can say without a doubt that few have enjoyed their lives so thoroughly as I enjoyed mine.
[k]

＠Moriarty
It was grand fun to see people playing into my hands, and even more fun to see them falling into my traps.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Moriarty
Watching them stumble off a cliff, or trip on a pebble, or have a vase come crashing down on them, were some of the greatest moments of hilarity I ever witnessed!

[charaFace A 0]

Indeed.

＠Moriarty
Of course, it isn't as though I was[sr]riding high for the rest of my life.
[k]

＠Moriarty
I met my end tumbling down the Reichenbach Falls.
[k]

＠Moriarty
It was a miserable end, but properly befitting a criminal like myself. And to make matters worse, the man I tried to drag down with me ended up surviving.
[k]

＠Moriarty
I remember how ashy gray the sky was that day, at a time that was neither morning nor evening. How the icy cold waters seemed to scream like machine-gun fire.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Moriarty
It's quite strange, really.[sr]Why in the world did I challenge him to a fistfight?
[k]

If I am merely fictional, then I'm sure I did so purely to satisfy the demands of the plot. But if I did actually exist, then I think I understand.
