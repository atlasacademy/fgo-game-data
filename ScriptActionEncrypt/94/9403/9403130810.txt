＠Bradamante
A killer finisher, huh... I love the sound of that. It has its own unique flavor, even different than a Noble Phantasm.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Bradamante
I'll admit, I was a little jealous whenever[sr]I saw the others double-teaming us...
[k]

？1：(So honest!)
？2：(I know what she means...)
？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Bradamante
So I welcome this challenge! I'll endure any training it takes to learn our own killer finisher, no matter how harsh!

＠Bradamante
I mean, I might have a little difficulty with being trapped and abandoned in an illusory garden, or other trials of mental fortitude...
[k]

＠Bradamante
...but I'm great at physical obstacles, like climbing out of deep pits! I'm a lot tougher than I look!

We'll use these big trees I just pulled[sr]out of the ground as training dummies.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Think of the trees' roots as your opponent's[sr]feet, and their branches as arms.

So the idea is to float the dummies down the river, and land the move on them when they go down the waterfall.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

Very well. I'll take care of[sr]that part of your training.

I see... So we need to land the move on the dummy, all without succumbing to the waterfall's intense pressure.
[k]

＠Bradamante
And not only that, we have to[sr]do so at exactly the same time...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Bradamante
Okay, let's do it! We may not have much time, but I'll do whatever it takes to make sure this new move is ready by our next match!
