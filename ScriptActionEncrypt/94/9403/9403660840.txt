You might have already figured this out, but let me get this out of the way: these Mnemosyne papers are a trap.

I can understand your confusion, but think about it.[sr]A normal Servant would never leave a body behind.
[k]

？1：Oh, yeah, that's true, isn't it.
？2：But, you're not a normal Servant, right?

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠El-Melloi II
So you remember that now, [%1]? Yes, Zhuge[sr]Liang uses my body for a vessel, making me a Pseudo-Servant.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
So as long as certain conditions are in place, it is possible for me to leave a body behind in the event of my death. That is what I took advantage of here.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠El-Melloi II
Since I essentially have two Spirit Origins,[sr]I used my Zhuge Liang one to create that body.

It wasn't easy, believe me. And in consequence,[sr]most of Zhuge Liang's power is now gone.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠El-Melloi II
But in this case, losing most of Zhuge Liang's power and Spirit Origin also has some significant upsides.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
It was impossible for the enemy to track me in this state, regardless of how sharp their sensors might be.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠El-Melloi II
After all, no one would expect a tactician of Zhuge Liang's caliber to only have as much magical energy as a common mage.

＠El-Melloi II
I've been using the time I bought to analyze them, and I learned something very interesting in the process.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠El-Melloi II
Memories in this Singularity possess[sr]some highly unusual properties.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
For one thing, memories don't normally have much in the way of magical energy, but here, they can provide vast amounts of it.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
Conversely, this paper uses massive magical[sr]energy to manipulate others' memories.
[k]

？1：Manipulate memories?
？2：You mean, it can change them?

？！

＠El-Melloi II
That's right. This paper fabricates memories.[sr]That's been the true goal here all along.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠El-Melloi II
Yes, I expect your memories were initially[sr]stolen when you first entered this Singularity.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠El-Melloi II
But stealing memories is one thing.[sr]Fabricating completely new ones is quite another.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
You've already remembered some things by encountering Servants you've met in the past here, haven't you?
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
That's exactly why the one behind this had to employ more cunning measures to overwrite your memories.

＠El-Melloi II
They hid these pieces of paper in each patchwork[sr]explicitly to have their target collect them [&himself:herself].
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
Having the target collect them of [&his:her] own volition[sr]enables things that would normally never fly to sneak past without suspicion.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
I expect the mastermind kept the first two pieces practically identical to the target's memories, only to plant a complete fabrication in the third.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠El-Melloi II
Magecraft and Mystics are fundamentally[sr]built upon that kind of deceit.
[k]

？1：But still, fabricating memories? It just doesn't seem possible...
？2：That does make sense, but there's still something off about earlier...

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠El-Melloi II
Are you sure about that? Did you confirm[sr]the veracity of those memories with anyone?

＠El-Melloi II
I see. True, Chaldea almost certainly could determine whether [%1]'s memories are genuine or falsified.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
So on that note, I have a question for you.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
I'm sure you've received a transmission or two from Chaldea by now, but I'm guessing Mash is the only one there you could speak to, right?
[k]

？1：...!
？2：You don't mean...

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠El-Melloi II
Fabricating memory is a difficult endeavor. Even after you've managed to implant new ones, you need to keep a close eye on them to see how well they took.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
So the one behind this would need to do just that, as well as make sure you stuck to the path they wanted you to follow.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠El-Melloi II
And the best way to do so is under the guise of someone you trust completely. Someone you would never suspect.

For our mastermind to impersonate staff from Chaldea,[sr]they would of course need information on Chaldea.

＠El-Melloi II
And it would be impossible for someone native to this Singularity to obtain that information.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
That means whoever is behind everything wouldn't be able to do all this with only information obtained in this Singularity. They must have a connection on the outside.
