The sound of the brook babbling outside... The singing of the early morning birds... It certainly is a peaceful morning, isn't it, Senpai?

＠Mash
Oh, don't worry about the futon.[sr]I'll put it away so you can focus on getting ready.
[k]

＠Mash
We still have another twenty minutes until we're supposed to meet up, so we should still have time to relax with a cup of tea before we head to the lobby.
[k]

？1：Thanks, Mash. Okay, I'll go wash my face then.
？2：Man, who knew taking care of an inn was this much work...

Something about Enma-tei forces Servants to manifest like we have normal lives. Almost like incarnation...

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
The Enma-tei isn't just a mountain inn;[sr]it's an inn of the spiritual world.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Travelers that end up here aren't lost. They're wanderers who happened to step into another world.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
One day, you find yourself cut off from your own world, enjoy a period where you never age a day...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...and when you finally go back to your original world, you find that decades have passed...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
It's the textbook example of being spirited away, just like the Dragon Palace or the Peach Blossom Spring.

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
I see. That sounds much like one of our own stories.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Though ours involves a type of changeling, where a human child is kidnapped and turned into a fairy.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Fairies have their own unique way of seeing things,[sr]and will sometimes lure humans into their world.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Such humans become ageless while in the other world, but they inevitably pay the price for their dream all at once upon returning to reality.

Are you speaking of Tír na nÓg[line 2]the Land of the Young, Fionn mac Cumhaill?

No, no, nothing like that. Tír na nÓg may be the[sr]Land of Fairies, but it is still part of our world.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
It is merely detached from it, much like a Reality Marble, or like a dream being had by the very planet.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Whether that dream is a good one or a bad one depends on what the fairy in question happens to be like.

Of course, you did manage to take one for a wife.[sr]I take it she was drawn to those golden locks of yours?

Hahaha, I'll tell you about Sadhbh some other time.[sr]It's difficult to stop once I begin talking about her.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
At the moment, we are here to discuss the Enma-tei. Have any of you learned anything since our arrival?
[k]

＠Diarmuid
Yes, my lord. The demonic monkeys have been engaging in mischief on a much wider scale than we thought.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
They attack the sparrows throughout the mountain, and interfere with their efforts to collect the so-called bounties of the mountain and the river.

The demonic monkeys running about are certainly a problem, but the Enma-tei itself has issues as well.
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
First and foremost is, as we all know[sr]by now, the drought of customers.
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
It is also because of that drought that many[sr]of the inn's facilities have been closed off.

That may not be an issue at the moment, but if we're going to bring in more guests, we'll also need to bring back all the other facilities.
