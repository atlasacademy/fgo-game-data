＠Sion
The Spirit Origin graph is still working,[sr]but we cannot summon a single Servant.
[k]

＠Sion
And there is not a single member of Chaldea's staff anywhere in the base, let alone the Command Room.
[k]

＠Sion
Even my Servant, Captain, is gone.[sr]We are the only ones left.
[k]

＠Sion
Whether this is due to external interference or internal sabotage, there is clearly ill intent at work.

？！

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 4]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]

＠Sion
I still need to investigate more thoroughly before I can say exactly what happened, but it is already clear what the culprit used to accomplish this.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Sion
It was Rayshifting. They used Rayshifting to induce forced Spiritron summoning.
[k]

＠Sion
To put it in layman's terms, my Coffin was used as a catalyst with which to forcefully Rayshift everyone away.

＠Mash
What!?[sr]I-is that even possible!?
[k]

[charaFace B 18]

＠Sion
I am sure it would be with Chaldeas,[sr]but this is Novum Chaldea.
[k]

＠Sion
There is no phase navigational system that advanced here.
[k]

＠Sion
So it would be impossible to reverse-summon by hijacking our system.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Sion
Usually, I would be ninety-nine percent sure about that conclusion...
[k]

＠Sion
But...I do have a theory or two on[sr]how it could possibly happen...
[k]

＠Sion
However, they are so absurd that I decided to shelve them for now. Next time, I will not be so quick to criticize how Holmes handles situations like this.
[k]

[charaFace B 15]

＠Sion
I mean...if this were a locked room murder mystery, it would be as if the killer was the greatest pitcher in the entire universe, and they killed the victim by throwing a ball through an air vent.
[k]

＠Sion
That is how unlikely the circumstances would need to be for that to happen. Though that said, I suppose if the universe's greatest pitcher were actually here, then it would technically be possible...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Sion
...Sorry, getting sidetracked. Back on point, we are the only ones capable of fighting back against this attack.
[k]

＠Sion
[%1], Mash, and myself, Sion Eltnam Sokaris.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
...Who could the attacker be?[sr]And why in the world would they do this?
[k]

[charaFace B 18]

＠Sion
I cannot say anything about that just yet.
[k]

＠Sion
That said, I do not think one of the Crypters is behind this, since they have no reason to leave their Lostbelts.
[k]

＠Sion
I also still have a faint connection[sr]to my own Servant, Captain.
[k]

＠Sion
So the fact that he has yet to take any action must mean that he is trapped.
[k]

＠Sion
And I would guess that all of Chaldea's staff and Servants are as well.
[k]

？1：Are they okay!?

？！

[charaFace A 15]

＠Mash
That's what I want to know, too.[sr]Not everyone on Chaldea's staff is a mage.
[k]

＠Mash
If...if they really were Rayshifted, then[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Sion
I see. You are worried they may be unable to withstand the Rayshift, and disappear upon reaching their destination.
[k]

＠Sion
I cannot deny that such a worst-case[sr]scenario is possible...
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Sion
...but in this case, I do not think you need to worry, as their Rayshift destination does not appear to belong to standard history.
[k]

＠Sion
That is, they are moving through space more than time, so my Coffin will have no trouble verifying their existence.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Sion
Of course, I cannot guarantee their safety if they should encounter some sort of violence at their destination...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Sion
...but if all the culprit wished to do was hurt them, they would not need to go to the trouble of Rayshifting them.
[k]

＠Sion
So, thinking logically, I suspect the culprit's goal was to summon and capture them, not kill them.
[k]

＠Sion
If I were the culprit, I would have frozen them the moment they were summoned and kept them packaged as Spiritrons.
[k]

＠Sion
I have to do that for the people with low Rayshift aptitude anyway, and it would also stop the Servants from fighting back.
[k]

＠Sion
Since they are already being converted during the Rayshift process, that would definitely be the most efficient way to capture them.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
Then...there's still a chance we can save them?
[k]

？1：Since they Rayshifted...does that mean you know where they went?
？！

[charaFace B 7]

＠Sion
Of course![sr]That is the most important part, after all!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Sion
When I got to the Command Room, all of the Rayshift equipment was already set to fixed parameters.
[k]

＠Sion
To put it another way, they are all pointing[sr]towards a very specific set of coordinates.
[k]

＠Sion
And since everyone was reverse-summoned away, this almost certainly means that someone or something is at those coordinates.
[k]

＠Sion
Though of course, I cannot say if the culprit just forgot to cover their tracks, there was nothing they could do to hide them, or they left them here on purpose to lure us in.
[k]

＠Mash
Where are these coordinates, exactly? Does this mean...they point to a Singularity from the past?
[k]

[charaFace B 14]

＠Sion
Hmm, that is really the key problem. Remember what I said earlier about this destination not belonging to standard history?
[k]

＠Sion
It is technically a Singularity, but it is also quite different from the Singularities we have seen so far.
[k]

＠Sion
Its influence is spreading...or perhaps[sr]I should say, stretching.
[k]

＠Sion
Usually, the bizarre phenomena that take place in Singularities are confined to that Singularity...
[k]

＠Sion
...but this Singularity is trying to interfere with Proper Human History while remaining a Singularity.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Sion
In that sense, it may be closer to a Lostbelt.
[k]

＠Sion
If we think of human history as one long scroll, Singularities are like stains that weaken the scroll by contaminating the history around them.
[k]

＠Sion
Whereas Lostbelts are like another scroll entirely that was discarded once it was clear it was no longer useful...
[k]

＠Sion
It could be that this Singularity is some sort of hybrid...a Pseudo-Singularity similar to Shinjuku or Shimousa.
[k]

＠Sion
I think the most appropriate name we could give it in these specific conditions is “Humanity Destruction Zone.”
[k]

？1：...So this is a Singularity unlike any other we've seen...

？2：(If it's similar to Shinjuku...that would mean...)

＠Mash
...Right. If this Singularity is the same as Shinjuku, that would mean it came about from[line 2]
[k]

？！

＠Sion
The central coordinates for this Singularity, which is currently stretching out like a line, point to mid-seventeenth century Japan, during the Edo period.
[k]

＠Sion
The province of Shimousa you observed before is gone from history, so I expect this incident is completely unrelated.
[k]

＠Mash
...Understood. Regardless, I think[sr]there's only one option left to us.
[k]

＠Mash
Now that we know where everyone was taken, and the path to them is still open, we have to go there too.
[k]

＠Mash
From there, we need to find whoever or whatever's behind this, defeat them, and rescue everyone.
[k]

？1：Hang on, Holmes. Hang in there, Da Vinci...!
？2：Director... Meunière... I hope you guys are okay!
？！

[charaFace B 0]

＠Sion
Yes, that is true.[sr]In the end, that is what it all comes down to.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Sion
But, I am afraid I cannot let both of you go there.
[k]

＠Sion
I want you to help me, Mash. I already have my hands full observing the Singularity.
[k]

＠Sion
I need one more skilled operator who I can trust to observe and verify [%1]'s existence.
[k]

＠Sion
Someone who is capable of filling in for[sr]three Chaldea staff members on their own.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mash
I...
[k]

[charaFace A 14]

＠Mash
B-but if I do that, there will be no one left to help Senpai in the Singularity!
[k]

＠Sion
That is true. But this is a question of priorities.
[k]

＠Sion
If this were a diving expedition, it would be a decision between going down to the depths with an escort but without a diving suit, or going down with a diving suit but no escort.
[k]

＠Sion
It's not even a matter of which is safer. If we are[sr]unable to verify [&his:her] existence, [&he:she] will not be able[sr]to dive down into this other world at all.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
...But, still...going into a Singularity[sr]without even a single Servant is just...
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Sion
Yes, I do understand your concerns.[sr]But look at [%1].
[k]

？1：I'll admit, the idea of going there alone is terrifying...

[charaFace B 6]

＠Sion
Exactly. The fact is, this figurative boat we are in is on the verge of sinking, and we are all in it together.
[k]

＠Sion
As our base was already attacked once, there is no telling when those of us staying here may be attacked again.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Sion
So I am afraid our only option is for you to summon up your courage and look for either a weapon or a companion on site.
[k]

＠Sion
Fortunately, this Singularity is in seventeenth-century Japan, which by all accounts was a civilized society, so you should be able to reason with the people there.
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Sion
As long as you can get past the first hurdle, I am sure you will be able to move things along rapidly!
[k]

？1：Wait. What first hurdle?
？！

[charaFace B 16]

＠Sion
Oh come on, have you never seen a samurai movie? I mean when they draw their swords if they feel someone has behaved improperly towards them.
[k]

＠Sion
I think they call it “burei-uchi”? Gosh, imagine a society where you cannot even speak to anyone above your class for fear of being beheaded! That would be terrifying!
[k]

Most of the Singularities we've seen to date...
[k]

＠Mash
...were caused by a massive magical energy[sr]resource, typically a Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Mash
So if you find something like that here too,[sr]you may need to take it into custody.
[k]

？1：No problem. Been there, done that, got the Mystic Code.
？2：Okay, but what about, you know, the other problem?

＠Sion
True, I guess I do not have to tell you that that particular goal is just the official party line, at least in one sense.
[k]

＠Sion
I mostly just said it to cover our bases, like an alibi![sr]Just keep it in mind so you do not forget it entirely.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Sion
The other goal is, of course, much more[sr]important, and much more urgent:
[k]

＠Sion
Rescuing all of the Chaldea personnel and Servants currently trapped there.

We still have another huge problem we need to take care of. Namely, resolving the bleached Earth phenomenon.
[k]

＠Sion
This order may be much smaller in comparison,[sr]but it is an important step nonetheless.
[k]

[charaFace B 11]

＠Sion
This enemy has launched a direct attack on Chaldea.[sr]There is only one thing for us to do in response.
[k]

[charaFace B 17]

＠Sion
Counterattack, counterattack,[sr]and counterattack some more!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Sion
By doing so, we will fortify our position for the upcoming Grand Order.
[k]

＠Sion
So I hope you understand that this Rayshift is a crucial trial for all of us at Novum Chaldea!
[k]

？1：Roger that!
？2：I promise to come back with everyone safe and sound!
？！

[charaFace B 2]

＠Sion
Good! Then as this Rayshift's supervisor, I hereby declare that this emergency directive[line 2]this Counter Order, is underway!
