At this rate, Arai Hakuseki and Manabe Akifusa will be able to do whatever they want with the government. That little boy, the shogun? What a joke.[sr]He's a figurehead, nothing more...

As I suspected, the database says that was the name of another future shogun. It looks like Ietsugu was the seventh in the Tokugawa lineage.

Ahem! As goddesses, we cannot go around telling others what the future has in store without a very good reason. That could create all kinds of problems.

So I hope you will understand that we cannot answer that question.

That's fine then. I don't need to hear more. Just knowing that the Tokugawa line continues on is enough for me.
