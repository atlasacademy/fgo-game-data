＠Beni-Enma
Oh, sorry, I shouldn't be happy about that.[sr]But I can tell you're being considerate.
[k]

？！

＠Beni-Enma
We all come from different worlds, each with their own set of values. You have yours, Mash has hers, Tamamo and the others have theirs...
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
It may seem like there's only one world, but it's actually divided into many different sections. What humans call hell is just another one of them.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Cheep. The thoughts, values, and ethics of each society are what shapes that society's afterlife.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
For example, hell in your country and hell in[sr]Mr. Fionn's country are very different things.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Beni-Enma
Humans have wanted to cope with the inevitability of death ever since they came into being.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
The particular laws and customs may[sr]differ between tribes and cultures...
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
...but the idea that when they die, bad people are punished, and good people find salvation...
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
...has always been a constant in each[sr]and every country you could find, chirp.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Of course, these were always things taught to keep society running smoother for the living, not to describe what hell was actually like.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
To encourage people to live good, clean lives by promising they would find happiness after death.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
It all stemmed from obvious morals[line 2]the kind that anyone could agree were right and proper.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Beni-Enma
It isn't usually hell's business to meddle with human society, or to determine what was right and wrong...
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Beni-Enma
...but our hell is sensitive to trends, so we tend to incorporate a lot of human religious values.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
They say hell and Earth used to be connected, that you could conceivably walk between them. That sounds rather inefficient as a land of death to me, though.

Anyway, since mankind couldn't conquer death, they began to change how they thought about it, chirp.

Once death was no longer something special[sr]that was to be feared, hell changed, too.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Beni-Enma
Or, put another way, that was when[sr]it became an unpopular fantasy.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Humans no longer feared hell, nor thought they even required one, and the idea of seeking salvation in hell was lost.

The hell I grew up in was a hell that[sr]had long since fallen behind the times.

Warm blankets. Plentiful food.[sr]A world without any adults to berate her.

She did wonder why the mansion was there all alone[line 2]why there was not a single person to be found...
[k]

＠
...but she smiled when she saw that at least the mansion had friends in the sparrows that fluttered about its yard.
[k]

＠
The girl drifted between the mansion's many guest rooms, holding her breath as if she were afraid she might wake up and find it had all been a dream.
[k]

＠
She then put her hands together in[sr]prayer to give thanks to the Buddha.
[k]

＠
Thank you for giving me a roof over my head before I die. Thank you for showing me something beautiful before the end.
[k]

＠
The girl then drew her last breath, a tear running down her cheeks at the mansion's beauty.
[k]

＠
She hadn't eaten in days.[sr]Her body was bruised and beaten.
[k]

＠
She had been so hungry it was a wonder she[sr]had managed to stay on her feet at all.

＠
Yet even so, she did not partake in the feast laid out before her, as during her life in captivity...

Whether the Buddha had taken pity on her, or because she hadn't eaten anything at the mansion...
[k]

＠
...the girl had been reborn as a sparrow oni in ancient hell, rather than joining the other dead.
[k]

＠
The sparrow was named Beni, or “red,” after the color of her hair, and set about working at the Sanzu.
[k]

＠
After countless years of hard work, the Supreme Judge of hell, the Great King Enma, recognized her accomplishments.
[k]

＠
He appointed her his proxy, and entrusted her with caring for the mayoiga in the world of the living.

[bgm BGM_EVENT_98 3.0]

＠Old Man
“Well now, that is something. I say, neighbor, would you be willing to let me have that sparrow for myself?”
[k]

＠
It was an old man known for being an oddball who put a lot of time and effort into impractical endeavors.
[k]

＠
As a result, the rest of the village[sr]usually kept their distance from him.
[k]

＠
This latest endeavor suited his penchant for impracticality quite well.
[k]

＠
He convinced the old woman to make a trade:[sr]the crying sparrow for all of his life savings.
[k]

＠Sparrow
“Chirp, chirp, why did you save me? I thought humans never do anything unless it benefits them.”
[k]

＠Old Man
“I'm not sure either. But hey, you can't see someone unhappy and not try to help, right?”
[k]

＠
After treating the sparrow's wounds, the old man naturally returned her to the mountain.
[k]

＠
“Try not to get caught next time!”[sr]he said with a laugh.
[k]

Time passed, and one day, the sparrow learned[sr]that the old man had fallen on hard times.

The old man gratefully accepted the sparrow's invitation, and enjoyed his time there immensely.

But not as much as the sparrow did.

As happy as the old man was, it didn't compare to the joy the sparrow had when he had saved her long ago.

＠
A large one, and a small one.
[k]

＠
The old man tried to refuse, arguing he had already been given more than enough, but the sparrow threatened to keep him there forever unless he accepted them.

＠
So the old man humbly chose the small basket,[sr]and returned to his own world.

From then on, the basket would fill with a modest amount of happiness each and every day...

“Oh, it's all thanks to the great protector of children[line2]the mountain Jizou. He said he'd give me some happiness as long as I promised to live an honest life from now on.”

The old man wisely decided to[sr]avoid mentioning the sparrow...

[k]

＠
Some tried to live upstanding lives,[sr]and others worked to be true to themselves.
[k]

＠
Sometimes, they would lose their footing on their chosen path. Sometimes, their eyes would well up with tears of pure envy.

＠
Most of them had dreams of one sort or another that kept them going in their small, selfish, aimless days.

Those who had strayed from the path went unrewarded, however, many found their dreams came true.

And why wouldn't they, given that the old man was using every bit of happiness from his basket...

“Who'd want to hear that your happiness is all thanks to someone else? That would only make them feel bad.”

He kept on lying in the hope that doing good deeds would lead to his own happiness.

So many made-up tales. So many tall tales.[sr]So many fairy tales.
[k]

＠
The old man alone remained behind in reality, all so that he could make his many fun lies become true.

Looking back, the old man probably knew that very soon the blessed lives that the other villagers had lead would soon come to an end...

...That's why I want to properly return the favor.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
The Enma-tei is a world unto itself that[sr]connects to both the past and future...
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
So as long as I keep it going... As long as it remains, a mythical place where spirits wander... I might get to see him again someday.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Nobody else may care if the[sr]Enma-tei sticks around or not...
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
...but I still want to see him again.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I want to see his gentle smile again.[sr]I want to hear his funny stories again.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I want to impress him with how[sr]much I've improved as a cook...

...I'm sorry you had to see that. No doubt strange to see an oni crying out of nowhere, huh?

＠Beni-Enma
Thank you...for taking such good care of the Enma-tei.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I may have said I was going to close it this year,[sr]but I haven't gotten that desperate yet.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
As the phrase goes, heaven only knows. We sparrows will do the best we can with what we have.

＠Mash
...but now that we do, I can tell that the Enma-tei holds a very special place in Beni-Enma's heart.
[k]

＠Mash
Come on. We have to make sure we get all five treasures and give them back to the bamboo cutter!
