Though whether that will be a comical or tragic death is still sort of up in the air.

Writers are always juggling about ten or twenty ideas in their minds, even if they don't always get around to writing all or even most of them.
[k]

Well, ten or twenty might be giving some writers too much credit, but in Murasaki's case, I'm pretty sure she had more than her fair share.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]

＠Holmes
Hmm, I see. And you think she used one[sr]of these ideas for this movie's script?
[k]

＠Andersen
Given how urgent and unexpected the request was, it would only make sense that she would use an idea she had already been kicking around.
[k]

＠Andersen
But there were also a lot of constraints. A limited pool of actors, her lack of experience with writing screenplays, and very little time to film.
[k]

＠Andersen
I'd guess half of her premise is something she already had floating around her mind, and the other half is stuff she had to come up with to make it work.
[k]

＠Andersen
Though I do get the impression that she used[sr]up all her energy on the setting and cast.

Wet paint...
[k]

[charaFace F 2]

＠Andersen
That's it! It was Hokusai!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

Precisely. Ms. Murasaki must have asked Ms. Hokusai[sr]to paint that portrait for use as a prop.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Andersen
True, an artist as good as Hokusai would probably be able to throw a painting like that together faster than most people could open an image editor.

But I guess there wasn't enough time for the paint to dry before they had to start filming.

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Aw crap, I can't. Just standin' in front[sr]of the canvas is makin' me dizzy.

[charaFace A 15]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Maybe I been workin' myself a little too hard lately.

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Say, that's the medicine Murasaki left here. I think she said it'd relieve your exhaustion in a jiffy!
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Sounds like just what the doctor ordered!

If you don't mind, Ms. Hokusai, there's something I wish to ask you about the portrait you painted recently.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Oh, that? Came out lookin' awful good, didn't it?
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Gettin' ta feast my eyes on a handsome guy and beautiful lady like that is one of the very best parts of my work.
[k]

＠Holmes
Oh yes, your skill was never in question. It is clear for all to see that your work is eminently professional.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]

＠Holmes
However, I was curious if Ms. Murasaki made any unusual requests of you when she commissioned the piece.
[k]

＠Holmes
For example...were there any[sr]parts she asked you to redo?

[charaFace A 15]

Somethin' she asked me to redo...?

Is that how it seems to you?

[charaFace D 1]
＠Holmes
Haha, I suppose this particular case[sr]does make for a nice change of pace.

[charaFace D 0]

＠Holmes
After all, once I become involved in a case, it is only a matter of time until it is solved, however inscrutable it may appear at first blush.
[k]

＠Andersen
Hmph. So the fact that you're working on a case that isn't even really a case at this point only makes it that much more interesting for you, huh.
[k]

＠Andersen
I guess even detectives have their specialties. But, whatever. Let's head back to the Command Room, Holmes.

＠Andersen
I'm worried about how things are going on set. There's[sr]no way [%1]'ll be able to handle everything[sr]on [&his:her] own.

Not with a cast of actors whose heads are so far[sr]up their asses they haven't seen daylight in years.
