＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
I had no intention of showing myself here.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
My only purpose was to see what sort of state our guests were in.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
But...it is as I suspected. You may be following the letter of the law, but the spirit is completely absent.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
You two are no longer Ooku attendants,[sr]and the [&boy:girl] only appears to be intoxicated.

If you find it that puzzling, maybe you should have a few drinks yourself. It might at least help with your worry lines.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Even if you can't hold your liquor, you could still substitute with a cup of tea and a tasty snack.

...but only to see how Master is doing.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Why, that makes it sound as though you are more concerned with our current condition than with the fact that we have managed to come so far.
[k]

[charaFace E 8]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
That, in turn, suggests that you do not care[sr]how far we penetrate into the labyrinth...

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
We have already determined that this Ooku[sr]has a connection to the five precepts.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Thus, I will ask you only once. Nobutsuna, are you certain you do not know Kama's true objective?
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Whatever hasty reasoning may have caused you to go over to her side, you are still the man once known as Wise Izu.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
If there is an answer to this mystery,[sr]surely you must have realized it.

That sounds like you do know it.[sr]Come on, why not just tell us while we're all here then?
[k]

＠Mata Hari
Whatever this goal is, it's obviously important enough to you to turn us into your pawns and use us to make others to drink.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
So come on, tell us. After what you put us through, don't we have a right to know?

There is only one thing this floor requires of you: intoxication. Fail to drink to excess, and you will die.

You may have been able to deceive everything else on this floor, but you will have no such luck with these guards.

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
But first, let me warn you of just one more thing,[sr]so as to avoid any more foolish questions.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
Resistance is futile. Really, truly futile.[sr]None of you can hope to defy Lady Kama.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
This very Ooku was made to have you succumb. Sooner or later, you will find yourselves unable to progress unless you give in to depravity.
[k]

？1：...!
？！

[charaFace D 7]
＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
After all...who do you think placed these[sr]corridors and staircases to begin with?
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
It is only thanks to these staircases that you are able to make your way further and further inside.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
The way down could have been a pitfall, or a line of spears, but instead, you need merely contend with stairs.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
Why? Because that is what Lady Kama decided. There is no greater significance, nor does there need to be.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
This is no different.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
Lady Kama decided all these paths ahead of time,[sr]and there is no way you can go against them.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
Once you decided to delve into the Ooku, Lady Kama already had you exactly where she wanted. All you can do now is resign yourselves to your fate...
