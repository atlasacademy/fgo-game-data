Hi there, Master.[sr]What's up?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Were you just hanging out with those two?
？！

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V020]
Uh-huh.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V030]
I tend to space out in my spirit form whenever I'm not taking part in battles...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V040]
...and those two sometimes stop by to check on me.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V050]
I don't want to worry them, so I've started using my physical body more frequently.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V060]
I also met those ninja people and pirate people you once told me about.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：What'd you think of the ninjas?

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V070]
Good question...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V080]
I had an idea of how terrifying an Assassin's Presence Concealment could be...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V090]
...but ninjas are even more frightening,[sr]albeit in a different way.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V100]
It's almost like, even when I'm looking right at them, I still can't see them...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V110]
Like they might disappear if I let my guard down for an instant.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V120]
I asked that Katou ninja about it, and she said that the Fuuma clan is the greatest ninja clan in Japan.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V130]
It's very reassuring to know people like that are part of our group of Servants.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：How did you find the pirates?

[charaFace A 4]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V140]
They... Well, they're kind of hard to describe...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V150]
All I can say for sure is...that one called Blackbeard...uh...scares me.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V160]
I felt like he would pull out his flintlock and shoot me if I let my guard down even for a split-second.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V170]
...That happened to me once before, albeit by someone else. Luckily, my heart was tough enough that I survived.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V180]
Incidentally, right before that happened, I could feel the hairs on my neck standing on end.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V190]
If you ever experience the same feeling,[sr]Master, watch out.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？！

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V200]
Let's see...[sr]Oh, yes, I also ran into that jester Servant.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V210]
I didn't know he was a homunculus...just like me.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V220]
Or at least, that's how it seemed when we shook hands.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Sieg
[tVoice ValVoice_503800 0_V230]
I had no idea there were homunculi like that out there... It's been one surprise after another.[wait tVoice]
