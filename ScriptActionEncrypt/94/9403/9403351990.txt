Anyway, I asked the female Servants about valentines, and it sounds like you're supposed to give something in return.[wait tVoice]

I'm sorry, Master, but these dumplings would not be suitable as a return gift.[wait tVoice]

These are Fuuma Dumplings; a jewel of a food item that the whole Fuuma clan worked hard to create.[wait tVoice]

Each one contains an entire day's worth of vital nutrients, and is rich in protein, vitamins, and calories.[wait tVoice]

As long as you eat these dumplings, you'll never go hungry, or have to worry about nutritional deficiencies.[wait tVoice]
