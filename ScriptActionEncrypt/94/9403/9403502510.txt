...I am left with the impression that you very much want us to make our way through this Ooku.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Taken together...
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
...it seems quite clear your intention is that we make it through the Ooku by breaking all five precepts.

Though I still don't know what the significance of having us do so might be.

It's so stupidly simple it should[sr]have been obvious ages ago.

This is the Ooku, the shogun's personal harem. All I want is to make sure you all have the time of your lives.

The reason I designed it around the five precepts[sr]is because it's easier to understand.

The more you're forbidden from doing something,[sr]the better it feels when you do it.

In fact, while we're on the subject...you really don't need to limit yourselves to just the five precepts.
