I thought I should get you a present, since you always help me out so much...so I made you flapjacks.[wait tVoice]

The nice man who's always in the kitchen did help me a little, but I mostly made them by myself![wait tVoice]

They didn't fit in your room, so I left them out here for now... Wh-what do you think?[wait tVoice]

Teehee... That's 'cause I started by making my own special griddle.[wait tVoice]

＠Bunyan
[tVoice ValVoice_702800 0_V070]
I made sure to make them in the old-fashioned way, just like in my tall tale.[wait tVoice]

The kitchen guy wrapped bacon around his shoes and skated around the griddle to grease it for me.[wait tVoice]

He even did a beautiful quintuple half axel. Hehehe![wait tVoice]

But after that, I mixed them and cooked them all by myself![wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_702800 0_V130]
...And you'd better hurry. There's a really bad traffic jam building up behind them.[wait tVoice]
