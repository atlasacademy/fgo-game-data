＠Antonio
What are you doing here, detective?
[k]

＠Isidoro
Looking for something, just like you.
[k]

＠Isidoro
There's a certain high-ranking government official who's also a patron of the arts, you see, and he's been dying to get his hands on the court musicians' handwritten sheet music.
[k]

＠Isidoro
Despite my looks, I actually specialize in rock 'n' roll, so I had no way of knowing which was the sheet music I was asked to find.
[k]

＠Isidoro
So I decided to simply wait for you to find it for me.
[k]

I just wanted someone to collapse so I would[sr]have an excuse to move about the mansion freely.
[k]

＠Isidoro
So when Salazar brought us our wine glasses,[sr]I added poison to one of them when I took mine.

[charaFace B 1]

Salazar happened to find me while[sr]I was ransacking the storehouse...
[k]

＠Isidoro
...so I had no choice but to dispose of him.
[k]

＠Isidoro
Soon after, Vargas came by looking for Salazar...so I likewise had to dispose of him.

I was fortunate that he turned his back on me.

But...
[k]

＠Antonio
We still have some time before that happens.[sr]There's something I need to tell you.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Antonio
The revolution happened two days after I was kicked out of the palace. I was...delighted by my good fortune in that respect.
[k]

＠Antonio
All at once, everyone who had mocked my ability was dead. My revenge had been carried out by fate itself.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Antonio
At the time, I thought that the last one standing was the winner, regardless of the circumstances.
[k]

＠Antonio
I vowed to make the most of my new lease on life and go down as one of this nation's most popular musicians.
[k]

＠Antonio
Now, ten years later, no one can deny my success.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Antonio
But...no matter how much the masses praised my music, it never filled the hole in my heart.
[k]

＠Antonio
If anything, the more songs I wrote, the louder I could hear the other palace musicians sneering at me.
[k]

＠Elise
...Look, Uncle, I've always been too embarrassed to tell you this, but I love your songs! They're wonderful!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Antonio
Of course they are. That's because[sr]I was copying my favorite works.
[k]

＠Elise
Copying? What do you mean?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Antonio
The music played at the palace was always too dull and difficult for the masses to enjoy it.
[k]

＠Antonio
So I used their compositions as the base for songs that were easier to listen to... I wasn't writing my own music, I was translating theirs.
[k]

＠Antonio
I'm sure they would have laughed at me if they had still been alive. Even I can only hear a crude imitation of their work whenever I listen to one of my compositions.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Antonio
But that's all right. No matter how much I despised them, I loved their music more than anyone.
