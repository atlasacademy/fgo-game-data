＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
She was also an extremely talented martial artist,[sr]as befitting her Inaba and Saitou heritage.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
I myself was inspired to create a few new Yagyu techniques after merely happening to see her spar with Lord Iemitsu a few times.

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
She is a truly remarkable woman.

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
