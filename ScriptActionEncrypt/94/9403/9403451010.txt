＠H. C. A.
...Good, you finally made it to the bottom.[sr]Now, before you go on, let me tell you a little story.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
This story took place on the Far Side of the Moon,[sr]a world entirely different from yours.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
Back when BB was modifying herself over and over to help her corrode the Mooncell, she ended up creating five clones.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
These clones were High Servants, made by fusing the growing emotions she could no longer control with the essences of various goddesses.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
These Alter Egos came to be known[sr]collectively as the Sakura Five.

Meltryllis, the Alter Ego of pleasure.[sr][charaPut D 380,0][charaFadeTime D 0.7 0.5][charaMove D 400,0 1.0]Passionlip, the Alter Ego of love and hatred.

＠H. C. A.
And Kingprotea, the Alter Ego of yearning,[sr]is the one being compressed right over there.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
She's a sentient life-form who will grow and expand to infinity if left unchecked, and can only exist digitally.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
Left to her own devices, this walking disaster would consume SE.RA.PH and the Mooncell, eventually contaminating the ocean of stars.
[k]

？1：...Kingprotea...

[charaFace A 0]
＠H. C. A.
Right. Don't let her current six-sided appearance deceive you.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
This entire gravitational field is being generated[sr]by Protea herself. If that cube opens up[line 2]
[k]

？2：She doesn't look all that dangerous...

[charaFace A 2]
＠H. C. A.
That's only because she's been reset to level one.[sr]She's practically a newborn right now.
[k]

＠H. C. A.
And even then, just look at all these gravitational fluctuations she's causing. If she were ever to get out into the physical world[line 2]
[k]

＠H. C. A.
Here she comes! She grows bigger with every passing second, so you can't let this fight drag on!
[k]

＠H. C. A.
Blast her with everything you've got right away! If you can hit her faster than she can grow, you'll win!
[k]

＠H. C. A.
Another option, though I don't recommend it, is to hold out for as long as possible! Even a monster like her has limits!
[k]

＠H. C. A.
There should be a moment of vulnerability when she's transitioning to her next growth phase that you can take advantage of!
