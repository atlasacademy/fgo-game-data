It looks like a hanafuda card. I don't really know anything about them myself, though.

？1：It's a peony.
？2：It's a butterfly.

Is that anything like karuta?[sr]I've seen the Ooku's residents and attendants playing that before.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
It's no surprise that they might[sr]have dropped one of their cards.

Is there something strange about the card?

No, it is just an ordinary card. It has nothing to do with the expedition. But, its parameters are also not stable. They are constantly shifting around.
[k]

＠Sion
It is as if there is some sort of black box component to this card that makes it impossible to analyze...

I mean it is behaving the same as everything over your heads and beneath your feet: the very Ooku labyrinth you are currently traversing.
[k]

＠Sion
Obviously, the fact that it is giving off the same readings as the Ooku means that card is also part of the Ooku.
[k]

[charaFace G 15]
＠Sion
Unfortunately, I do not have any more[sr]information to go on at this moment.
[k]

＠Sion
Still, I do not think it poses any danger, and it is very intriguing that it would behave this way, so please hang on to it.
[k]

＠Sion
If you find any similar samples, then I should be able to conduct a more thorough analysis.
[k]

？1：Roger that.
？！

Hmm. Well, I can't complain too much as long as they're getting their work done, but it's still only right that they pick up after themselves when they're done!
[k]

[charaFace F 17]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I can understand if they didn't realize they dropped it, or they just forgot to pick it up...
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
...but once I find the culprit,[sr]they're still going to get an earful.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Oh yes, I'm happy to be the bad guy[sr]if it will keep the Ooku dignified.

All that aside, I'm a little surprised. I never would have pictured the Ooku's residents playing card games before.

Well of course they did. If they could never leave or have any fun, that would make it a prison, not a home.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
The women who lived in the Ooku were free to keep dogs, cats, and birds, sing songs, play the koto, have tea, hold hanami and tsukimi parties... There was plenty of entertainment to go around.
[k]

[charaFace F 11]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Of course, in this fake, gloomy, underground Ooku, there wouldn't be any way to hold a hanami or tsukimi party, would there...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
...Grr, now I am absolutely livid all over again!
[k]

[charaFace F 7]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Come on, everyone. The sooner we get to the bottom of this accursed fake Ooku and save the shogun, the better!
