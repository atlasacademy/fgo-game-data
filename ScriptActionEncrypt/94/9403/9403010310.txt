Does this mean... Is she the Medb from Chaldea?

Her readings don't look quite the same as usual...

In fact, the magical energy she's giving off right now seems very similar to Oniland's...

That's because you were on Main Street last time, where they could keep making new ones. They're much more manageable around attractions like this.
