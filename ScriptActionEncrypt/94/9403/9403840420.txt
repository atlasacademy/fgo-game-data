And our rear guard is running away! Though I guess that can't be helped, since it was in their contract!

[charaFace B 4]
＠Infantrywoman Nobbu
No punishment for running away, and payment in advance. The Chaldea clan must be the nicest daimyo in all the Warring States. Did you give them all dental, too?

Then again, this probably isn't the time to be discussing thaaat!
