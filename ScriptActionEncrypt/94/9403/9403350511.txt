Splitting your forces, huh. Not a bad idea. I don't know if they'll be able to recover any cursed books...

All that aside...

If all three Valkyries are capable of materializing at the same time, why don't they do so more often?

Oh, I think I can answer that one.
[k]

＠Mash
It's because having all three of them materialize at once uses an excessive amount of magical energy, thanks to their unique Spirit Origin Ascension pattern.
[k]

At least, that's what Da Vinci said.

There's a distinct possibility that it's hiding among the books that were lent out from the library...
