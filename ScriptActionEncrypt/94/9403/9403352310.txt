What is this about, Master? I see no news of battle, nor do I hear any sign of the evening bell.[wait tVoice]

There appears to be no situation that calls for this sword. I cannot say I approve of you imposing excessive labor on me in this manner.[wait tVoice]

Recuperation is another essential part of training. Perhaps you are still too young to understand that, but... Hm?[wait tVoice]

...You have a gift for this old man of the mountain?[wait tVoice]

？1：I sure do.
？2：The bell's still ringing, but it's more of a chapel bell.

No, nothing like that. This is so novel for me that you caught me off guard. ...Heh. I cannot believe I let someone strike me from my blind spot after all this time.[wait tVoice]

Given that you were able to take this assassin by surprise, I would be honored to accept this gift. I have no affinity for this event, but I do wish to help you save face.[wait tVoice]

However...that alone would bring shame to my clan. This may be but a trifle, but I would like you to accept this return gift nonetheless.[wait tVoice]

Student of magecraft, the battle for this planet's fate is unlikely to end anytime soon. I only hope that incense helps provide some solace.[wait tVoice]
