Ugh! What is your PROBLEM!?[sr]Being rude guests was bad enough...

You have no idea how hard I worked on this place,[sr]and all you've done is try to tear it down!

Oh, I don't mean like thumping an old-fashioned TV to fix it when it's acting up. Or shock therapy.
[k]

＠Sitonai
I'm talking about introducing a spell little by little whenever we come into contact in a fight.
[k]

＠Sitonai
Once the spell is ready, I'll activate it remotely, and it should repair her Spirit Origin, memory and all. At least that's the idea.
[k]

？1：That's so vague it might just work...

[charaFace C 6]

＠Sitonai
I'm just talking about fixing a magecraft-based being with magecraft, you know?
