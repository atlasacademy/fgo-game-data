Well, we managed to collect the scraps...but wow, what was the deal with that Heroine ZZ lady, anyway? I wasn't expecting to see so many of her...
[k]

？1：Sooo... Time to tell you about the Foreigner class...
？2：Okay, so...space cops are a thing...

？！

I have no idea what you're talking about,[sr]but I can tell it's not worth overthinking...

So many faces...identical to mine...[sr]I'm so sorry...

Heeheehee, Gray's always hated her own face! She'd probably faint on the spot if she ever visited Chaldea!

Honestly, it took me some getting used to... I was a bit dizzy at first. Still,[sr]you should be fine as long as you keep your hood on.

[charaFace C 1]

＠El-Melloi II
I've considered what it would be like having you at Chaldea more than a few times before, so I feel comfortable saying that.

Wait, back up.[sr]Is that sort of thing common in Chaldea!?

Hmm, these may not only be actual memories of yours. Some may be memories of possibilities, of things you could potentially have experienced.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
I suppose this means whoever is behind this can calculate events to such a fine degree that it becomes like a window into the future.

＠Reines
Then it really is anything goes in Chaldea. I can only imagine how the real Clock Tower would react if they knew the truth.
[k]

＠Reines
I'd bet good money that none of them would believe[sr]a word of it, no matter how official the report.
[k]

＠Reines
Then again, what if you wrote it yourself, brother? Imagine, an official report about Chaldea, written directly by a Lord of modern magecraft.
[k]

＠Reines
If you presented them with something like that, it wouldn't even matter whether they believed it or not anymore. It'd knock them all on their asses, even if they were sitting down.
[k]

＠Reines
I bet you'd even have all your classes joining in the uprising, assuming the world was stable enough.

＠Reines
Hehehe, imagine, a Clock Tower tens of years after my time there. Who knows? Flat or Svin might even make something of themselves by then.

This is no joke. Even a Pseudo-Servant should strive[sr]to have as few ties to the modern world as possible.

＠El-Melloi II
I'd be happy to offer advice as needed, but that sort of work should be handled by Chaldea staff and[sr][%1] [&himself:herself].

Just the kind of boring answer I'd expect from you, brother! Still, I guess it's a relief to see you haven't changed.

[charaFace A 8]

＠Reines
Hehe, you might not think it to look at him, pupil,[sr]but my brother's actually even harsher than I am.
