Oh, really? Well, no problem. I'll just have to come up with a ring name for you myself then, yes!

＠Quetzalcoatl
I will be using a ring name for myself as well!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Besides, this is the homeland of the faith that worshipped me, so better if I don't go around showing my face and using my True Name here. Instead...
