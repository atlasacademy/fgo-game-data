Yup. A little something to commemorate the fall of a certain wicked feudal lord. Said they crushed all the other silver coins that'd been in circulation around there to make 'em.[wait tVoice]

＠Robin Hood
[tVoice ValVoice_200300 0_V110]
Nothin' to do with me, of course, but some village girl I'd happened to meet insisted I take it.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Robin Hood
[tVoice ValVoice_200300 0_V120]
It might've been fleeting, but these coins were still made to celebrate a victory, so I figure they oughta at least be a good luck charm.[wait tVoice]

I wasn't being quiet. I was just preoccupied with something. Like I said, you kinda took me by surprise.[wait tVoice]

What say we head back to Chaldea? It's not a real celebration unless you're really living it up, after all.[wait tVoice]

＠Robin Hood
[tVoice ValVoice_200300 0_V180]
Then when you're done, you go back to your room and bask in the aftermath. That's the best way to enjoy these things, Master.[wait tVoice]
