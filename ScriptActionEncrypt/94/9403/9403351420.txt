Of course. I wouldn't feel right being the only one given a gift. Please, take it. It's the least I can do.[wait tVoice]

Neither Master nor we Servants would be able to fight without all your support.[wait tVoice]

Oh no, I just realized. Maybe I should have gotten a Valentine's card, too.[wait tVoice]

This would've been a perfect time to add a few words to my gift. Especially since it's for someone so special.[wait tVoice]

？1：Wait. Are you and one of the staff...

Haha, of course not! There's only one human who's really special to me, and I'm looking at [&him:her].[wait tVoice]

You gave me a chance to fight against my other self... The best possible chance I could ask for.[wait tVoice]
