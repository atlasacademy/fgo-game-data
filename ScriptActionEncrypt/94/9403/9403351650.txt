Perhaps our connection is deeper than I thought. You must have contracts with a great number of Servants by now...[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_602400 0_V050]
Of course I'm going to run into you while I'm in this Spirit Origin. It is the same one I had on that island where we spent that summer together.[wait tVoice]

I've been doing better than ever lately, perhaps thanks to all those runes I wrote on the island. I went to some considerable lengths for this gift.[wait tVoice]

Go on, accept it with gratitude.[wait tVoice]

And make sure to check the age restriction. If you are too young, I won't hesitate to confiscate it.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Scáthach
[tVoice ValVoice_602400 0_V120]
Still, even if the age restriction is not a problem... Hehe, you will need someone else to fully enjoy it.[wait tVoice]

＠Scáthach
[tVoice ValVoice_602400 0_V130]
If you can't find anyone, then enjoy it on your own.[sr]This is as far as I can be bothered to go.[wait tVoice]

That was close. Too close. If anyone besides me had had to face it, there's no telling what could have happened.[wait tVoice]
