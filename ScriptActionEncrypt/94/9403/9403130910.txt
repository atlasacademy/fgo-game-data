But either way, one thing I know for sure...is that they've been tremendously fulfilling for me.

＠Bradamante
Even with my pride and power stripped away, I've been on a new journey ever since you gave me that bread without seeking anything in return.

Thank you, [%1]. I can't tell you how grateful I am.
