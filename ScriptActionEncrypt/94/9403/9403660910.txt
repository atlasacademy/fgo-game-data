I've analyzed this paper a bit, and it would indeed seem to have the effects El-Melloi II has described.
[k]

？1：I knew you'd come through, Steam King!
？2：Never underestimate robot power!

？！

＠Babbage
A trifling analysis like this is hardly worthy of praise. At any rate, this does seem like it may lead us to the mastermind, but that will take more time.

In the meantime, I invite you[sr]to wait here in my castle.

Perhaps the paper [&he:she] almost ingested can provide[sr]a clue. Did the memories you saw at the time focus[sr]on any one person or thing in particular, [%1]?

If anything, you can much more easily justify hurting others if you believe you're doing so for the right reasons.

＠El-Melloi II
At any rate, I doubt it will be long before our enemy makes a move, so take this time to rest and recuperate.

？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Reines
I guess he manages to take care of himself in Chaldea then. Yeah, when my brother starts leaning on someone, he ends up relying on them for almost everything.

＠Reines
It's simple. He would never have had to “die”[sr]unless he was in an extremely tight spot.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Reines
Even if he did have a Spirit Origin to spare, separating the two is an incredibly difficult feat.
[k]

＠Reines
He could well and truly have died if things had gone wrong. The fact that he went through with it anyway just shows how dire the circumstances were.
[k]

＠Reines
So dire that his choices were between[sr]likely death and certain death.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Reines
Well, brother?

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Reines
Unlike other Servants, those who were summoned to resolve this have a clear and obvious connection.
[k]

＠Reines
Me... Gray... Luvia...[sr]All of us have deep ties to my brother.
[k]

＠Reines
But while Gray could reasonably qualify as a Servant,[sr]the same can't be said for Luvia or me.
[k]

＠Reines
So it must have been Zhuge Liang's[sr]Noble Phantasm that brought us here.
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk E]
[charaFace E 0]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]

＠El-Melloi II
Dispatch Troops, Zhuge Liang's other, EX-rank Noble Phantasm. It follows heroic legends to provide its targets with the abilities they need to succeed.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
In this case, it must have given you and Luvia Spirit Origins that could then be summoned to this Singularity.
[k]


＠El-Melloi II
Though, it wouldn't have worked this well if humanity weren't currently in such dire straits to begin with, or without this Singularity's particular circumstances.
[k]

？1：So that's why Reines and Luvia became Pseudo-Servants?
？2：Reines and Luvia being summoned here was because of Dispatch Troops?
？！

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Reines
So this was all Zhuge Liang's doing, huh.[sr]That explains how Sima Yi and I ended up together.
[k]

＠Reines
It's not because we have any connection of our own. It was because our current situation puts us in a state that is close to my brother's own situation.
[k]

＠Reines
That must have made it much easier to form the bonds needed for the magecraft to work. It all makes perfect sense once you understand that bit.

[charaTalk B]

[charaFadeout B 0.1]
[wt 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 0]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Reines
Right. I must have been forced into his position[sr]as a result of his Noble Phantasm pulling me in here.
[k]

＠Reines
It definitely all adds up neatly. The fact that it all made use of existing connections makes it easy to form a Mystic.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Reines
All that said, you got a lot of nerve dragging[sr]us over here just to clean up your mess, brother.

That's so like you, brother. You usually hate relying on anyone else for anything, but you have no trouble asking for help once things really go south.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Reines
Of course, I'll still take that over being a heartless fool who would refuse to do the same under similar circumstances.
