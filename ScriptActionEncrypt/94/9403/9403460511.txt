Convince the gangs that the relic is up for grabs now that you're dead, and that owning it will be their key to riches.
[k]

＠Moriarty
After that, all you need to do is take[sr]their thugs out whenever it's convenient.

But I didn't know he was a mage when I told him that...and as a result, the city quickly declined and ultimately faded away.

＠Moriarty
...Of course, as a criminal mastermind, my role[sr]in these events did not trouble my conscience.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Moriarty
But now that I'm your Servant,[sr]it's been eating away at me!
[k]

＠Moriarty
I swear, young [&man:lady], you have no idea how difficult[sr]it is to be an evil Servant in the service of such a very GOOD Master!

＠Moriarty
...At any rate, when I looked back on this[sr]outcome...I chalked it up to a careless mistake.
[k]

＠Moriarty
An awful turn of events,[sr]brought about by a few miscalculations.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Of course, even now that we've changed the past,[sr]this remains firmly in the realm of the hypothetical.
[k]

＠Moriarty
History remains the same, as does its outcome. What we partook in here was merely an illusion...purely for my own gratification.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Moriarty
I assure you, I'm well aware of that.
[k]

＠Moriarty
...Yet even so, I needed to be certain this[sr]error was affixed permanently in my memory.
[k]

＠Moriarty
I needed to remind myself that[sr]a bright future such as this...

＠Moriarty
...can come to a sudden,[sr]cruel end with but a single mistake.
[k]

＠Moriarty
...Even if I should parse the records upon waking up,[sr]that still won't change what really happened.
[k]

＠Moriarty
All I can do is cast my mind back and wonder uselessly about what might have been.
[k]

？1：I can think of something else you can do.
？！

＠Moriarty
Oh? And what's that?

Humanity is currently in the midst of an unprecedented crisis. One mistake on our part could lead to the extinction of the human race.
[k]

＠Moriarty
So next time...
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Moriarty
...you can be damned sure I won't[sr]miscarry so much as a single integer!

I can promise you that both as your Servant,[sr]and as your trusty partner!
