When I sensed a new resort and came to check it out,[sr]I never expected to be turned away at the door!

You don't want to put me up here? Fine! I wouldn't[sr]stay in your stupid violent hotel if you paid me!

＠Mysterious Visitor Dragon X
I hope you choke on a hot spring egg and die!

Good grief.[sr]I was afraid something like this might happen.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
I commend your effort, but this is what happens when you're indiscriminate about who you invite.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
Guests aren't supposed to be invited to the Enma-tei. They're supposed to find it themselves, after losing their way.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
That is the very essence of a mayoiga. Yet despite that, you knowingly invited that...hooligan here.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
I can only imagine how Madam[sr]Beni-Enma feels about all this.

Oh don't be daft, you big ape.[sr]Of course she'll be thrilled to have so many more guests!

Besides, if we hadn't stepped in to help, this place would still be wasting away to nothing!

Is that what you want!?

Of course not.[sr]I love the Enma-tei as much as anyone.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
But, unfortunately...its time has come and gone.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
The gods no longer care for Earth.[sr]Humans no longer hold the mountains in awe.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
It's only natural that the Enma-tei would also fade away. Much as it pains me to say, the times have left it behind.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
Chaldea, you said your home was called?[sr]I envy what you have.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
I never imagined there was still a place on Earth where humans and Heroic Spirits coexisted... Hohoho.

＠Goredolf
W-well, yes, it's true that Chaldea is a cutting-edge mythical place, so to speak, and as workshops go, it's considerably more modern than the Enma-tei...
[k]

＠Goredolf
But that still doesn't explain how[sr]this place got to such a sorry state.
[k]

[charaFace F 10]

＠Goredolf
I understand the Divine Spirits may have dwindled away as of late, but even so, it seems excessive.
[k]

＠Goredolf
It still has long-term guests such as yourself,[sr]and surely it still gets others from time to time.
[k]

＠Goredolf
Not to mention the offering box was[sr]full of gratitude when we arrived.
[k]

＠Goredolf
The Enma-tei may only be scraping by,[sr]but it's still exceptionally well-run.
[k]

＠Goredolf
So then, why has it declined to this degree?
[k]

＠Goredolf
Why have so many facilities been closed despite the staff's diligent maintenance?

＠Moneyed Monkey
Alas, it was a terrible debacle.[sr]I can't even bring myself to say it.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
Hoho, besides, I am but a humble, carefree guest.[sr]It is not my place to speak of the Enma-tei's failures.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
That goes for the other guests, too. Even the notoriously chatty Chief Snake knows better than to say anything.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
Still, you need not concern yourselves about it.[sr]There is nothing that can be done about this problem.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
All you need to worry about is filling the[sr]Tribute Hall with gratitude, and saving yourselves.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
You've already come this far, to the spirit world. No one could expect you to stick your necks out to solve someone else's problems.
[k]

＠Moneyed Monkey
The Enma-tei's problems are Madam[sr]Beni-Enma's to worry about, not yours.

Quite. The fact that she never mentioned this before simply means she didn't wish to speak of it.
[k]

＠Goredolf
No doubt trying to pry it out of her[sr]would only make her clam up more.
[k]

＠Goredolf
Our only choice is to coax the Enma-tei's story[sr]out of her as gently and naturally as possible.
[k]

＠Goredolf
Cursed Fionn mac Cumhaill. He must have already known it would come to this when he said we should start with work...
[k]

？1：For now, let's just focus on what we can do.
