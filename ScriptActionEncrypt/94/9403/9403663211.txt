Illyasviel von Einzbern...

？1：You know her?

？！

[charaFace C 0]

＠El-Melloi II
I'm aware of the name from relevant documentation about the event, not from meeting her personally.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
The Einzberns are one of the three magecraft families involved in the Fuyuki Holy Grail War.

My brother's been investigating Fuyuki's Holy Grail War for a long time now. This recreation was too close for comfort, really.

＠Reines
You know, you seemed to be lost in thought for a while there. Were you involved with Fuyuki back then or something?

...No, this is a different world. It may closely resemble the one I'm from, or even my vision of an ideal world, but it just isn't the same.

＠El-Melloi II
[charaFace C 1]Still, that's all the more reason why I'm[sr]glad I managed to get a glimpse of it here.

I expect you know what I'm talking about quite well,[sr]Master. Ah, I'm glad I got to see this.

Hmm. I suppose I would be lying[sr]if I said it was perfectly easy.

＠El-Melloi II
Don't be ridiculous. Of course I do.

？！

But regardless, it just goes to show that[sr]my actions can end up changing the world.
