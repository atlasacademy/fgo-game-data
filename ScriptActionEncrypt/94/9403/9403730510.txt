He collected some really amazing shit back when he was a general. It apparently would've easily kept him in power even if he'd had to retire.

＠Elise
...At least, that's the rumor I overheard at a dinner with some high-ranking government officials.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Elise
So if Gabriela inherited something that great, it's no wonder someone else'd want her out of the picture, right?

Cortés's legacy is no rumor.[sr]Trust me, I used to work under him.

[charaFace I 4]

＠Roma
I was a medical officer, so I had access to lots of different places. As a result, I was made to gather evidence of wrongdoing on all sorts of people.
[k]

[charaFace I 6]

＠Roma
And of course, the evidence I gathered[sr]was only a tiny fraction of the whole.
[k]

＠Roma
All told, I bet there were dozens of government officials who had collars slapped on them like that.
[k]

＠Roma
And it's not just skeevy blackmail material, either. I'd bet anything the legacy also includes priceless letters and works of art from the former kingdom.
[k]

And I'd also bet that it's all here[sr]somewhere in this enormous mansion.
