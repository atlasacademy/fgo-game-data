The Chaldea army has finished setting up camp in the crane formation.

＠Lowly Infantryman
The Real-Deal Nobunaga of Owari is headed this way with an army, just like the Mini Nobu Ninja Army's intel said.

Good. Then let's see what this so-called Real-Deal Nobunaga can do.

＠Infantrywoman Nobbu
Besides, I'm getting tired of being a lowly infantrywoman. Who knows? Maybe I'll just take over this province and strike out on my own!

I'm sorry, Nobunaga, but treason is the gravest crime you can commit against the Chaldea clan...even worse than stealing snacks.
