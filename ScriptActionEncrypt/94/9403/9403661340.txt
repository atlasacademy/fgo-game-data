Yes, because the fake Rhongomyniad has been destroyed, [bgm BGM_EVENT_78 0.1][sr]along with the Bounded Field that was preventing Chaldea from contacting you.
[k]

＠Astraea
Now, everything is being returned to where it belongs.[sr]There can be no better result of my judgment.

[charaFace D 1]

＠Astraea
[%1], as one who stands above all others,[sr]I am ashamed of how ignorant I have been.
[k]

＠Astraea
You may be a far cry from a distinguished hero, but it was that mediocrity of yours that ultimately saved the day.
[k]

＠Astraea
For it was your sheer, unremarkable ordinariness that let you empathize with Mnemosyne's plight, thus bringing this case to a close.
[k]

？1：Are you...trying to praise me? Is that what this is?
？2：That felt like all backhand and no praise.

？！

＠Astraea
Of course I'm praising you. I couldn't be happier that you were the Master that came to this Singularity.
[k]

＠Astraea
I'm proud that I was able to wield[sr]my sword and scales by your side.
[k]

＠Astraea
If our paths should ever cross again,[sr]I hope you'll remember that.

I'm okay with that. Maybe I'll end up there,[sr]maybe I won't, but at this point, I'm good either way.

Whether it's a new version of me that shows up there or not, you're gonna be my pupil for life.
