I felt as though something..[sr]or someone...was calling me.

＠
I am not just one thing now.
[k]

＠
All sorts of things are layered on top of each other to form me...though I also feel as though it has been that way for a very long time.
[k]

＠
I am a goddess. I am the wife of the supreme god, Maheśvara. I am a Servant. I am the avatar of mankind. I am called upon by humans. I am one who aids the effort to protect the world.
[k]

＠
And now, I am being called away..[sr]heading there as I speak.
[k]

＠
Though I'm sure I am being called away, I also know that I'm heading there of my own volition.
[k]

＠
I have to. I must.[sr]The impulses within my Divine Core demand it.
[k]

＠
I brush off the arm rudely trying to take hold of me, but I don't run away from it. Instead, I follow it to its source.
[k]

＠
I step out of a passageway made by humans,[sr]with human craftsmanship.
[k]

＠
I head towards a place that is not now.[sr]A time that is not here.
[k]

＠
I know something is waiting for me; something I can't ignore. And now, I arrive at a land of humanity, twisted beyond all recognition...

...I saw it the moment I arrived.
[k]

＠
The light of a soul, so faint it seemed[sr]as though it might go out at any moment.
[k]

＠
It was so small. So weak.[sr]But...it was still glowing.
[k]

＠
Even if it was fated to vanish in an instant,[sr]it was still there. I saw it.
[k]

＠
It looked to me like it was struggling desperately against something...like it was waiting for help.
[k]

＠
(...)
[k]

＠
I'm sure this isn't the reason I came here.
[k]

＠
It was only by coincidence that I happened to find this tiny remnant of a human soul.
[k]

＠
But, that's exactly why...I had to help it somehow.
[k]

＠
After all, if I came across a person in trouble,[sr]I wouldn't need a reason to help them.
[k]

＠
Every decent person would hope to do the same[sr](even if they rarely do in practice)...
[k]

＠
So as a kind and loving goddess, how could I refuse...

Usually, we would try to set the Rayshift coordinates to give you some time to take stock of your surroundings, but we simply didn't have the time.

So instead, we went with a location as[sr]close as possible to the target reading.

As a result, it looks like you've ended up inside Edo Castle[line 2]the heart of Edo's governing authority.
