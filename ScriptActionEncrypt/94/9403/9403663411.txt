？1：Why are you trying to wipe out humans!?


？2：Why are you just going along with whatever Tiamat says!?


？！

＠Benkei
I have told you my reason, and it has not changed.
[k]

＠Benkei
If I must give a new one now, it is because I find the Laḫmu beautiful. I greatly admire their way of life.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Benkei
As a colony, they have no need for great feats,[sr]and no need for miracles.
[k]

＠Benkei
Since they all act solely for their own benefit, there is no need for one to work selflessly to help those who are hurt.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Benkei
None are selfless, and therefore none permit themselves to have the life sucked from them by others. None suffer through humiliation, nor are they taken advantage of!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Benkei
What could be more beautiful than that? And so[sr]I shall pray for your death. For all your deaths.
[k]

＠Benkei
Let us all die together, so that we may begin anew. I shall accompany you, along with my numberless other selves...

Anyone else is a different story. My brother certainly has no need to take responsibility for my failings.
