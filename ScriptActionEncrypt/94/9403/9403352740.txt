It's a day for giving presents. I think they said it was some sort of Western custom?[wait tVoice]

Oh yes, I think it's a wonderful custom. Which is why...[wait tVoice]

And since I'm wearing a Western outfit myself now, I thought it would be nice for my gift to be a Western-style sweet as well.[wait tVoice]

Lord Emiya, Lady Boudica, and Lady Cat were all very kind in showing me how to make it.[wait tVoice]

That tart is an expression of my thoughts and feelings for you as a shadow prefect. Please do savor it.[wait tVoice]

Surely this goes without saying, but if you insist, very well! Today is a day to offer up our feelings to one another...[wait tVoice]

But that does not mean it is okay to prepare a gift, say, shaped like a heart. That would be unacceptable![wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
[tVoice ValVoice_302900 0_V160]
Such gifts would lead directly to indecent thoughts and acts, would they not? Yes, they would. And we can't have that.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
[tVoice ValVoice_302900 0_V170]
So as shadow prefects, we must keep our eyes peeled for any such shenanigans![wait tVoice]

？1：That's not what you said earlier.
？2：I thought today was a no “Unacceptable!” day?

？！
