My beloved daughter, Gabriela. By the time you read this, I'm afraid I will no longer be with you.

I have instructed Salazar to give you this letter when the time is right. Perhaps you'll read this three years from now... Ten years from now... Or maybe you never will.

There is every possibility that some disgruntled dissidents could try to attack the Meihousou when all this goes public.

So I think I'll stay here a little longer, to make sure Gabriela remains safe from any potential hooligans.

I was worried what might happen to this country after all those government officials were arrested for corruption...

...but luckily, it ended up just clearing the air.[sr]Thanks to that, it's a lot easier to do business now.

My family used to have to pay through the nose just to keep those guys off our backs. I'm glad they're in prison now.

＠???
What was that!?
[k]

＠???
Easy man, calm down. What're you talkin' about, pal?

＠???
There's a salon in a huge mansion called the Meihousou somewhere in the country that's run by a beautiful proprietress.
[k]

＠???
They say if you can prove yourself there,[sr]they'll invest in your career.
[k]

＠???
And if you do really good...Jobim might even give you one of his songs.

So it's my dream to become a good enough musician[sr]to be invited to the Meihousou some day.

Ah, just forget about it.[sr]There's no way that place really exists.
