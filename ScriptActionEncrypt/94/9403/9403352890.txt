Surprised? You shouldn't be. Even Valentine's can't always stand up to Christmas.[wait tVoice]

This still unwarmly dressed Santa thinks there's nothing wrong with having a fantasy like that.[wait tVoice]

？1：That voice...

I was unbelievably busy on the 24th. I had to visit every small town in the entire world in one day, after all.[wait tVoice]

Some people weren't home, some gifts had the wrong address, some children cried that it wasn't what they wanted, and sometimes I even bumped my head on my own candy cane...[wait tVoice]

I came here today to give you a gift. Not as Santa, but as me. Personally.[wait tVoice]

I actually secretly stashed this away on Christmas Day... I hope you like it.[wait tVoice]

H-huh. Handing it to you in person like this really makes my face feel warm.[wait tVoice]

I guess I learned something new today. But this is very nerve-wracking, so I don't think I'll do this again.[wait tVoice]

I heard that for young [&men:ladies], getting to eat a whole cake by themselves is the height of luxury.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_202200 0_V170]
So I'd like you to go ahead and stuff your cheeks with a big smile. It should ensure you have sweet dreams.[wait tVoice]

Now, I'd better get going. Altera Santa can only stay on Earth for three turns, after all.[wait tVoice]

You're very smart, aren't you. And very kind, too.[sr]...Okay. I guess I can have some then.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_202200 0_V210]
Hehe. I'm sure it's delicious. In fact, I guarantee it. I made sure to choose this one very carefully, after all.[wait tVoice]

＠Altera Santa
[tVoice ValVoice_202200 0_V220]
Just make sure you don't eat so much you end up with a bloody nose. Yes, that can happen. Trust me.[wait tVoice]
