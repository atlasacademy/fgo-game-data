I thought I had grown accustomed to such things, yet they still manage to surprise.[wait tVoice]

This “sim-you-lay-tor” device is truly fascinating. To think that this illusion is, in its own way, just as real as you or I.[wait tVoice]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
[tVoice ValVoice_103200 0_V070]
And yet, its scents are still somewhat lacking. I sense no life whatsoever in the scents of this wind, this grass, these trees, and especially this earth.[wait tVoice]

To think that I would be given to such bouts of giddiness at my age. It has been some time since I first manifested in this shadow form...[wait tVoice]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami

It is the bridge that lies at the foot of Reigenzaka; the hill that leads to the Yagyu family's Houtokuzen Temple, originally built by the monk Takuan.[wait tVoice]

Now I am glad indeed that I asked Lady Da Vinci and Lord Holmes to devote so many of the sim-you-lay-tor's resources to its depiction.[wait tVoice]

？！

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
[tVoice ValVoice_103200 0_V190]
This is one of my favorite places. It shines brightest in the evenings, and even more so when surrounded by autumn foliage.[wait tVoice]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
[tVoice ValVoice_103200 0_V200]
This one is, of course, a fake. An imitation crafted solely by the sim-you-lay-tor. [tdelay 1 5.5 1][charaFace A 0][delay -]And yet...[wait tVoice]

Now that I am but a shadow of my former self, who is to say that this imitation is not the true Momiji Bridge as far as I am concerned?[wait tVoice]
