Damn Salazar... I ordered him to kill the prince,[sr]not to accidentally poison Gabriela.
[k]

＠B：???
To make matters worse,[sr]the fool went and got himself killed...
[k]

＠B：???
Still, at least he was able to finish off the prince before he died. I might even still be able to revive Gabriela.
[k]

＠B：???
But in the meantime, what am I going to do...?

＠García
This manor used to belong to the royal family. Vargas and I played hide and seek here when we were kids more times than I can count.
[k]

＠García
No matter how much you renovate the Meihousou,[sr]you can't change its fundamental layout.
[k]

＠Miguel
Hmm... You're brave, strong, and sharp.[sr]Just the sort of man I'd hoped you were.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠García
What are you talking about?
[k]

＠Miguel
I'm offering you a job.
[k]

＠Miguel
How would you like to stay at the Meihousou,[sr]and carry on in Salazar's stead?
[k]

＠García
Are you serious?

＠Miguel
I faked my death so I could retire from the world's stage and run this country from behind the scenes like a ghost.
[k]

＠Miguel
But there's only so much a ghost can do on his own. I still need living people, like Gabriela and Salazar, to enact my will.
[k]

＠Miguel
And now that Salazar is dead, well,[sr]you can imagine my predicament.
[k]

＠Miguel
What do you say?[sr]Come work for me, and you will want for nothing.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Miguel
Furthermore, the day I truly die is not far off. When I go, all this will be yours. Not a bad deal, don't you think?

I refuse.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Miguel
Oh? So you're here merely to seek revenge, like a fool?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠García
That sounds like a confession to me.
[k]

＠Miguel
I admit, I did order Salazar to kill the prince, but now that he's gone, you have no one left to pledge your loyalty to, correct?
[k]

＠Miguel
I'm prepared to pay you handsomely to compensate for the loss of your master. You can even have Gabrie[line 2]

Even so...this only means you have all the more reason to team up with me.

＠Miguel
If you play your cards right with my legacy, you might even be able to reinstate the royal family.

I haven't even told Gabriela about the truly valuable parts of my legacy.

But if you kill me now, all of it will be lost forev[line 2]

I just thought I would leave a bit early.[sr]I still gotta bury Vargas, after all.

＠Roma
Well, you'll be glad to know that Gabriela regained consciousness a short while ago. She's sleeping again right now, but she should be all better soon.

＠García
I see... I am glad to hear that.

＠García
Please give her my best once she wakes up.

By the way, my nose might not be as sharp as yours, but it isn't bad. It's especially sensitive to the smell of blood.

Trust me, you're better off not knowing. Don't worry, I'll take full responsibility for any trouble that ensues.

You know, now that Salazar is gone, it's going to be real lonely for Gabriela here.

Would you mind staying here and keeping her company?

Keep Gabriela safe, hunt just enough to get by...[sr]Huh, that does sound nice.

[charaFace D 0]

＠Roma
So, you'll do it?

＠García
I can't. There's still something I need to do.[sr]It's why Vargas and I traveled the world.

[charaFace D 10]

＠Roma
I've heard on the radio at my clinic about some mysterious heroes going around helping people. I can't believe it was you guys.
[k]

＠García
Helping people is the last prince of Nadai Nadha's job. The country's government might have changed, but the prince's duty remains.

That's awfully noble of you, Maybe things would've turned out differently if you had been king.
