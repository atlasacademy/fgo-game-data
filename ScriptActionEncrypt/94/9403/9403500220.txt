＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
This is the Osuzurouka, the Bell Corridor. It's the only way to get from the Nakaoku, where the shogun resides, to the Ooku.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
The Ooku itself has several other entrances...
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
...so this corridor is usually reserved[sr]solely for the shogun's use.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
But since it looks like this is the only way into the new labyrinthine Ooku, I'm afraid we have no choice but to make use of it ourselves.

＠Sion
If you were to enter the Ooku from one of the servant entrances[line 2]or even if you were to get a bird's eye view of the place...
[k]

＠Sion
...I am sure it would look like[sr]a perfectly ordinary building.
[k]

＠Sion
But, when you go there from the passage reserved just for the shogun, it leads to a mysterious labyrinth.
[k]

＠Sion
That appears to be the situation[sr]we are dealing with right now.
[k]

＠Sion
...That space is clearly warped. It is an unknown and secluded spatial structure made by magecraft.
[k]

[charaFace D 11]

＠Sion
To be honest, it may even surpass the Atlas Institute's engineering. Though I really should not compare them, since this technology and ours could not possibly be more different.
[k]

[charaFace D 15]

＠Sion
Whatever is happening here is like nothing I have ever seen... How strange... This sort of thing would usually be right up my alley.
[k]

＠Sion
But for some reason, I just cannot[sr]get excited about this at all.

Indeed. I have no idea how or why this happened.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I'm also pretty sure we never had[sr]this much Indian decor before.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Ugh, this is all wrong for Tokugawa interior design! If the decorator were here, I'd ask them to redo the whole thing!

Just look at them! I would never, ever hire anyone like that! The Ooku's attendants must be proper ladies from noble families!

They may look alluring, but they are nothing more than automata or homunculi... Puppets, really.

The Ojouguchi does need someone to stand guard at all hours of the day and night, so maybe our enemy thought that marionettes who don't need to sleep would be right for the job.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
What a ridiculous idea.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
At any rate, that is definitely the door to the Ooku, so we can't afford to stop now.
