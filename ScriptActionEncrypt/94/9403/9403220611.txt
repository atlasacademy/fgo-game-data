Only a surprise, huh. You're really[sr]taking this in stride, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1]!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Beni-Enma
Still, I'm glad to hear you say that, chirp chirp.[sr]It warms my heart to see humans be so forgiving.
[k]

？2：Um... I'm guessing there's something of a story with him?

＠Beni-Enma
Yes, there is... Mr. Tiger is technically a monster, rather than the Divided Spirit of a god.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
He ended up here after he lost his home and had nowhere else to go, just like Chief Snake and Moneyed Monkey.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I know all too well what that's like, so I can't help but want to look after them, chirp.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

？！

＠Beni-Enma
Anyway, I'm grateful you came to help.[sr]If you hadn't, I might have ended up taking his life.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
You do have to be considerably stronger than your opponent to subdue them without killing them.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
At first, I didn't understand you could keep Tamamo, Kiyohime, and Tomoe in line despite being human.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
But now, I can see why they all enjoy serving you.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Beni-Enma
In fact, since you're such a good person, I think Lord Enma will be forgiving about what happened in the Tribute Hall, cheep!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Beni-Enma
So try not to push yourself too hard. It's okay to take your time to build up gratitude. And don't forget to rest every now and then, all right?
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
The Enma-tei doesn't often get married couples, chirp, so make sure to spend some quality time with Mash, too.

There she goes, back to work. I-it's cute how she has the wrong idea about us, isn't it?

[charaFace E 13]

Okay, then let's go to the kitchen.[sr]I think Tamamo said she was going to make dumplings.
