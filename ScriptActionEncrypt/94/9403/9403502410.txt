＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I'm impressed by how many stories[sr]you know, Lady Scheherazade.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
And the expert way you tell them would easily give Lord Hideyoshi's famous storyteller a run for his money!
[k]

＠Scheherazade
I could say I only learned how to tell stories well because it was essential for my survival...but the truth is simply that I've always loved them.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I see. I used to tell Lord Iemitsu...or rather, Lord Takechiyo, as he was known back then, a number of stories myself.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Momotarou, Issun Boushi, Urashima Tarou... Stories are an essential part of any child's moral upbringing.
[k]

[charaFace A 16]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
...Wait. Th-those people aren't among[sr]your companions too, are they...!?
[k]

？1：Not so far.

[charaFace B 3]

？2：We do have a westernized Kintarou and Shuten-Douji, but that's about it...

[charaFace A 8]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
W-Westernized? Sakata Kintoki, one of the Four Heavenly Kings, is westernized? What in the world happened to him!?

＠Scheherazade
I would love to know more Japanese folk tales. I may have mentioned this earlier, but I was actually studying them when all this happened.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
There are a great many stories from the Tokugawa era.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
In addition to Abaren-Boy Yoshimune...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
...some of the more famous ones include Mito of Chirimen and Echizen the Ruler.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Of course, I also know stories[sr]about you, Kasuga-no-Tsubone.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Y-you do? Really?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Oh gosh, I'm not sure what to say to that. Part of me would love to hear them, and another part would rather do anything but...
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I'm not a fearsome general, or even an ordinary warrior. I'm just the shogun family's wet nurse.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Oh, I just had a thought. If there are even stories of me, there must be dozens upon dozens of stories about the legendary Lord Yagyu Munenori.

...I am told that the Edo Yagyu have[sr]been gone for hundreds of years.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Mitsuyoshi appears to have far more fame in the modern world than I. Nowadays, the name "Yagyu" is synonymous with the one-eyed Yagyu Jubei.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Truly a delightful turn of events, is it not?

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Ugh, this is what I hate about dealing with you enlightened swordsman types. I can't tell what you're thinking!
[k]

[charaFace A 17]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I know that implicit communication was important even in the Ooku, so I get why it would be even more important in politics, but still.

However, I'm quite certain that Kama designed this floor to be easier to navigate the more one steals.

That being the case, our best bet may be places that afford easy opportunities to steal, or where stealing might have many obvious benefits.

[charaFace B 6]

...I first began telling tales in a closed-off world[sr]of night not unlike this very Ooku labyrinth.

＠Scheherazade
From the beginning, my stories have always been meant to find a way out of seemingly hopeless predicaments...
