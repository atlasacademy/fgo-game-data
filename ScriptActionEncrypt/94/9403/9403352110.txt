You fool! You've grown quite full of yourself if you think you can casually call me over for a non-emergency, mongrel![wait tVoice]

Besides, your lowly commoner attempt at confectionaries could never hope to satisfy my palate.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
[tVoice ValVoice_200200 0_V040]
Need I remind you that I am the ultimate king of luxury, with extremely refined tastes. That paltry excuse for confectionary may be fine for children, but it is absolutely not for me.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：But you haven't even tried it...
？2：But I used a gourmet recipe and everything...

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gilgamesh
[tVoice ValVoice_200200 0_V050]
Ha! You've let your true colors show, mongrel. A true delicacy's worth is only twenty percent based on flavor. Appearance counts for the other eighty percent![wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
[tVoice ValVoice_200200 0_V060]
One look at that appallingly dull wrapping tells me all I need to know about its taste. A true confectionary treat would be chocolate wrapped in a gold foil package and sprinkled with edible gold...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
[tVoice ValVoice_200200 0_V070]
Only such a dazzlingly brilliant treat as that is worthy of being tasted by my tongue![wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

[tVoice ValVoice_200200 0_V080]
...Of course, there is a limit to how much edible gold one should consume. Otherwise, you end up like King Midas...[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_200200 0_V090]
At any rate, I have no interest in that slop whatsoever! That said, I am also not one to refuse tribute from one of my loyal vassals.[wait tVoice]

？1：Ah!

Hmph. For the moment, I will accept your paltry offering. I won't even remember it a few minutes from now, anyway![wait tVoice]

I commend you for bringing me tribute, but it seems you cannot escape your third-rate mongrel nature. To offer candy to a king is to offer fruit to the heavens.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
[tVoice ValVoice_200200 0_V120]
An offering that is merely passable is no better than an insult. However, I will overlook your transgression just this once. Consider it a consolation prize.[wait tVoice]

Let's see... Well, well, you actually did make it by hand. A good first step.[wait tVoice]

＠Gilgamesh
[tVoice ValVoice_200200 0_V140]
Oho, and what's this? You modeled it after the door to my treasury, did you?[wait tVoice]

＠Gilgamesh
[tVoice ValVoice_200200 0_V150]
Fuhaha, is this your way of making up for your third-rate ingredients, mongrel!? You should be ashamed of yourself![wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
[tVoice ValVoice_200200 0_V160]
However, the crucial matter is taste. One cannot fill one's belly on good intentions alone, after all. Well, I suppose I can try a bite out of idle curiosity...[wait tVoice]

Personally, I think it would've been better for him to give this to you himself, but what do I know? I may be many things, but a king isn't one of them.[wait tVoice]
