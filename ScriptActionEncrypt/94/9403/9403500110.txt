Here you go, Senpai. I decided to try herbal tea today. What do you think?
[k]

？1：It smells great.
？2：It's very soothing.
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
I was so happy when I found out that Sion had brought along these sorts of luxury goods.

Yes, of course! Having nothing but bland supplements would ruin the camp-like atmosphere!

＠Sion
I am fine with only the bare minimum of resources necessary to survive, myself, but I cannot speak for anyone else.
[k]

[charaFace C 9]

＠Sion
So I made sure you would have a wide variety of food and recreation to choose from, thus satisfying your need for both mental and physical nourishment.
[k]

＠Sion
I already spent all of the Atlas Spiritron Points I had been saving for years to acquire them, so you may as well make the most of them!

Hehe. You know, having proper[sr]tea together like this again...
[k]

＠Mash
...reminds me of the old Chaldea, in the Antarctic...
[k]

？1：...Me too.
？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
I know things are completely different now,[sr]so I shouldn't be feeling sorry for myself, but...
[k]

？1：They say it's important to rest up when you can.

？2：There's a saying for this sort of thing: “Haste makes waste.”

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Yes, I've heard that one before. There are similar sayings in other languages as well.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
It's amazing to think that similar sayings would be formed in completely different civilizations and cultures.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
Anyway, putting all that aside...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
You're right. At this point, all we can do is wait for Sion and Captain to finish modifying the Shadow Border...
[k]

＠Mash
...so that it will be stable enough for[sr]us to head to the Atlantic Lostbelt.
[k]

＠Mash
As much as we'd like to help,[sr]it's all just way above our heads.
[k]

？1：I wonder how it's coming along.
？！

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
Good question. All we know for sure is that it's taking longer than anyone expected.
[k]

＠Mash
Sion said that Da Vinci's design for the Border is even more intricate and delicately balanced than she had thought...
[k]

＠Mash
I remember Da Vinci seemed both pleased and apologetic about that.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
At any rate, they also said that there's a crucial part they need for the modifications...
[k]

＠Mash
...and that we'll probably need to[sr]go to the Indian Lostbelt to get it.
[k]

？1：I wonder what that's all about?
？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
It could be something that can only be obtained there, or it could be for some other reason.
[k]

＠Mash
I'm sorry. I just don't know enough[sr]to say one way or the other...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
All I know is that, at this point, it sounds like they're putting the pieces together so they can install this necessary part.
[k]

＠Mash
Sion thought that this preliminary preparation would be finished soon after we got back from the Chinese Lostbelt...
[k]

＠Mash
...but apparently, things didn't quite go as planned.
[k]

＠Mash
Still, Captain did say it looks like they should[sr]be finishing this stage fairly soon now.
[k]

？1：Then let's recuperate until it's our turn to help.
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Agreed. We should rest up while we can[sr]so we can hit the ground running!
[k]

＠Mash
Would you like some more tea, Senpai?[sr]We also have plenty of cookies to go with it.

＠Mash
W-well, there's a reason for that!
[k]

＠Mash
Things have become much more lively around Chaldea Base now that we have more Servants here...
[k]

＠Mash
...so I made extra to share in case[sr]I ran into any of them on my way here.
[k]

＠Mash
But as luck would have it, I haven't seen anyone else today... Not even Fou.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_77 1.0]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
In fact, now that I think about it, it feels like Chaldea Base is way too quiet today...

If you are there, give me some sort of response! Even an empty message will do! Otherwise, this is the end for New Chaldea!

Great! Is Mash there with you too? Good, then we are still hanging in there by the skin of our teeth!

This is NOT the time to ghost me! We already have more than enough dead air in our budget!

Okay, I can hear you breathing, so that will suffice to confirm your existence for me. Are you there too, Mash? Even better!

What's going on, Sion!? Why is the alarm going off!?

[charaFace B 4]

＠B：Sion
In all of history, there has only ever been one reason for an alarm to go off at a base. New Chaldea is under attack.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]

＠Mash
Attack!?
[k]

[charaFace B 16]

＠B：Sion
Correct. It is rather terrible. Like waking only[sr]to find all your data from yesterday is corrupted.

[charaFace B 10]

What else can you do at a time like this but laugh!

Did you see anyone else on your way here?[sr]Anyone at all, like one of the staff, or a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
...No, I didn't. In fact, I was just telling Master how strange it was that I haven't seen anyone else today.
[k]

＠Mash
Does that have something to do with this attack?
[k]

[charaFace C 15]

＠Sion
This is what I was afraid of... I was hoping that at least one person might be hiding with Presence Concealment, but I guess that is not the case.
[k]

＠Sion
As soon as I realized there was no one else in the Command Room[line 2]no staff, no Holmes, no Da Vinci...
[k]

＠Sion
...I cut off your cause-and-effect[sr]interference to keep you both safe.
[k]

＠Sion
To think the only ones I could help in time were you two and myself, especially since I have already cut myself off from human history...

You can see what sort of attack[sr]we are under for yourselves.
[k]

＠Sion
Even after sounding the alarm and putting out a call,[sr]you two were the only ones to come here. [wt 0.9][bgmStop BGM_EVENT_81 0.7]And that can[sr]only mean one thing...
