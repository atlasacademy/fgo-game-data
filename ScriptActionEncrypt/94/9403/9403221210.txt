Oh, [%1]! Perfect timing![sr]You'll never believe this!
[k]

＠Sanzang
This amusement center is the absolute worst! First place was all mine going into fourth south hanchan...
[k]

＠Sanzang
...but at the very end the other three players all hit me with the last discard of the game! Triple rooon! Game over.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Sanzang
You're supposed to abort the round on a sanchahou, right? Not here, apparently! Dumb house rules...
[k]

＠Sanzang
And don't even get me started on that monkey mask[sr]guy trying to confuse me with all his chatter!

I'm sorry, Sanzang, but could[sr]you please try to calm down?

＠Mash
I can tell you're talking about some sort of game,[sr]but I'm afraid I can't tell what game it is...

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Ms. Monk, gambling is strictly prohibited here. Playing for fun is perfectly fine, so try to keep it that way, okay?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Unless you've come to enjoy losing, somehow? Or maybe for you monks, being taken for all you're worth makes you more worthy or something of the sort?

Is it just me, fox lady, or do you have some beyond crazy karma? I don't think you could atone for it all in two lifetimes, let alone one.

[charaFace C 1]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Oh, it's just you. I'm sure I simply happen to resemble whoever you may be thinking of. Mere coincidence, nothing more.

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_7 0.5]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
But never mind that. This may sound rather sudden,[sr]Ms. Monk, but we were wondering something...
[k]

？1：You don't happen to have one of the Buddha's stone begging bowls?

Wow, this is going better than I thought.[sr]You were all looking for this bowl?
[k]

＠Sanzang
Well, I sure don't need it anymore, so if you want to take it off my hands, that's more than fine with me!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Sanzang
Oh, then again, maybe it's not the best idea to sell this... It did originally belong to the Buddha...
[k]

？1：There must be some way to work this out.
？2：Please? You'd be doing us a huge favor.

I can understand why you'd be reluctant to sell something so valuable, but we have very strong reasons for needing it.

Come on, what do you say? I'm willing to accept any divine punishment that might come our way as a result.

I hope for your sake you have a Servant[sr]that can handle my Buddha Palm!
