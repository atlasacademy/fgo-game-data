Oh, if it isn't [%1]. To think that we would run into each other in the hallway on today of all days.[wait tVoice]

Are you on the prowl for Valentine's chocolate, too?[wait tVoice]

Wonderful! One can never have too many adventures when it comes to love![wait tVoice]

After all, it would be a bad look for me to be the only one going around hitting on ladies, right? But if everyone else is making a big to-do about nothing, then there's no problem at all.[wait tVoice]

If a leaf is best hidden in the forest, then a secret is best hidden in a party[line 2]Hm?[wait tVoice]

That thing you have in your hands...[sr]Is that actually for me? Really?[wait tVoice]

？1：Yes. I don't know what I was thinking.
？2：Yup. I must have been temporarily insane.

...I see. Unfortunately, sugar does absolutely nothing for me in terms of nutrition.[wait tVoice]

But the thoughts behind it are utterly delicious. We incubi feed on the energy from mental activity, after all.[wait tVoice]

Your thought process just now was especially sublime.[wait tVoice]

It had a soft, fluffy viscosity to it, and an almost overbearing texture that nonetheless leaves me wanting more.[wait tVoice]

Hmm. This must be what you call “sweet.” And in turn, what they mean when they say not to judge a book by its cover.[wait tVoice]

Yes, this is definitely worth giving you something in return. Or rather, makes me glad that I'd already gotten you something.[wait tVoice]

＠Merlin
[tVoice ValVoice_500800 0_V140]
I'd like you to have this. Just so you know, I made it myself, so it doesn't have much in the way of monetary value.[wait tVoice]

Not to be too heavy with the spoilers, but he and I have a lot in common. You might even say our origins are strikingly similar.[wait tVoice]

＠Merlin
[tVoice ValVoice_500800 0_V160]
That's why we look so much alike. I hope you'll think back on us both whenever you look at that.[wait tVoice]
