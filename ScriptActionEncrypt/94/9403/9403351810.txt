...Chocolate, huh. I see.[sr]So today's Valentine's Day.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠El-Melloi
[tVoice ValVoice_501900 0_V020]
In Japan, it's long been a de-facto rule that women give chocolate to men on this day.[wait tVoice]

＠El-Melloi
[tVoice ValVoice_501900 0_V030]
Of course, that appears to be changing as of late. As they say, nothing stays the same forever.[wait tVoice]

Hm? How do they celebrate Valentine's in England?[wait tVoice]

In England, gender doesn't come into it at all. There, you simply give chocolate to whomever you like.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠El-Melloi
[tVoice ValVoice_501900 0_V060]
In fact, it was England that originated the custom of giving chocolate on this day.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠El-Melloi
[tVoice ValVoice_501900 0_V070]
In addition to chocolate, people also typically gift things like wine, flowers, and champagne.[wait tVoice]

Most importantly, you're supposed to send your recipient a message on a card without signing it.[wait tVoice]

？1：So, people give gifts anonymously there?

[charaFace A 1]

＠El-Melloi
[tVoice ValVoice_501900 0_V090]
That's right.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠El-Melloi
[tVoice ValVoice_501900 0_V100]
And since the recipient doesn't know you've sent them anything, you can avoid handing your gift to them in person.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：What sort of message?

[charaFace A 1]

＠El-Melloi
[tVoice ValVoice_501900 0_V110]
Perfectly ordinary expressions of love.[sr]Things like “Please be my lover” and such.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠El-Melloi
[tVoice ValVoice_501900 0_V120]
Despite their boldness, or perhaps because of it, these messages are quite powerful, since they leave no room for misinterpretation.[wait tVoice]

...Of course, this style of gift-giving only works when employed by decent, ordinary people.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠El-Melloi
[tVoice ValVoice_501900 0_V140]
Using a gift from an anonymous mage would be madness. You may as well smoke a cigarette next to a puddle of gasoline.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠El-Melloi
[tVoice ValVoice_501900 0_V150]
If you ever get such a present yourself, just throw it away without a second thought.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠El-Melloi
[tVoice ValVoice_501900 0_V160]
Now then, I think I'll go ahead and enjoy this chocolate. It's an essential item for intensive mental work, after all.[wait tVoice]
