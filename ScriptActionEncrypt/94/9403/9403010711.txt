＠The Last Manager
You call yourself a “Magifender,” do you? Very well then, strange demon of the Far East. Since you have come to the aid of these rude guests, let us see how you defend against my wildfire-honed blade.
[k]

＠The Last Manager
For I am quite certain that you, or anyone for that matter, will be unable to defend against it at all!
