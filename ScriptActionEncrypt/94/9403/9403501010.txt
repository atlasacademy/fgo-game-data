What happened to you, Lord Nobutsuna? You were once one of the shogun's most trusted advisors.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
How could you turn your back on Tokugawa and lower yourself to aiding this madness? You should be ashamed.

(Cough)... I can understand why you would say that, Lord Munenori, given that you taught Shogun Iemitsu in the ways of war.

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
But that is all in the past now.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
Lady Kama is a god. She has already toppled the Tokugawa shogunate, and we have no hope of defeating her. It is natural that the loser swear allegiance to the victor.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
There are times when victory is simply not possible. That is a part of war. You fought in the battles of Sekigahara and Osaka, Lord Munenori. Surely you can understand.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
Of course, I too know well of what I speak. I witnessed the hell that was the Shimabara-Amakusa Rebellion myself.

Lord Munenori, I have nothing but the highest respect for your skill with the sword, and for your leadership.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
That is why I have gone out of my way to[sr]offer you a role in this new government.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
It is only through my request and Lady Kama's good graces that you still remain here.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
If she so wished, Lady Kama could use her spells to rob you of your mind and force you to be an attendant, as she has done with a number of other Servants.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
But I would much prefer you agreed[sr]to join us of your own volition.
[k]


[charaTalk B]
＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
There is nothing else to say. I will never wield my sword in service of Tokugawa's enemies.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
If this old body of mine impedes your way,[sr]then behead me and be done with it.

[charaFace G 0]
＠Sion
That person you see over there is undoubtedly Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami Munenori, a Saber with ties to Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Sion
But at the same time, he is also giving off the same readings as one of Ooku's pillars.
[k]

＠Sion
Oh yes, and it is not just him. If we assume the same is true for everyone else, everything adds up.
[k]

＠Sion
Where did the people in Edo Castle go?[sr]What happened to Chaldea's staff and Servants?
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_81 1.0]

So if I wish to stop you from stripping it of every panel, I had to tell you that doing so will not let you rescue everyone you seek.

[charaFace G 0]
＠Sion
There would be no point in bringing back these resources without their associated qualia.
[k]

＠Sion
But if we can analyze the spell this Ooku's construction rests on, then I should be able to reverse engineer it and restore everything to normal.
[k]

＠Sion
Alternatively, if we take the simpler route and remove the spell's caster[line 2]Kama, I presume[line 2]from the equation, that should result in the Ooku's destruction.
[k]

[charaFace G 14]
＠Sion
Either way, we still need to[sr]get down to the bottom floor.

He certainly does. Since he has not yet fully become part of the Ooku, there is still a chance he can be extracted.
