As I'm sure you all know, this leaf is a powerful catalyst that can be used to summon the great hero Siegfried.

Using this catalyst, your chances of[sr]summoning anyone else are negligible.
[k]

＠Sieg
It cannot be divided among you, however, as its effectiveness as a catalyst would be greatly compromised by the damage such division would cause.

So only one of you may claim this relic.

But no one need be hurt to do so.[sr]That is certainly not what I want.
