＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Allow me to explain! Jigoku Kitchen is the[sr]name of Ms. Beni-Enma's cooking class!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Everyone who attends it goes to hell, regardless of how long they've been married or how bad they are in the kitchen.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
It's a place that makes full use of the judge of hell's authority! It's the most devilishly difficult culinary boot camp ever...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
An entirely different layer of hell that will train any amateur cook into a full-blown chef☆
[k]

？1：Sounds like fun!
？2：So they'll be done in, say, a couple of hours tops?

[charaFace A 2]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
We're not talking about some[sr]community college workshop here!

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I can tell from your expression that you think they're just going to go over different cooking techniques...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...but Ms. Beni-Enma does NOT deal in theory!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
If you want to learn her best recipes, how to tell good tools from bad, what seasonings to use, and other useful tidbits...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...you'll need to brave the gauntlet and[sr]become a first-class tormentor demon first!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I must emphasize that Ms. Beni's teaching methods are considered to be particularly brutal IN HELL. Mash might not even survive to the end of the class!
[k]

？1：Wha...
？2：Why didn't you say so sooner!?

[k]

＠Beni-Enma
The isolated village effect will keep time from passing while you're there, so don't worry about your tasks here.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Chirp. Now, during your stay in cooking hell,[sr]you're going to learn three key principles.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
First: Cooking is politics!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
For example, let's say there's some ultra-premium Matsusaka beef here. Who wouldn't want to cook with a first-class ingredient like this?
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
But there's only so many high-quality ingredients to go around. And some can't be bought no matter how much money you have, chirp.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
So if you're going to set a dinner table with the best possible food, money alone isn't going to cut it.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
You need to network with farms and farmers, exchange contact info with good greengrocers, get on good terms with wholesale markets...
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Communication and negotiation skills are paramount. Chirp, as I said: politics. Chefs who neglect to play ball will never get the first pick of ingredients.

＠Beni-Enma
Second: Cooking is physics!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
As I trust it goes without saying, cooking is the art of the practical, not the stuff of hopes and dreams.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
If you think you can just get started with cooking in the hope that it all turns out okay...
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
...the only dishes you'll be able[sr]to make will be bland fluff!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Chirp, before you begin cooking, you need a solid plan, solid measurements, and solid handling!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I know what you're thinking.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
You think cooking is like a routine, where chefs just make the same thing over and over, day in and day out.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Chirp, that is where you're wrong![sr]Every dish a chef makes is its own work of art!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Like an author writing a different story with similar themes or events each and every day!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
It takes a lot of mental and physical energy. In fact, cheep, it's even harder than training with a sword.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Now that you've become students of the Enjaku Sewing technique, I will not be letting you off the hook with any easy dishes.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Be prepared to lose a kilogram from your Spirit Origin for every meal plan you overcome!

＠Beni-Enma
Third: Cooking is effort!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
“I wish I could cook, but I just don't have the knack.” “I followed the recipe perfectly, but it still didn't come out well.”
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
“It's so much trouble to keep things nutritionally balanced.” “I just don't want to spend so much time cooking.”
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Beni-Enma
Aaarrrggghhh! I wish I could purge every last[sr]one of those sour grapes from existence!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
The tastier a dish is, the more trouble it takes to make! That's just a fact, no matter how good you are!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Even when you find a new recipe, you need to read it all the way to the end and think about what it means.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Chirp, you need to think about how you can make it with the ingredients you have on hand, how best to please the people who are going to eat it...
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
It's a story, and you need to write[sr]the whole thing beginning to end!
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
If you just go around thinking things like “I wish I could be a good cook” or “Knights who can cook are so cool”...
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
...then you'll never learn how to cook well!

Now you listen to me, chirp. Cooking is not about talent. All you need is a will, and a way.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Being a good cook means never skipping steps or cutting corners, even when doing the same prep work over and over. It means you keep moving forward a little bit at a time.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
As long as you have the courage to do that three times a day, every day, until you die, anyone can learn!
