？1：Chocolate from Fujino...!

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V040]
Yes. There's nothing special about it[line 2]just think of it as chocolate from an older sister, but I hope you like it.[wait tVoice]

They taught home economics at the Reien Girls' Academy[line 2]that is, the school I went to.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V060]
I used to make donuts in that class all the time back when I was a first year. New students are supposed to make all sorts of sweets in home ec...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V070]
...so that they can give them to the seniors in their dorm. Hehe, pretty strange, right?[wait tVoice]
[k]


＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V080]
They were weirdly focused on athletics for a girls school, and they cared a lot about hierarchy.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Been there.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V090]
Really?[sr]So you used to live in a dorm too, [%1]?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V100]
You know, I'm glad to hear that.[sr]That means we have one more thing in common.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：I can't imagine what that's like.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V110]
Oh... R-right, of course.[sr]I'm sorry, I didn't mean to only talk about myself...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V120]
I got used to giving valentines in my dorm, so it shouldn't be a big deal, but I'm excited this year...[wait tVoice]
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V130]
Ahem. Go on, open it.[sr]I'm very proud of how these came out.[wait tVoice]

Since it's a special occasion,[sr]I used more sugar than I normally would.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V150]
I know as the older one, I probably should have taken care to make something healthier for you...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V160]
But just for today, I decided to give in to my delinquent side. It may not be much, but I wanted to ease the weight on your shoulders, even just by a little.[wait tVoice]
[k]


？1：...Thank you!
？2：You always were good at twisting things around!

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V170]
I'm so relieved to hear you like it.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Although, how come you went with donuts?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V180]
Oh... Well, uh...that's because...[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V190]
Going back to what I said before,[sr]my roommate was very...rambunctious...[wait tVoice]
[k]


[charaFace A 2]

“Who do these seniors think they are? Who cares about Reien rituals? If they want presents so badly, then that's just what I'll give them.”[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V210]
“The present of extra pounds straight to their gut![sr]Come on, Fujino, we've got deep-frying to do!”[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V220]
Then we would make lots of croquettes together, which is how I came to be so good at making deep-fried foods.[wait tVoice]
[k]


＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V230]
Hehe. Now you want a croquette too? Okay, I'll make you one just like Kokutou would some time.[wait tVoice]
[k]

[branch select01_end]


？2：Although, why'd you go with a bridge?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V240]
Huh...? Is that strange, making chocolate in the shape of a bridge...?[wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V250]
I only added it as a bonus, in case the donuts weren't enough to satisfy you...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V260]
Sweets are great on their own, but destroying buildings can be a lot of fun, too.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V270]
So I thought you might enjoy pretending to be a giant monster, even if the only building you destroy is made of chocolate...[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Good point. It does look like it'd be fun to break...
？2：(That's right. Her alignment is Evil, isn't it...!)

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V280]
Oh good. I'm proud of how that came out, too. I went back and forth on whether to make it more like the Eiffel Tower, but I'm glad I went with the bridge in the end.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V290]
The chocolate is a little hard, though,[sr]so I encourage you to really chomp down on it.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Fujino
[tVoice ValVoice_202900 0_V300]
I think you'll find breaking it to be very addictive.[sr]Please do let me know what you think later, okay?[wait tVoice]
