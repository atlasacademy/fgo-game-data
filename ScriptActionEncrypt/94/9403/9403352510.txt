Oho. Chocolate, huh.[wait tVoice]

？1：Do you not like chocolate?
？2：Not a fan of sweets?
？！

Nah, it's all good. Makes you feel more like a real Master of mine.[wait tVoice]

Who else would offer me chocolate when I can't taste anything anymore?[wait tVoice]

？1：O-oh no, I'm so sorry!
？！

No need to apologize.[sr]Good intentions are like sandpaper.[wait tVoice]

Things you use it on might get rougher, but they end up looking polished, right?[wait tVoice]

Sometimes, improved appearances are all you need.[sr]Besides...[wait tVoice]

Like they say, it's the thought that counts.[sr]Who cares how it tastes?[wait tVoice]

Although... This puts me in a tough situation. Only getting without giving back doesn't feel right.[wait tVoice]

＠Emiya Alter
[tVoice ValVoice_201600 0_V090]
In which case...hmm.[wait tVoice]

That's right. If you ever find yourself down an abyss, keep it around your waist.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
[tVoice ValVoice_201600 0_V120]
It's not especially long, but I can still probably use it to pull you up.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 4]

Unfortunately, I don't know anyone who needs saving.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
[tVoice ValVoice_201600 0_V140]
So it's better off with you, since I need you around in order to keep me around.[wait tVoice]

？1：Well, uh... Thanks.

＠Emiya Alter
[tVoice ValVoice_201600 0_V150]
Thanking me for pawning off my old junk on you, huh. How conscientious of you.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？2：This is a good present.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Emiya Alter
[tVoice ValVoice_201600 0_V160]
You think? It takes a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, but especially blood, not just to pull someone up with that, but to get pulled up by it, too.[wait tVoice]

...I knew it. I can't taste it at all.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
[tVoice ValVoice_201600 0_V190]
On top of that, it doesn't even provide anything in the way of nutrition for Servants. I'd be better of with rations.[wait tVoice]

＠Emiya Alter
[tVoice ValVoice_201600 0_V200]
Still... I'll still have to mark this as a special day in my diary.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_201600 0_V210]
Heh. I almost wonder what people would say if they knew I kept a diary.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
[tVoice ValVoice_201600 0_V220]
Never mind that it's just a way for me to keep track of things, since I can't even clearly recall what happened yesterday... Anyway.[wait tVoice]

If nothing else, your gift ought to get a wry smile out of me when I look back on this entry someday, Master.[wait tVoice]
