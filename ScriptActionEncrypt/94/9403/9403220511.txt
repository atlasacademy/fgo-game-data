Beast or not, facing such powerful Demon Boars is[sr]a frightening prospect... Still, a good experience.

Well done. You do rely on brute strength too much, but I can see from your form that you've spent a lot of time training.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I'm also glad you did not skip your leg days.[sr]Jumping about is perfectly fine in my book.

＠Beni-Enma
...They're actually much more docile now.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Back in the Enma-tei's heyday, Divine Beasts and Phantasmals ran rampant over these mountains.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
But these days, we've stopped getting guests, faith has weakened, and humans don't wander here anymore...

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
And as for the lack of guests, I'm sure[sr][%1] will figure something out.

So please don't worry, Ms. Beni-Enma.[sr]We've got it well in hand.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Well, kon kon, that's because[sr]I trust Master implicitly♪

[&He:She] did succeed at repairing all of humanity once,[sr]even if [&he:she] did have a lot of miraculous help.

And good things come to those who do good deeds.[sr]So no, I'm not worried whatsoever♡

Leave the front line to me, chirp. I've been building up an attack for three days that'll wreck them.

I'll hold them back with covering fire, chirp,[sr]without worrying about collateral damage.

I'm just going to make sure I stay[sr]alive to fight another day, chirp.

They've been around for the past hundred years, but didn't start making all this trouble until recently.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
They all came to the Enma-tei to seek refuge after the human world became uninhabitable, cheep.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I feel for them as they don't have anywhere else to go, so I don't want to exterminate them...

...chirp chirp, but I may have to[sr]if they keep getting more violent.

[charaFace B 1]

＠Beni-Enma
Oh, but I shouldn't be talking about this with guests.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I'm going to head back to the Enma-tei now, chirp.

You've all been working very hard, so tonight,[sr]I'm making wild boar hot pot to replenish all your energy!

I know our first priority is lifting our curse, Master, but I still can't help but wonder what sort of problems the Enma-tei itself is facing...
