This is a surprise. They say that Great King Enma[sr]is none other than the supreme judge of all of hell.
[k]

＠Kojirou
That he sentences the dead to different hells depending on the severity of their sins in life...
[k]

＠Kojirou
...and that he pulls out the tongues of any sinner who lies to try and escape their punishment.
[k]

＠Kojirou
In Buddhist tradition, he is known as “Yamaten" or "the first dead,” and that the Buddha himself made him a god and put him in charge of hell...
[k]

＠Kojirou
...but I am told that the ten king system developed among ordinary people when Buddhism was brought over from the continent.
[k]

＠Kojirou
In which case, these sparrows must be referring to the concept of hell that took root in Japan at the same time Buddhism did.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

In turn, Lady Beni-Enma lies at the crossroads between that concept of hell...

Madam Beni used to be human, chirp.
[k]

＠Sparrow (Gokan)
She was an apprentice prostitute who ran from her lodgings and captors, and died after she wandered into a mayoiga, chirp.
[k]

＠Sparrow (Gokan)
But before she died, she proved to be a great[sr]source of consolation for that mayoiga, chirp.
[k]

＠Sparrow (Gokan)
As a result, instead of being tried as a sinner, she ended up working for Datsue-ba at the Sanzu River.
[k]

＠Sparrow (Gokan)
Chirp. Unfortunately for her, Datsue-ba was stingy as[line 2]er, something of a cheapskate, chirp.

Even the other demons of hell thought that adopting a child just to save a few coins was going too far, chirp. Especially since she had already been sold and abused for money when she was alive.

Even today, some people think Datsue-ba inadvertently coined the Japanese for “money-grubber.”

＠Kojirou
To do that, they must offer up their clothes[sr]to pay a ferryman to carry them across.

Great King Enma then went on to entrust Madam Beni with the mayoiga, chirp chirp, which led to opening the Enma-tei here on Earth.

I've read about these sort of “mayoiga” before. It's a Japanese legend about a mysterious deserted house.

＠Mash
In modern times, a very famous Japanese author wrote about mayoiga for his stories.
[k]

＠Mash
The folklore says that the house is strewn with treasure everywhere you look, and that its dining table is covered in mouthwatering delicacies.
[k]

＠Mash
The people that wind up there find it suspicious that the house is deserted, but are inevitably unable to resist the luxuries they see all around them.
[k]

＠Mash
And once they try to take the treasure or eat the food, they're trapped in the house and end up dying.

But the Enma-tei doesn't have anything like that.[sr]It's exactly like the Sparrow Inn from the story.
