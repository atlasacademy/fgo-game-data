That's the Clock Tower, of course. The chalk-white pile of brick and mortar built by fanatics who proclaim it the bastion of mage knowledge.

＠El-Melloi II
They say they're searching for the Root, but all those bastards care about are their petty power struggles.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
Every night, it's nothing but a never-ending stream of scheming and backstabbing among the Twelve Lords and their associated mages.
[k]

？1：So, if you're a Lord too, does that mean you're kind of a big deal?
？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠El-Melloi II
What, you actually want me to say that myself?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠El-Melloi II
Once you become a Lord, even as low as the Modern Magecraft Department is on the totem pole, people start giving you special treatment.

I used to be the last in my family's line of succession, and my meals have been poisoned regularly since I was a child.
[k]


＠El-Melloi II
I got around that by carrying rations on my person, but of course, those taste terrible. So once I discovered how safe and delicious the sweets found in bakeries could be, I was hooked for life.
[k]

？1：That's awful...
？2：I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up bad memories.

But still, do you really have amnesia? What, did you hit your head or something? Oh, wait, I hit you in the head, didn't I.

＠El-Melloi II
Anyway, I trust you still remember about mages, yes?
[k]

？1：Come to think of it, I have my own rank.
？2：I think I was ranked Cause...?

？！


[charaFace A 7]


＠El-Melloi II
Huh? You're joking again, right? Cause might not be the highest rank, but it's still a rank for actual mages, not students!
[k]


＠El-Melloi II
There's no way you're even close to that point yet.
[k]

＠El-Melloi II
If you've got time for absurd flights of fancy like that, you've got time to do something more useful, like, say...carrying my bags.
[k]

Daydreaming is all well and good,[sr]but we have places to be.
