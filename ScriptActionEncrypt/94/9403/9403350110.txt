Hm? What sort of masterful writing could cause a man[sr]as great as myself to make such a careless mistake?

My beloved wife would be worried sick if she[sr]saw me so absorbed in a book, of all things.

In fact, she would almost certainly suspect me of using it to cover up adultery, or some other distasteful business!

By all means. I would be happy to let you read it.

[charaFace F 1]
＠Mash
Oh yes!
[k]

＠Mash
The way it's written really makes you feel as if you're right there watching the Greeks and Trojans waging this war on behalf of the Greek gods.

It's a tragic story, so full of death...

[charaFace F 1]
＠Mash
Yes, he did!
[k]

＠Mash
The Iliad was thought to be entirely fictional for a long time, but thanks to Heinrich Schliemann, an archaeologist from the late nineteenth century, many people now believe this story reflects real historic events.

It's a true Mystic, weaving history and mythology together like few other historical works.

This is it. The underground library.

＠Mash
I'm told it's a massive new library that just showed up here one day, separate from the one we already have.
[k]

＠Mash
It might seem like it takes up a lot of room, but they say it's actually using magecraft to bend the space around it.
[k]

＠Mash
As a result, it fits entirely in the storage area, and doesn't get in the way of the Magical Reactor or other support systems at all.

Murasaki Shikibu was born in Japan during the Heian period, just like Raikou and Kintoki.

[charaFace F 1]

Yes! She's best known for The Tale of Genji,[sr]the very first novel in recorded history!

＠Mash
It takes place during the Heian period, focusing specifically on noble society and the exploits of its titular character Hikaru Genji.

But Murasaki Shikibu was also a famous tanka poet. Some of her poems are included in the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu, which is still used in karuta to this day.
