Ghh! I suppose I should have expected this from the renowned queen of a foreign nation!

I could say the same about you. Hehe, you know,[sr]I like both working women and fighting women.

[charaFace E 11]

＠Whip Oni
I don't know how I feel about women who devote themselves entirely to someone else, though. That's no way to live, right?

[charaFace E 14]

＠Whip Oni
You need to take charge of your life and own whatever it is you want! Like these horses!

She's started performing a very, um, provocative dance on one of the merry-go-round's horses...

Shuten could pull that off, but you just look ridiculous. If you wanna devour the horses, then just devour them and be done with it already!
