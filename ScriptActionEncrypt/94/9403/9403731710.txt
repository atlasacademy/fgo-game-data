I think I might have figured out who did this.

Really? Are you sure?

＠Adriana
Then, how did they make sure that only Gabriela's glass would be poisoned?

＠Elise
That's just it. We shouldn't have assumed that Gabriela's glass was the only one that was poisoned.
[k]

＠Elise
The truth is, they were all poisoned. She would have collapsed no matter which one she chose.

＠Elise
I see I wasn't clear enough. Sorry about that.
[k]

＠Elise
What I mean is that the wine contained only trace amounts of poison. It wouldn't be nearly enough to make a healthy person sick by itself.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Elise
But what if that same poison had been building up in that same someone's body day by day, and the trace amounts in the wine were enough to trigger symptoms?

Interesting. I never considered that possibility.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Roma
But if that is true...
[k]

＠Roma
...it would mean whoever is responsible for this would have to have been capable of poisoning Gabriela's food and drink every day.

Exactly. And the only one who could do something like that...is a servant here in the mansion.

That's right. I'm looking at you.

You've been hanging around us this whole time,[sr]making sure to watch everything we do.

There's no telling what kind of sneaky shit you could've gotten up to if you felt like it.

Come on, Kaoru. Aren't you ready to wake up?
[k]

＠Elise
Did you honestly forget your real name?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Elise
You know, I spent a lot of time thinking about what[sr]I was gonna say to you when I finally saw you again.
[k]

＠Elise
But all I could come up with was trite shit[sr]like “Long time no see” or “How've you been?”...
[k]

＠Elise
Still, I eventually figured that as long as you still remembered me, what I said wouldn't be important.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Elise
But then it didn't even seem like you recognized me, and before I knew it, I was trashing you right to your face.
[k]

＠Elise
I...I was sure that would at least get your attention, and I'd finally hear how you really felt.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Elise
I never thought you'd collapse from being poisoned before I got the chance.

＠Elise
I don't care if you want to start back up where we left off, or if you never want to see me again. I just want to hear how you really feel...no matter how long it takes.
