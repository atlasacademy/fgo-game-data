As you know, I'm a Divine Spirit, and an incredibly ancient one at that. My Spirit Origin may not be THE oldest around, for various reasons...[wait tVoice]

...but I can imagine all too easily how difficult it must have been to summon me, even with Chaldea's systems.[wait tVoice]

＠Quetzalcoatl
[tVoice ValVoice_401800 0_V160]
Forming a contract with me couldn't have been easy, either. You overcame so many obstacles in order to choose me.[wait tVoice]
