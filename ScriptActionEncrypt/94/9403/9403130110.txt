I was all set to deliver presents to good boys and girls with my trusty sheep, Zerco, again...

...but apparently no Santa can keep the job two years in a row, no matter how good they may be at it.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Altera Santa
But, even if there will be no more Altera Santa, there will always be a Santa. This year, I think it should be you who takes up the mantle.

[charaFace A 13]

＠Altera Santa
Ho ho ho. If you asked me to give you a reason for that, I would say it's because you and I are somewhat...similar?

I just have a sense that we share similar roots.[sr]Call it an Altera hunch.
