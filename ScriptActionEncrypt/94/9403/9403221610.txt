＠Goredolf
Hmm... I'm glad we now have four of the five treasures, but we still haven't had any luck with the fifth...
[k]

＠Goredolf
What even is a swallow's cowry, anyway!? And what's a shell doing in a swallow's nest in the first place!?
[k]

＠Goredolf
I've been known to partake in the occasional “swallow's nest” dish myself... Does that mean this so-called shell is a swallow that is eaten like a shellfish!?

No, no, I doubt it's anything as awful as that.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
In The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, the five treasures are precious things meant to be impossible to obtain.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
The swallow's cowry is a shell that a swallow happened to pick up and carried back to its nest, where it served as the base for the nest.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
It's easily the most realistic of all the five treasures.[sr]The catch is that finding one is all a matter of luck.

Well, if our only choice is to rely on luck,[sr]there is little point in dwelling on it.

＠Diarmuid
Master, might I suggest we visit[sr]the hot springs to clear our heads?

Yes, why don't we go bathe in the hot springs? They say that refreshing one's spirit can also raise one's luck.

＠Kojirou
I had no idea it was in such dire straits. That is why I have been here indulging myself in these hot springs since lunchtime.
[k]

＠Kojirou
Compared to all of your valiant efforts, I may as well be an evanescent cloud in the autumn sky.

＠Kojirou
All that aside... Five precious treasures, you say? What a fiendishly difficult task. And yet, something seems amiss.
[k]

＠Kojirou
You say this was the bamboo cutter[sr]from the tale of the same name?
[k]

＠Kojirou
According to that tale, his adopted daughter Kaguyahime said the following to the five men who came from the city to seek her hand in marriage:
[k]

＠Kojirou
“I cannot understand why any of you would wish[sr]to marry me, when you know nothing of who I am.”
[k]

＠Kojirou
“If you wish to take me for your bride, you must show that your love for me will never fade.”
[k]

＠Kojirou
She told each only to return after they had found one of five impossible treasures as proof of their love.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Kojirou
Each of the five suitors set off to find the treasures as best they could...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Kojirou
...but not a one succeeded.
[k]

＠Kojirou
Which is why I find it strange that this bamboo cutter claimed to possess all five of them.
[k]

？1：...
？2：(Then...does that mean...)

？！

[charaFace F 4]

＠Kojirou
I never expected that you would now be undergoing the same trials depicted in that old tale... Indeed, I am surprised you have time to luxuriate in the hot springs yourself.
[k]

＠Kojirou
I wish I could help you, but alas, the only thing I am good at is swinging a pole.
[k]

＠Kojirou
Unlike the rest, I soar not through the sky, nor spark flashes of light, or any other remarkable deeds.
[k]

＠Kojirou
As such, all I can do for you is rattle this[sr]cowry and pray for your success. Forgive me.
[k]

？1：...Hey.
？2：...Heeey!

？！

[charaFace F 5]

＠Kojirou
Yes? What is it, [&Lord:Lady] [%1]? Is there[sr]something you wish to know about my rare seashell accessory? (Showing it off)

...but now, I finally understand. Here.[sr]I am happy to let you have this shell.

＠Kojirou
I am not so poor as to draw my blade over a single shell, nor so quick to anger that I would challenge another over it.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Kojirou
Now then, I think I shall be on my way. My only regret is that I never got to duel the madam during my stay.
[k]

＠Kojirou
I would have liked to know if my secret sword is strong enough to stand up to that sparrow...
[k]

＠Kojirou
...but alas, I will have to hope that question is answered another day.
