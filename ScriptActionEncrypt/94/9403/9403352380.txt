And since I have time to spare, I am willing to do things I normally wouldn't consider. Make no mistake, it is not because all the others' bubbly antics have rubbed off on me.[wait tVoice]

Don't be an idiot. Look closer! Do you really think a product like that would be part of any distribution line!?[wait tVoice]

I put all one hundred of my personas' heads together to make it. I still have a headache from the arguments we had.[wait tVoice]

One of them insisted bitter was better, one of them said crunchy or nothing...[wait tVoice]

One of them insisted on white chocolate, while another wanted strawberry...[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_600300 0_V090]
Yet another one of them said we should just give you Saint Quartz instead... It was a mess.[wait tVoice]

In the end, the only thing we could all agree on was including everyone's ideas, so that's how it ended up like that.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_600300 0_V110]
Good grief... I can't believe we even ended up making the packaging ourselves. If I'd known it would be this much trouble, I would have insisted on a cake like I originally[line 2][wait tVoice]

＠Hassan of the Hundred Personas
[tVoice ValVoice_600300 0_V120]
...Never mind. Just forget you heard that. Anyway, I suppose it might not look like much...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hassan of the Hundred Personas
[tVoice ValVoice_600300 0_V130]
...but I can more or less vouch for its taste. Maybe a little sugar will help wake up that dull brain of yours.[wait tVoice]

？1：Maybe it will. Thanks, Hassan!

G-good. I'm glad you like it.[wait tVoice]

I couldn't possibly be less interested in a foreign culture's festivities, but if it will help my summoner, well, I suppose I don't mind participating.[wait tVoice]

Now, I'm going back to my room! I've been having extremely bad premonitions as of late, you see![wait tVoice]

I must train myself to be ready for anything, just in case the First One is summoned![wait tVoice]
