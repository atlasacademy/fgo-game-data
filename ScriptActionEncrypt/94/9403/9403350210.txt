I see. This certainly is a lively place...
[k]

？1：First time at a cafeteria?

＠Murasaki Shikibu
In fact, yes.
[k]

＠Murasaki Shikibu
Usually, I prefer to keep to myself, surrounded by nothing more than books and words.
[k]

＠Murasaki Shikibu
I have no wish to boast, but even as a child, I would frequently read books meant for male scholars.
[k]

？2：I take it you don't usually leave the library much?

＠Murasaki Shikibu
No, I suppose I don't.[sr]My intention is not to be a shut-in, though...
[k]

＠Murasaki Shikibu
...but I suppose I do usually end up perusing my library's collections whenever I have a spare moment.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Murasaki Shikibu
I was unaware just how much I had neglected to get to know so many others. This simply will not do.
