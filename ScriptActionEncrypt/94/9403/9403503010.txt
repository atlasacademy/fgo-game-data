＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Oh, oops. Sorry about that. Temporary or not, a good wet nurse should worry about her charges, not the other way around.

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Don't worry, I'm perfectly fine!

Yes?

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
This floor just reminded me how difficult this,[sr]um, particular subject was for me to teach.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I certainly taught him the bare minimum he needed to know, but when it came to, er, practical applications...
[k]


＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Well, I figured he would learn that sort of thing naturally, just by spending time around his pages of the same age.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
That's why, sometimes, I would even look the other way when his pages would take him to visit the castle town.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
That sounds just like...
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Yes. In fact... Lord Yoshimune, was it? That story of his you were studying may not have been far from the truth.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
The fact is, there are some things that it's just not possible to teach inside Edo Castle alone.

I see. I suspected something[sr]like that may have happened.

Indeed, Mitsuyoshi may well have taught the shogun things he should not have known...

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
As your acting wet nurse, let me ask you this now:[sr]How are things of this nature handled in the future?
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
For example, when I discovered Lord Iemitsu had hidden obscene drawings in his room, there were a great many things I wanted to say to him...
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
...but after thinking it over, I decided to simply arrange them neatly on his floor without saying a word.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Was that the right way to handle that?
[k]

？1：(Hang in there, Lord Iemitsu...!)
？2：A lot of mothers do that kind of thing in our time, too.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Do they now! I knew it! Now I feel like patting myself on the back for once!

Yeaaah, there's definitely a lot of, um, pitfalls with that particular subject. And it's even more difficult given how important it is.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
If nothing else, we can definitely say this Ooku isn't doing anything good for that kind of education.

Maybe this is the labyrinth's way of telling us to give those Kama...clones? More attention.

So if we want to proceed, maybe we need to go down the paths where there's more of them.

If need be, I'll hold my hands over your eyes to stop you from seeing anything you shouldn't!
