I was told you wished to see me, [&Lord:Lady] [%1]. How may I be of service?[wait tVoice]

Heh, I only jest. It would be crude of me to feign ignorance. I could tell from how you darted about like a [&dragonfly:rabbit] just what this concerns.[wait tVoice]

This is the time of year in which it is customary to give gifts to those we care for deeply, colloquially known as Valentine's Day.[wait tVoice]

Hahaha, I suppose my appearance runs contrary to my knowledge. Over my many years as a Servant, I have come to learn a few things about the ways of the modern world.[wait tVoice]

If it is advice you seek, you have come to the right Servant. So, whom do you wish to present with chocolate?[wait tVoice]

I presume it is that man with the long golden hair? The one with the handsome face and elegant body known as Fio[line 2][wait tVoice]

？1：No, it's you, Sasaki.
？2：No, it's you, Kojirou.

It seems I have a great deal more training to do before I can boast of my knowledge. I would be honored and delighted to accept your gift.[wait tVoice]

I am in your debt. Part of me would like nothing better than to go around showing this off to the other Heroic Spirits, but I shall do my best to refrain.[wait tVoice]

Now then, [%1], could I ask you for a moment of your time?[wait tVoice]

＠Sasaki Kojirou

I am a man bereft of possessions, and thus have nothing to give you in return.[wait tVoice]

But, if I do nothing to repay this kindness, regret is sure to linger in my heart and dull my blade.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_600100 0_V150]
I am afraid I can think of but one way to repay you. Would you be so kind as to come with me to the best view this poor swordsman can show you?[wait tVoice]
