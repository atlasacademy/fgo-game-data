Theoretically speaking, the steam engine that enables my locomotive abilities should prove that the Carnot cycle has practical real-world applications.[wait tVoice]

Mage. Your path may differ greatly from mine, but we are both in constant pursuit of knowledge. To put this in terms you can more easily understand...[wait tVoice]

...it is the most thermally efficient cycle a steam engine can possibly attain. To accomplish it, my steam circulates between high and low temperatures via four separate processes.[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_501100 0_V040]
Specifically, isothermal expansion, adiabatic expansion, isothermal compression, and adiabatic compression.[wait tVoice]

In other words, it's a quasi-static cyclic process that[line 2][wait tVoice]

Now, getting back to our earlier discussion: I should be able to use the chocolate you possess as fuel for my steam engine without issue.[wait tVoice]

My locomotion may employ a steam engine, but it is also a Mystic with deep ties to magical energy.[wait tVoice]

Am I wearing a machine made of iron and steel,[sr]or the manifestation of a Mystic?[wait tVoice]

＠Babbage
[tVoice ValVoice_501100 0_V110]
I cannot say one way or the other. I suspect the answer is “both,” but that is merely speculation.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：So, in other words...?

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Babbage
[tVoice ValVoice_501100 0_V120]
That chocolate can also serve as a source of magical energy, correct? Then I shall have no problem imbibing it.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：In that case, let's try this again.
？2：Happy Valentine's Day!

According to the ancient Greek mathematician, Pythagoras, everything that exists originates in numbers.[wait tVoice]

＠Babbage
[tVoice ValVoice_501100 0_V150]
How right he was. In Pythagoras' time, Mystics and logic were one and the same. That is surely true for my body, too.[wait tVoice]

＠Babbage
[tVoice ValVoice_501100 0_V160]
Thus, let me now say this: learn from numbers, young mage. Become intimately familiar with them.[wait tVoice]

＠Babbage
[tVoice ValVoice_501100 0_V170]
Do that, and one day, you will surely arrive at truths I was unable to see...[wait tVoice]

For you are young, learning, and filled with endless possibilities.[wait tVoice]
