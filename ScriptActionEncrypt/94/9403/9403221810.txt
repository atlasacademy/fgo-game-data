＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Indeed. We need to have everything look[sr]exactly as it did five hundred years ago.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
I believe the term for it is “on-site inspection.”[sr]Even better, it doubles as a lookout tower.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
It should let us bear witness to all sorts[sr]of things, just like Chaldea's simulator.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
If we can recreate the scene of the crime five hundred years ago, we should see exactly what happened.

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Now that the building is restored to its past state...and with my Clairvoyance, which allows me to see things clearly and with incredible detail...

Of course! The Salmon of Knowledge!
[k]

＠Goredolf
It's a story that dates back to when Fionn mac Cumhaill was apprenticed to a druid named Finegas.
[k]

＠Goredolf
Together they caught a rainbow-colored salmon that was said to impart wisdom to whomever ate it.
[k]

＠Goredolf
Fionn cleaned and cooked the fish in order[sr]to serve it to his mentor, but then[line 2]

Yes. Some of the salmon's oil got on[sr]Fionn's thumb while he was cooking it...
[k]

...and that caused its wisdom crystals[sr]to reside within Fionn's thumb.
[k]

[charaFace G 15]

Indeed. It scares me that he could have intentionally had fate work in his favor like that...

Haha. No, as much as I wish I could claim credit for that, it really was just a coincidence. It's one of the most embarrassing episodes of my entire life.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
But my mentor, Finegas, just smiled[sr]and told me this is how it should be.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
He said that the Salmon of Knowledge was part of nature, and that my actions were similarly natural.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
“In which case, it's only right that it resides in you. But you must forgive me if I take pity on you, golden-haired mac Cumhaill.”
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
“After all, you will need to bite your thumb at every sign of trouble from here on! It makes me laugh just thinking about it!”

Of course, I was still happy with this outcome.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Finegas had been searching for the Salmon his whole life, yet he was still happy that I received its wisdom, even after I inadvertently stole it from him.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
And that's one of the least outlandish things that happened to me. Really, it's no wonder I became the captain of the Knights of Fianna.

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
I'm looking at the facts of this case, of course.[sr]There are any number of ways to learn about the past.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Some use Mystic Eyes or crystals to view it directly. Others use accurate information and a reconstruction.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
I favor the latter method, of course. Here in this lookout tower, I was able to recreate the Enma-tei's previous state in my mind.
[k]

？1：Whoa. Then, you know who took the treasures?

？！

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Oh, I already knew that beyond any doubt. No, I merely wanted to know what the room looked like back then.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
As long as I can calculate that, all that remains is to resolve this to the best of our shared ability.

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
That's right. Figuring the one responsible was easy,[sr]but proving it will be far more difficult.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Not even collecting all five treasures[sr]will be enough to handle everything.
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
“Hmm, I see. Yes, these are indeed five treasures,[sr]but they are not the ones I had stolen.”
[k]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
“They may be the same objects, but their value differs greatly. I don't want just any old treasures returned to me. They must be the ones that were taken.”
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
If the bamboo cutter counters along those lines[line 2]and make no mistake, he almost certainly will[line 2]we won't have a leg to stand on.

＠Fionn mac Cumhaill
Hmm. What about Madam Beni-Enma?[sr]Is she capable of seeing through lies, too?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
No, Ms. Beni-Enma doesn't have any such ability.[sr]She just punishes people when they're caught lying.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
She learned her Enjaku Battoujutsu[sr]from the Great King Enma himself.

Once it becomes clear that someone is lying, that's when she'll cut off their tongue on the spot.

In essence, we'll all be putting on a performance. Or, in the language of a middle-aged man we know, a con.
