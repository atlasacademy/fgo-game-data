My family was right in sticking with Lord Akechi and Lord Kobayakawa! Lord Akechi was right in his betrayal, and Lord Kobayakawa was too!

Oh, yes. Back then, it was customary for boys from other samurai families close in age to the shogun heir...
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
...to be assigned to him as retainers[sr]right after he was born.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
My own son, Senkuma, was one of Takechiyo's pages,[sr]and so was Choushirou...
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
...the boy who would later be known as Matsudaira Nobutsuna. So I basically raised him, too.

[charaFace B 17]

Come to think of it, a certain someone's son was another one of the shogun's pages...

Anyway, Nobutsuna was always smart, but I'm afraid I might have focused on developing his intelligence to the detriment of other important qualities. I should have known better.
[k]

？1：So he's an INT build then.
？2：So he's more of a strategist than a soldier, huh.
？！

[charaFace B 11]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
He also gained the nickname “Wise Izu” at one point after he was assigned to guard Izu Province as Izu-no-Kami. Maybe that went to his head?
[k]

？！

Nobutsuna was one of the warriors assigned to protect the shogun. He is moderately skilled, but he always appeared to lack the resolve needed to walk the path of the sword.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
However...his own skill aside,[sr]he is intimately familiar with warfare.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
In that one sense, he is as strong[sr]as the fiercest samurai.

After Lord Ieyasu won the Siege of Osaka and united the country, Japan went several decades without knowing war.

[charaFace B 13]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
But then, it struck again[sr]during Shogun Iemitsu's reign.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
This was not a battle between warring daimyo, but a revolt led by civilians called the Shimabara Rebellion. Perhaps you've heard of it?

Nobutsuna was the general who led the shogunate's efforts to suppress it.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
That should tell you how highly Shogun[sr]Iemitsu valued his abilities.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
That may be why he came to be one of the few samurai who still knew war well, even in times of peace.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Still...I remember the look in Nobutsuna's eyes the day he returned from Shimabara.
[k]

They were the eyes of a man[sr]who had witnessed hell itself.
