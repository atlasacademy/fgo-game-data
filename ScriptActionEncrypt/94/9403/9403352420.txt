If a hapless puppy is crying in the east, she lends him her sword! If a cheeky deerlet is injured in the west, she lends her her shield![wait tVoice]

Yes, it's warrior Elisabeth Báthory, Halloween brave, back for her much requested encore![wait tVoice]

？1：I don't remember hearing any calls for an encore...
？2：You do know “warrior” and “brave” mean the same thing, right?

Monks are so different from the warrior class that I can't even imagine what it must be like being one...[wait tVoice]

I've never done anything like this before, so I didn't know how to go about it... Tamamo did tell me not to make an octopus or anything red, but that's all...[wait tVoice]
