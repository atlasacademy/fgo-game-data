＠
I have never thought myself superior to others.[sr]I have never assumed I know better than them.
[k]

＠
But at times, I have wondered why[sr]people think the way they do.
[k]

＠
We choose and recommend good things because they are good. We shun bad things because they are bad.
[k]

＠
Almost everything in this world proceeds smoothly[sr]as long as one keeps those two ideas in mind.
[k]

＠
Politics. Relationships. Economics. And though I only experienced it once, even war was no exception.
[k]

＠
If you cannot clearly ascertain which is the good and which is the bad, all you need do is compare them.
[k]

＠
If it is difficult to compare them, all you need do is try another perspective that makes comparison easier.[sr]That is all.
[k]

＠
Which is why I could never understand why following this process led to me being known as “Wise Izu.”
[k]

＠
This is not wisdom. All I ever did was follow this logic to its natural conclusion.
[k]

＠
I did what needed to be done, and refrained from doing what should not be done.
[k]

＠
It is a simple process, as straightforward as the spring that drives mechanical dolls. If it is wound, they move.[sr]If not, they stay still. There is nothing more to it.
[k]

＠
I knew there were some who did not like me for consistently taking such a simple approach.
[k]

＠
Those people would say that I was clever,[sr]but also cold and heartless.
[k]

＠
But, there is nothing I could do about that.[sr]This is the only way I know.
[k]

＠
When that woman proved herself a genuine deity beyond any doubt, and humiliated Tokugawa beyond measure...
[k]

＠
...the same logic I have always followed determined this was good. Nobody can defeat a god, no matter how hard one tries. Therefore...

Of course people will indulge in what they think to be good, Lord Munenori. You only chose to indulge in alcohol and tobacco because you found them to be good.

Neither alcohol nor tobacco ever tasted good to me, so I avoided them as something bad. That is all there is to it.
