What's with everyone going back and forth between the cafeteria and their rooms? How many round trips are they gonna make before they get sick of it?[wait tVoice]

Guess it doesn't matter whether you're human or Heroic Spirit today. It's great that everyone's having fun and all...[wait tVoice]

...but just because things are peaceful right now doesn't mean everything's fine. Whether we're talking the Incineration of Humanity, or the Reconstruction of Humanity, we[line 2]Hm?[wait tVoice]

Hey, [%1]. You here to hand out chocolate, too?[wait tVoice]

＠Cú Chulainn
[tVoice ValVoice_502100 0_V050]
You should head to the cafeteria then. There's a bunch of eager Servants trying to contain their excitement there now.[wait tVoice]

I just came back from there myself. It was so uncomfortable in there I just couldn't take it any more.[wait tVoice]

But if I'm being really honest, this extra wisdom I've got makes it hard to get on board.[wait tVoice]

？1：Makes sense. Here, have some chocolate.
？2：I get it. Here, have some chocolate.

What's that? Aren't I happy about this?[sr]All right, look...[wait tVoice]

I don't mind Halloween, but I'm not so fickle that I'm about to go running off into the arms of other countries' holidays whenever one happens to roll around.[wait tVoice]

But, I'm also not so childish that I'm going to complain about a gift you gave me directly.[wait tVoice]

Don't get me wrong, it's not childish to be contrarian when everyone else is having a good time. What's childish is pretending you're not happy when you actually are.[wait tVoice]

But hey, I'm pretty much just play-acting at being a druid anyway, aren't I! Guess there's no point in trying to act cool now![wait tVoice]

...But first, you're gonna need a staff. It's a rough path for the uninitiated, after all...[wait tVoice]

We can start by looking for a good ash tree. Since I am a Caster and all, I may as well act like it sometimes, right?[wait tVoice]
