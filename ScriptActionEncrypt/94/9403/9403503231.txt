Oh? I see, I see. Well, I can certainly[sr]understand how they must feel.
[k]

＠Tokugawa Goredolf
However, this is the Ooku. A place where the shogun can relax and enjoy himself however he pleases.
[k]

＠Tokugawa Goredolf
Besides, knowing when to put formalities aside is the mark of a truly broad-minded shogun.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]

＠Tokugawa Goredolf
So I grant you all permission to relax and recuperate here in my glorious Tokugawa Ooku as well.
[k]

＠Tokugawa Goredolf
Now come on, pick yourselves[sr]up and have a seat right here.
[k]

＠Tokugawa Goredolf
We can crack open another bottle of wine, partake in some delicious meat, and enjoy ourselves here forever.
[k]

？1：Di...rector...
？2：You're not a...Tokugawa...
？！

[charaFace H 7]

＠Tokugawa Goredolf
Oh, wait, are you a Tokugawa too? You are, aren't you?[sr]Well then, all the more reason not to hold back!
[k]

[charaFace H 0]

＠Tokugawa Goredolf
So, that would mean...we're related? I see, I see.[sr]I like that. That means I can truly let my hair down!
[k]

[charaFace H 1]

＠Tokugawa Goredolf
Surely there can't be any problem now. Let's all just relax and enjoy ourselves here. What do you say?
[k]

？1：(What a kind...offer...)
？2：(That sounds...really good...)

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
Surely you of all people can understand, Tajima-no-kami. This is the Ooku's innermost chamber. The ultimate place reserved for the Tokugawa shogun.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
Here, a Tokugawa can truly be who they are.[sr]The significance of their title is stronger than ever.
[k]

＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
Thus, anyone who knows the authority a Tokugawa wields cannot help but obey what they say here.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Matsudaira Nobutsuna
Even if that Tokugawa should be a new[sr]Tokugawa from a Western country...

It's nothing so overt as using your[sr]voice to directly control others.
[k]

＠Kama
It's like an unconscious nudge that makes you feel like going along with whatever they say would be a good idea.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Kama
Oh, I have that same property too, of course.[sr]And for a Tokugawa retainer...
[k]

＠Kama
...I'd imagine this works on an instinctual level, before you can even think about reaching for your sword.
[k]


[charaFace A 1]
＠Kama
So for Servants who've had their Spirit Origins pummeled half to death, or a human on the verge of turning Tokugawa [&himself:herself]...
[k]


＠Kama
...that property alone might be more than strong enough for a finishing blow.
