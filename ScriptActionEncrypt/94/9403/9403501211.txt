I don't mean like that! I mean this floor[line 2]this whole fake Ooku is making me sick!
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I always thought it was strange that it had turned into an underground labyrinth, but now it's even stranger!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
This kind of structure shouldn't[sr]even be possible for the Ooku...
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Places that used to have a lavatory are now just hallways, and many of these sliding doors just lead to dead-ends.
[k]


？1：True, these routes we've been taking are almost dizzying...

This floor seems to be using its own bizarre labyrinthine construction to impede us.
[k]

＠Mash
I can tell how unique it is just from mapping it out.

＠Mash
And as a result, your walking speed has been getting slower and slower...

Well, I guess my basic knowledge of the Ooku still applies, no matter how bizarre its new structure may be.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
After that, it all just comes down to figuring out the architect's habits, and a little bit of intuition! It's nothing that impressive, really.

Surely there can be none more familiar with the Ooku's workings than you, Lady Fuku.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Your knowledge easily surpasses the shogun's or Lord Doi Toshikatsu, to say nothing of myself.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
You did well choosing the Ooku's most knowledgeable person for your guide, Master. Perhaps the heavens are on our side.
[k]

？1：I can't take credit for that. That was all Par.

Now that you mention the heavens... Hmm, you do[sr]have a rather virtuous face, [&Lord:Lady] [%1].
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I suspect you still have some wonderful latent talent lying dormant... The kind with lots of room left to grow.
[k]

？1：Y-you think so?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I do!
[k]

？2：I think you're giving me too much credit.

[charaFace A 11]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Oh? I've spent much of my life watching over a child who grew up to become a great shogun. Do you really think I don't know what I'm talking about?
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
All right, I've made up my mind. If fate brought us together, then I'm going to make the most of it!
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
While we're down here walking this labyrinth, I'll take you all under my wing and educate you as is any good wet nurse's duty!
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
If there's anything you'd like to[sr]know more about, just say the word!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I'm excellent at cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, sewing, and mediating between the worlds inside and outside the Ooku if I do say so myself.
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
I can take care of anything that needs doing in a flash,[sr]and I'm also the type who needs to keep busy all the time.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Honestly, it's been depressing for me to go through this labyrinthine Ooku in silence, especially with this bizarre layout.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Of course, I'm happy to completely devote myself to finding a way through it if it means rescuing the shogun...
[k]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
...but that doesn't mean there's no time for a few diversions along the way. In fact, I'd even say they're necessary.

If there's something you want to know or don't understand, you should ask about it right away.[sr]That's very important.

...So on that note, I might have a few questions for you myself from time to time, if you don't mind answering them.

[charaFace A 3]

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Oh my, you're rather shrewd, aren't you...

＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Honestly, yes, I am intensely curious to hear what things are like in the future.

Nothing brings me more joy than raising talented people, which is why I'm also very passionate about self-improvement.

[charaFace A 5]
＠Kasuga-no-Tsubone
Now let's move quickly, but not so quickly that[sr]we can't have a nice conversation on the way!
