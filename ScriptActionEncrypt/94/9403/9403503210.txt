＠Kama
When I first showed up here, I started out by creating a single room that I could make into anything I liked.
[k]

＠Kama
It was a tiny little zone[line 2]a part of me, in a way[line 2]that I fit into a bit of empty space inside the real Ooku.
[k]

＠Kama
I then invited Lord Iemitsu to join me there once he paid the Ooku a visit. All it took was a few words, and a few steps off his usual path.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Kama
Once he came inside, I entertained him myself. I didn't stop until he was satisfied. I didn't stop until he forgot about eeeverything else.
[k]

He must have been sooo exhausted from his duties, because he put up almost no fight at all.

[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Kama
Anyway, after I'd gotten hold of Lord Iemitsu's soul...I followed his bonds, his connections to gather more material.
[k]

＠Kama
I started with the other people in the Ooku, then I spread out to cover everyone in Edo Castle.
[k]

＠Kama
I dipped down into the nearby castle town too,[sr]but only a little here and there.

[charaTalk E]
[charaFace E 14]
[charaFadein E 0.1 1]

＠Kama
Oh no, I still didn't have nearly enough material for that. That's why I next decided to follow Lord Iemitsu's connections vertically.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_72 1.0]

＠Kama
And by that...I mean through time,[sr]to his past and future.
[k]

？1：!?
？！

[charaFace E 0]

＠Kama
Lord Iemitsu had a lot of deep ties in all sorts of concepts. The Tokugawa family, the shogun, the shogunate... So I went looking for people with some connection to those, both in the past and the future.
[k]

[charaFace E 15]

＠Kama
Then I basically took aaall of their life energy[line 2]sorry, their souls, and made them into materials.

＠Kama
That's right. They're the souls of several shogun from the past and future. As you'd expect, being a shogun is very significant, so I made all of them into anchors.
[k]

＠Kama
Still, I only used them as guidelines when I was making the other floors, so I didn't really need any of them besides this first one once I was done.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]

＠Kama
In the end, I just repurposed them as a power source for the attendants. Wait, have you been collecting them and using them yourself?

I didn't have to use the Tokugawa bonds.[sr]I didn't have to make a new Ooku at all.

＠Kama
It could have been the Topkapı Palace harem, or China's inner palace. It's all the same to me.

I only went with the Ooku because it happened to catch my eye at the right time.

What do you call it? Novum Chaldea? It would usually be impossible for me to do anything with a bizarre place like that.
[k]

＠Kama
The only reason I could manage it at all, [%1], is because you and I are tied together through fate.
[k]

＠Kama
It's all thanks to that fate that[sr]my voice was able to reach Chaldea.
[k]

＠Kama
I'd hoped that just inviting you here would be enough, like it was with Chubs here.
[k]

＠Kama
But once the alchemist caught on and got in the way, I decided to have you make your way through this Ooku of your own volition.

＠Kama
