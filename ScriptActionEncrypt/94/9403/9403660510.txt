That's right. And luckily for us,[sr]it hasn't been touched since that Assassin ran off.

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Reines
It's simple once you figure it out. Remember what[sr]I told you about how Pseudo-Servants like me...
[k]


＠Reines
...are made by having a Heroic Spirit possess a human vessel? Well, it's the same principle at work here.
[k]

＠Reines
This automaton was given a specific person's memories, causing them to behave as if they were that person.
[k]

＠Reines
I'd guess this piece of paper is infused with[sr]magical energy designed to facilitate that.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Reines
The queen, M, and Shakespeare knew that,[sr]but they all forgot as well.

That's right! I remember now![bgm BGM_EVENT_103 0.1]

＠M
Salieri wasn't able to become a Servant here!
[k]

＠M
He didn't have the Spirit Origin he needed!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠M
So he ended up wandering around[sr]the Tower of London as a ghost...
[k]

＠M
Yes... That's why I[line 2]ah, Shakespeare and I decided to create him ourselves!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠M
I came up with the plan, and Shakespeare wrote it out. That piece of paper we happened across even provided us with the magical energy we needed!
[k]

＠M
When we were done, we introduced our Salieri[sr]to the queen, and she accepted him as he was.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠M
So then...how could we forget?[sr]How could I have forgotten?

The rest probably comes down[sr]to plain old wear and tear.

＠Reines
There's a reason why you need to tune delicate instruments before and after using them, after all.
[k]

＠Reines
When you all forgot the truth about your[sr]automaton pianist, and stopped tuning it...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

...its interior workings must have deteriorated,[sr]culminating in it actually trying to harm us.

It's been around for a long time. I believe[sr]it was built by a puppeteer from the Far East.

As I recall, it was a failed creation of theirs[sr]that was only ever useful as a prototype.

＠M
Oh... Well, I can't say you're wrong.
[k]

＠M
But I truly did love that piano. It was beautiful.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠M
Good, evil, none of that matters in the presence of true beauty. Even if we measure such things by different standards, they cannot be ignored.
[k]

＠M
For there is great worth in beauty...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠M
...That's why I wanted to let Salieri's music[sr]echo across this patchwork, even as a ghost.
[k]

＠M
I wanted everyone to hear it,[sr]and to see them dancing in delight.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

That's all I ever wanted.

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Reines
Intuition, really. But, if I had to elaborate...
[k]

＠Reines
It's because the music we heard at the masquerade ball reminded you of Antonio Salieri.
[k]


＠Reines
When asked to name a musician Servant,[sr]most people would think of Mozart.
[k]

＠Reines
But in this case, you thought of Salieri, an Avenger.[sr]There must have been a reason for that.
[k]


[charaFace A 5]
＠Reines
That's the whydunit.
[k]

＠Reines
I'd guess you thought the music was incomplete somehow.[sr]And not because Salieri isn't as good as Mozart.
[k]

＠Reines
This isn't about skill, or talent,[sr]or even the performer's particular habits.
[k]

＠Reines
Rather, this is owed to the fact that the music was being played so expertly that it gave you a peek into the performer's soul.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Reines
And what you saw was no doubt incomplete[sr]and unstable...just like Salieri once was.
[k]

＠Reines
From there, once I got the hints about forgetfulness,[sr]ghosts, and Pseudo-Servants, the rest was easy.
[k]

＠Reines
We knew forgetfulness was a big thing here,[sr]thanks to the last patchwork...
[k]

＠Reines
...so it wasn't hard to guess from there that this automaton was a vessel for our pianist, whether it was indeed Salieri or not.
