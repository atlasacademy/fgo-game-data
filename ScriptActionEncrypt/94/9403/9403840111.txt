I assumed you knew your way around a battlefield, but I never thought you would just charge in headfirst.

Surely you could have tried to locate a weak point in the enemy formation, or waited for a better opportunity to strike.

＠Otora
You'd both be dead right now if I hadn't been around, you know.

？2：Basically. By the way, can you tell us where we are?

？！

Oh yes, where are my manners? You must be exhausted. Why not stay in our village today? We'd love to have you, and you'd be right as rain by tomorrow.

At this rate, it'll probably just be a matter of time until my magical energy runs out and I disappear...

I know! Maybe there's a reason that we met, and maybe we could form a temporary contract while we're here?
