＠Reines
I see... So this is the new topography.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Reines
Or perhaps I should say the new[sr]patchwork, to borrow Bunyan's term.

Hmm, looks like our new setting is a masquerade ball.

＠Reines
I'm not sure if it's accurate to call this a Singularity, but it does seem like each area has its own theme.
[k]

＠Reines
First it was a fairy tale, now it's a masquerade ball.[sr]I wonder if there's something tying them together.
[k]

？1：Maybe it has to do with Kintoki, Bunyan, and Nursery Rhyme...

？！

＠Reines
As I recall, there's a fairy[sr]tale about Kintarou in Japan.
[k]

＠Reines
Jack the Ripper is dark even for a fairy tale, but she might have some other connection to keep her here.

Connections are hugely important in the magecraft world. They're the threads we follow to pull the wool over the eyes of the world, after all.

Yes, that's true. I remember being taught about[sr]the importance of connections in magecraft, too.

＠Mash
Oh, by the way, I have one more thing to report.
[k]

＠Mash
For the time being, we've decided to refer[sr]to this Singularity as Patchwork London.

Patchwork London, hm? That's the same thing Bunyan called it. Not bad. It's got a nice ring to it.

＠Mash
On another note, do either of you still[sr]have any issues with your memories?
[k]

？1：I don't think so.
？2：Maybe? It's hard to say.

？！

[charaFace B 12]

＠Mash
It's too bad we can't have a specialist examine you...
[k]

＠Mash
In the meantime, I'll send all the data on your vitals that I can to the medical team. Please let me know if you notice anything else amiss.

Don't worry, we'll keep an eye out.[sr]It's hard to spot holes in your own memory, after all.
[k]

＠Reines
So don't hesitate to let us know[sr]if you see anything off, either.

So I see. I can even sense this one myself.[sr]It's coming from inside that palace...
[k]

＠Reines
...which would be right about where the Tower of London is in the real London. Ugh, as if things weren't bad enough already.

I'm afraid we're putting too much load on the equipment, so I need to stop our transmission for a while. I'm sorry.

＠Mash
It might take some time, but I'll contact you again as soon as I can. Ms. Reines, please watch out for Senpai in the meantime.
