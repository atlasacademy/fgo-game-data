Mini Nobus are embodiments of Nobunaga's subconscious that came about due to a freak Holy Grail accident.
[k]

＠Chief Retainer Mash
It's still not clear how they work, but they've been known to spontaneously reproduce, regenerate, and evolve...
[k]

＠Chief Retainer Mash
...to the point that they can be a pain for most Servants to fight.

＠Chief Retainer Mash
Thus far, Chaldea has been unable to conduct a thorough analysis on them. According to a trusted source:

Come to think of it, how did they even end up with a domain of their own?

[charaFace A 7]

＠Chief Retainer Mash
According to my research, the Mini Nobus used to work for all the other Nobunagas before they set off on their own.
[k]

＠Chief Retainer Mash
Some were dissatisfied with their treatment, some wanted to advance their careers, and some just wanted to watch the world burn...
[k]

＠Chief Retainer Mash
...but whatever their reasons, they eventually assembled in the Kaga Province...
[k]

＠Chief Retainer Mash
...and officially founded a new nation of the Mini Nobus, by Mini Nobus, for the Mini Nobus.
