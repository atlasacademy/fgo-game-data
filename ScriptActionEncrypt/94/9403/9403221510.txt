So this is a Japanese hot springs inn... Feels oddly familiar, though I've never been to one before.[sr]I keep thinking of hanafuda, for some reason.

＠Medusa
I think I'm due for a break from caring for my sisters.[sr]Time to curl up at a charming inn with a good...

I think I could really relax and enjoy myself here.

I do feel guilty coming here without my sisters, but not guilty enough not to stay for a good, long time.

I always wanted to try crocheting some lace flower bouquets for my sisters. This should be the perfect place to try.

I don't know what I would have done if I didn't have any other way of paying for my stay after I found out it would cost more than I expected...

Thank goodness Lady Beni-Enma is so understanding. To let me stay in the inn's attic just in exchange for my skills as a shinobi is simply unbelievable.

If not, I'll go ahead and start your trial right now. Chirp chirp, I hope you're ready to spend at least one hundred years imprisoned.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Kiyohime
No! Please! Anything but Jigoku Kitchen!

And actually, wait! I don't even remember[sr]doing any of that! I swear to the Buddha!

In the meantime, whether you remember doing these things or not, the sparrows clearly saw you there.

＠Tomoe Gozen
I do. I was thinking how we could go[sr]about acquiring dragon's head gems...
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
...and I decided the quickest way to[sr]do so would be from a real live dragon.
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
So I came up with a plan to make[sr]a Shadow Servant out of Kiyohime.
[k]

[charaTalk F]
[charaFace F 1]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]

＠Tomoe Gozen
I am told Shadow Servants appear when the remnants[sr]of a destroyed Heroic Spirit's Spirit Origin...
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
...end up linking to magical energy and grudges in the nearby vicinity instead of dispersing back to the Throne of Heroes.
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
So I thought I could use that phenomenon to essentially clone Kiyohime... Well, only her dark side, actually.
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
Specifically, I thought that if I made a bell tower, had Lord Houzouin, who is monk just like Lord Anchin was, and a beautiful woman stand next to each other there every night...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Tomoe Gozen
...and gathered all of Kiyohime's excess negative aspects, I could “fish” her Shadow Servant out.
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
After all, I knew Kiyohime would never be able to resist becoming a dragon if she saw a handsome man and beautiful woman whispering sweet nothings to each other underneath a great bell.
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
And so, Kiyohime No. 2 was born, just as I had planned.
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
All we need to do now is capture her, defeat her,[sr]and take the gems for ourselves.
[k]

？1：That's...actually pretty ingenious.
？2：I didn't know you were so ruthless.

Still, Tomoe, just because logic and cold-bloodedness served you well in war, that doesn't mean they are the answer to everything.
