Hm, hm, I see... This is a really unusual case.

The whole premise is based on a what-if, and yet its whole purpose for being is consistency.

This is all so mysterious. I've been up working on it for days, and it still never ceases to surprise.

Well, I've been observing a small Singularity for a while now, and I wanted to ask your help in erasing it.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Usually I'd be talking to [%1] about this,[sr]but I thought it might be best to do a bit of groundwork before bringing [&him:her] in.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Dr. Roman
See, this latest case is kind of...unusual.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I had Sheba examine it, and it turns out that this Singularity has sort of a...unique structure.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It's hard to describe, but it kind of looks like it's in the Caribbean, only it also has a bunch of other locations packed into it...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Dr. Roman
It's kind of like this tiny world with models from various time periods all lined up willy-nilly.

These models are all extremely detailed,[sr]but none of them are real.

＠Dr. Roman
This latest Singularity is basically a film world. Well, to be completely fair, it's something of an unfinished work so far as I can tell.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm speculating here, but I think this began when a ghost, probably a director, passed on before he could finish his last movie.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Then this ghost probably happened upon a Holy Grail fragment, and ended up making a Singularity out of his regrets.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So to resolve this one, we need to focus first and foremost on finishing the movie. But the catch is that the whole premise this world is built on is that the movie is unfinished.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
This ghost director can never finish the movie on his own, so eventually, when his wish fails to come true, the Singularity should disappear on its own.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Since this is such a minute Singularity and all,[sr]I estimate that will happen in around three days.

[charaFadein A 0.1 0,-50]

＠Dr. Roman
Well, yes and no. See, when a Singularity disappears on its own, it doesn't leave anything behind.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But, if we resolve what is causing the Singularity and collect the Holy Grail fragments within it, we can get a ton of magical energy.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
And since Chaldea is constantly running low on magical energy, well... This is very hard for me to say, but...

[charaFadein A 0.1 0,-50]

＠Dr. Roman
Well, yes. And preferably as soon as possible,[sr]before it exhausts its magical energy.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Like I said, we know what needs to be done to make this Singularity go away. We just have to finish the movie.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But once again, since this world's premise is that the movie is unfinished, we're going to need help to do that.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The ghost director no longer exists.[sr]All that remains now are this world's systems.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If I had to give it a name, I guess I'd call it “Drifting Cinema Space Hollywood” or something? Just don't tell Edison about it.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Dr. Roman
He's infamous in Hollywood, after all! I wouldn't be surprised if he were drawn and quartered the moment he Rayshifted there!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Dr. Roman
But enough about Edison.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
What I'd like from you is for you to make your way into this alternate Hollywood and make sure the movie gets finished somehow.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
It could be whatever genre you like. The only thing I ask is that you try to make it a good movie if you can.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I'm pretty sure that the better the movie turns out, the more resources we can collect when it's over.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's why I asked you to come here. I figured an author Servant would be the best choice to write and direct the film.

Basically, do take the assignment seriously, but I hope you'll also take some time to relax, you know?

＠Dr. Roman
After all, this is a movie we're talking about. You can't make a masterpiece if the crew isn't enjoying themselves.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Dr. Roman
That said, we don't have much crew of our own to spare for this case...or much in the way of supplies and participants.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
So we need to keep the cast to a minimum, and you need to finish the script ASAP. The Singularity disappears in three days, so you're in for some serious crunch time. Think you can do it?
