Para... A Caster told me that handmade gifts were the best way to convey your feelings...[wait tVoice]

I started by growing cacao beans, and picked them...as carefully as I could...[wait tVoice]

You can touch me without dying.[sr]You can hug me without dying.[wait tVoice]

＠Hassan of the Serenity
[tVoice ValVoice_600900 0_V110]
I think that's why...even if I'm summoned as a Servant in a Holy Grail War...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hassan of the Serenity
[tVoice ValVoice_600900 0_V120]
...I would look for someone who wouldn't die.[wait tVoice]

＠Hassan of the Serenity

This Spirit Origin may not have any record of being summoned outside my hollow memories of the Sixth Singularity...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hassan of the Serenity
[tVoice ValVoice_600900 0_V140]
...but even so, I'm sure I would look for someone like that.[wait tVoice]

？1：It's okay.
？2：I won't die if you touch me.

＠Hassan of the Serenity

Yes.[sr]Thank you.[wait tVoice]

＠Hassan of the Serenity
[tVoice ValVoice_600900 0_V160]
But...I'm sorry. I'm so...so sorry.[sr]I...[wait tVoice]

I used my bare hands, of all things, to make this chocolate. These very hands, from start to finish.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hassan of the Serenity
[tVoice ValVoice_600900 0_V180]
I meant to make it with lots of love... To convey my gratitude for touching me without dying.[wait tVoice]

＠Hassan of the Serenity
[tVoice ValVoice_600900 0_V190]
But... But... But...![sr]I also ended up making it with lots of poison![wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaChange A 6009002 4 fade 0.6]

＠Hassan of the Serenity
[tVoice ValVoice_600900 0_V200]
It's a hundred times more poisonous than my touch, and several times greater than membrane contact...more than enough to be fatal.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hassan of the Serenity
[tVoice ValVoice_600900 0_V210]
No human could eat it and survive.[sr]I'm sure it would even kill a Heroic Spirit.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hassan of the Serenity
[tVoice ValVoice_600900 0_V220]
I guess if someone resistant to poison ate it, they might be okay...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Hassan of the Serenity
[tVoice ValVoice_600900 0_V230]
...but they also might not be.[sr]So[line 2][wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：I'll be fine!
？2：They already proved poison doesn't affect me!

E-even though this chocolate is...full of my poison...?[wait tVoice]
