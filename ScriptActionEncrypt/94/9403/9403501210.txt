Yes, I'm sure she is.[sr]I've heard she can be quite a handful.

Of course, I suppose she had to be to properly support the Toyotomi clan after they lost Lord Hideyoshi.

Really! My father was a retainer for Akechi, who killed Lord Nobunaga, and my husband was a retainer for Kobayakawa, who betrayed the Toyotomi clan.

I'm sure they must see me as this horrible woman who was part of all the worst things in their lives.
