What was that? You, want to give me, a gift?[wait tVoice]

＠Gilgamesh
[tVoice ValVoice_501800 0_V020]
...You certainly are a fearless one, aren't you. To think you would make a move before I could bestow my gift upon you.[wait tVoice]

Well, no matter. I will accept that impertinence of yours as one of your positive traits. You are, after all, the idiot who made [&his:her] way through that gauntlet on sheer guts alone.[wait tVoice]

So? Where is this gift of yours? Hurry and hand it over. Do not keep me waiting.[wait tVoice]

Is this Valentine's Day chocolate?[wait tVoice]

Wha...! You fool! Who do you think I am!?[wait tVoice]

＠Gilgamesh
[tVoice ValVoice_501800 0_V090]
I may be slumming it right now, but I am still the king of Uruk! Master of all luxuries, and owner of all wealth under the sun![wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_501800 0_V100]
...Well, not including the part of my treasury that Ishtar has claimed dominion over that I have written off as necessary expense.[wait tVoice]

You should be ashamed of yourself, gifting me a paltry offering such as this! I should send you back into Kur to reflect on your crime![wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Dammit, I thought an amateurish handmade gift might not cut it...!
？2：If only Chaldea had a luxury brand shop...!

？！

Don't be a fool. I speak of quantity, not quality! This measly thing will barely last me two bites![wait tVoice]

Our feast would be over in but a moment! Were you planning to share a table with me for no more than a few minutes!?[wait tVoice]

[tVoice ValVoice_501800 0_V140]
...Heh. Pitiful. But, I suppose this IS the best a Master of such lowly origins as yours could muster.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
[tVoice ValVoice_501800 0_V150]
Very well, you leave me no choice. Just this once, I will show you what a true Valentine's celebration entails.[wait tVoice]

Follow me, [%1]. I will teach you about the true essence of my treasured Uruk personally.[wait tVoice]
