Oh, no, it was nothing...[sr]Dealing with ghosts is my job, after all.

＠Reines
Gray's family runs an unusual cemetery, even by British standards. She's been trained to be its grave keeper.
[k]

＠Reines
That basically makes her a pro when it comes to dealing with ghosts. Not that she'll be taking over the family business anytime soon, of course.

All that aside...those were some awfully odd ghosts.

They tasted a little odd, too! Kind of like they had a bunch of mismatched flavors mixed in? Don't get me wrong, they were still yummy and all, but sometimes it felt like I was eating a bunch of mist or something!

Hmm. Hey, pupil.[sr]Do you know exactly what dead spirits are?
[k]

？1：Are they...not dead people?
？2：Aren't they just people that became ghosts?

？！

＠Reines
Well, yes, but you're only half right. In magecraft, certain types of dead spirits are considered to be memories.
[k]

？1：Dead spirits are memories?
？2：How does that work?

？！

It's just what it sounds like. They're memories that have begun acting of their own accord.

＠Reines
I knew you'd get it, Gray.[sr]Basically, you can think of them as corrupt data.
[k]

＠Reines
Dead spirits don't have anything in the way of true intelligence, and of course, they don't have souls. All they do is repeat things they did when they were alive, without any rhyme or reason.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Reines
They're nothing more than remnants of past events that have been burned into particular places or objects.
[k]

＠Reines
And it looks like these steam ghosts are beings of pure magecraft that have been created by mixing in memories of that sort.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Reines
...But why would beings like that be running[sr]around the catacombs of Steam Castle?

True, that could well be the case here.[sr]If we bump into any of those, at least we'll be expecting it.
