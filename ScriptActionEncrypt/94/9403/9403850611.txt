So what you're saying is that she did nothing wrong. Shoulda known Oni Musashi might pull a stunt like this.

It's been kind of a nightmare, let me tell you. First I wake up in Hokkaido this morning, then I realize my family name is now Kakizaki for some reason...

＠Kakizaki Sitonai
And that's not even getting into how hard it was just to make the trip here to Echigo!

I don't know what I would have done if Shirou and Berserker hadn't been here with me...

Well, now that you've reached the Chaldea clan's territory, you're welcome to stay and recuperate for as long as you like.

Although, I'm curious:[sr]Why did you come to Echigo in the first place?

＠Kakizaki Sitonai
Oh, that's because I found a[sr]mysterious map back in Hokkaido...
[k]

＠Kakizaki Sitonai
...that said there's a vast amount of gold sleeping on an island not too far from here.
[k]

[charaFace C 11]

＠Kakizaki Sitonai
I thought that gold might have something to do with how I ended up here, so I came to see for myself.
