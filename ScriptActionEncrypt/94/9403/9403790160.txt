？1：Who are you?
？！

＠Book
There is no point asking me who I am...since this world will soon be mine.
[k]

＠Book
I am the shadow conceived by this world,[sr]and I am the true representative of this world.

I designed a perfectly balanced and harmonious world. Once you submit to me and your world is conformed to my text...
[k]

＠Book
...a union of potent love will allow[sr]us all to gain unlimited power!
[k]

＠Book
No evil that threatens this[sr]world will stand a chance!
[k]

＠Book
Barbarism in all its forms will cease to be, and an everlasting spring of only joyous, heartwarming days will begin!
[k]

＠Book
Now come, join us at the end of “happily ever after” and spend your days in giggling merriment.
[k]

？1：Brainwashing is bad, though.
？！

＠Book
It was necessary to bring[sr]us closer to my ideal world.
[k]

＠Book
And everyone will be paired up as I deem fit.
[k]

＠Book
Elisabeth shall be with Kiyohime.[sr]Jeanne shall flirt with Marie.
[k]

＠Book
Martha and Marie shall share their love for each other. Altera shall marry Madam Blavatsky.
[k]

＠Book
My ships are the best ships. The ONLY ships.[sr]No other unions may occur. EVER!
[k]

？1：Isn't that cruel?

This is a farce. It's fine to ignore the original setting or break down the characters.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
There's nothing wrong with secondary creations having Kiyohime get together with someone other than Master.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But not everyone is going to accept that.[sr]You can't just ignore reality.
[k]

？1：One person's turn-ons are another person's turnoffs!
？2：I'm sinking your ships!
？！

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
Yes, thank you![sr]That's perfect!
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Da Vinci
Your fantasy is just that: a fantasy![sr]You can't just force it on everyone else.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And trying to overwrite our “official” reality with your fantasy is the height of selfishness!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Reality is reality, and there's no room for fantasy to butt in!
[k]

？1：Then again, official content can be kind of triggering sometimes...
？！

＠Da Vinci
This is getting complicated, so just stop.[sr]Besides, I'm speaking generally here.
