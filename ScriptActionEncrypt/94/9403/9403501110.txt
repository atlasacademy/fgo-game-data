＠Goredolf
Nnn... Just how big is this labyrinth, anyway? I'm bored of Gof Punching enemies to smithereens by now!
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Goredolf
Then again, I suppose that sort of boredom is inevitable when you're just overwhelmingly powerful like me. Hehehe. The only thing more criminal than my sheer talent is how long it took me to realize it...

Y-y-y-yes, of course. I'm a busy man, after all, seeing how I'm responsible for the many people working under me.

＠Goredolf
I would be happy to regale you with as many tales[sr]of my hardships and exploits as you like.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Goredolf
Now, where to begin... Perhaps I should start with the one about my technical advisor.
[k]

＠Goredolf
She's a hard worker[line 2]too hard, if you ask me[line 2]so one time, I came up with a new spell that would have the barbecue industry quaking in its boots in order to surprise her, only to have her burst out laughing before she praised me.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Goredolf
And then there was the time my administrative advisor spouted off some famous quote out of nowhere, so I scolded him to be more mindful of the time and place for that sort of thing!
[k]

＠Goredolf
After all, there are few things worse than realizing after the fact which case of his he was quoting from while you're in the loo!

Haha, now, now, settle down. First, I'd like you to show me the way to this paradise you mentioned. Do be careful not to get lost.

(Heh. I almost feel bad for these dolls, seeing how helpless they are in the face of my negotiation skills.)

(Hehe, I must say, having them believe me so fully feels rather good. Yes, rather good indeed...)
