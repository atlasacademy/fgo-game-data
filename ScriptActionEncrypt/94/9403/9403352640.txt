...Well?[wait tVoice]

？1：I thought I was a dead [&man:woman].

？！

Good. If you had said one word starting with “beau” upon seeing this chocolate, your life would have been forfeit.[wait tVoice]

Of course, that is why I chose to shape them like this.[wait tVoice]

...You are not him, and I know you would never say beau...the “B” word.[wait tVoice]

＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]
[tVoice ValVoice_702700 0_V070]
In that regard, I will admit that you are a good Master.[wait tVoice]

＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]

Which is why I am giving you this chocolate as a token of that esteem, or perhaps, a mark of trust...[wait tVoice]

Ahem. Furthermore, giving a gift of mere food is far too soft for our liking.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 2]

[tVoice ValVoice_702700 0_V100]
So I made this sturdy enough to be used for training. You should at least be capable of slaying a Demonic Boar with it! Probably![wait tVoice]

？1：(Pretty sure that's not happening!)

You will live in these mountains, and devote yourself to training until your abdominals are as visible as mine. If you get hungry, you can eat your new weapon.[wait tVoice]

That is all I have to say about this gift. I look forward to seeing you become a great warrior.[wait tVoice]

If you work hard enough, it may even not be too late for you to earn yourself a place as my right-hand [&man:woman].[wait tVoice]
