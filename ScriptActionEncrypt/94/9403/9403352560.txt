This is completely unacceptable behavior for one of Lord Toyotomi's favorite retainers! It will take more than a few lost lands to make up for this outrageous lack of deference![wait tVoice]

Heh. Boring old chocolate isn't enough to satiate Chacha's discerning palate, so Chacha went with sweet red beans instead.[wait tVoice]

But Chacha will never, ever tell you that the main reason Chacha went with Chacha's favorite red bean soup instead of chocolate was because Chacha planned to join you.[wait tVoice]

？1：...Thank you.

You know how it is! Chacha figured there was no way you'd be getting chocolate from anyone else and felt sorry for you. It's kind of like getting chocolate from your mother![wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Chacha
[tVoice ValVoice_702600 0_V180]
Think of it like really fancy courtesy chocolate![wait tVoice]

Good, good! Of course, Chacha did go out of her way to make this for you, so it's only natural you'd think that![wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Chacha

Oh, and just to be extra clear, this is only courtesy bean soup! Chacha will say it again: it's like getting chocolate from your mother.[wait tVoice]
