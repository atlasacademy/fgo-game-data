I thought if Saint Nicholas wasn't going to be teaching children right from wrong, it would fall to me instead.

I've noticed that, lately, people have been asking me why I'm carrying a cross, like they have forgotten that I am a saint at all...

That's right. I sort of forcefully entered the prelims with Tarasque as my partner, but unfortunately, I failed to qualify.

What rotten luck. How could I have known a puppy would try to cross the tracks during the Train Attack event!?

Well, I couldn't just let him get run over, could I? What self-respecting saint could!? I had no choice but to stop the train in its tracks!
