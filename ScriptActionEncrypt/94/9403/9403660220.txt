I'll say this for whoever handled[sr]the design: their taste is golden.

Wooow, there's so many paintings and things in here![sr]Some things are all curved, some are all straight... They're just like guts!
[k]

？1：It really is all about guts with you, isn't it...

＠Reines
This place might not be like the real London, but I'd still bet it covers about half of the British Museum.
[k]

＠Reines
I could easily spend a week here and it wouldn't be enough. All right, let's be quick and efficient about canvasing the place and taking out any intruders.

＠Reines
Now I see. I've heard of you before,[sr]though we usually call you Ghost Liners.
[k]

？1：Ghost Liners?
？2：What are those?

？！

[charaFace C 1]

＠Reines
In this case, I'd say they're Heroic Spirits that have made their mark on history. Just think of them as great figures and heroes of ages past.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Reines
But of course, in a case involving mages and Mystics,[sr]the usual intrepid explorer approach won't cut it.
[k]

＠Reines
Magecraft and Mystics might adhere to a set of rules,[sr]but when you get right down to it, all bets are off.
[k]

＠Reines
The power of flight? Walking through walls? Playing God and making new humans out of nothing? All within the realm of possibility.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Reines
And if that weren't bad enough, even basic rules are different depending on which magical lineage you're dealing with, so standard investigative procedures will amount to absolutely nothing in a case like this.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Reines
That's why these kinds of cases aren't about the whodunit or the howdunit, since both of those can be fudged to hell and back.
[k]

＠Reines
No, what we need to figure out is the whydunit.
[k]

？1：The whydunit?

＠Reines
It's a subgenre of murder mystery where[sr]the culprit's motive plays a crucial role.
[k]

？2：Like in a murder mystery.

＠Reines
Exactly. They're subgenres. As you can probably guess, whodunits focus on the culprit's identity, howdunits on the tricks employed, and whydunits on the motive.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 4]

＠Reines
My brother used to say that sort of thing all the time... How bitterly ironic that he'd end up the victim of one such mystery himself.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Reines
We might be up against a mage, but they're still human at heart. If anything, their motive is bound to be an even greater fixation for them.
[k]

＠Reines
After all, you can't be a mage unless you're willing[sr]to give up everything else in your life for magecraft.
[k]

＠Reines
So without all that excess holding you back, your motive can't help but become pure as the proverbial driven snow.
[k]

＠Reines
It's a lot like being a Servant in a way. No matter how great or powerful they might be, they're still dead spirits engraved on the Throne of Heroes.
[k]

＠Reines
As a result, they can't help but be true to themselves. Whatever their nature[line 2]good, evil, honest, deceitful[line 2]it's still one-hundred-percent pure.
[k]

？1：Completely pure in nature...
？2：So even evil people can be pure...

？！

[charaFace C 1]

＠Reines
So to tie it all together, it doesn't matter[sr]who went missing, or how they went missing.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Reines
What matters is WHY they went missing.

Don't worry, it's a lot simpler than it might sound.[sr]For now, let's just keep looking around the museum.
