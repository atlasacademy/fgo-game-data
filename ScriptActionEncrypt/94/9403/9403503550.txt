I would have cut Kama down from behind, but it did not seem as though that would kill her.

So my only choice was to have Lord Tenkai help[sr]me provide a less direct form of assistance...[sr][wt 0.6](C[charaFace G 3][messageShake 0.02 3 3 0.6]ough! Cough, hack)...!

“A less direct form of assistance”... Those hanafuda cards gave off identical readings to the Ooku. Like they made up part of the Ooku.
[k]

＠Sion
And this Ooku is made from the[sr]energy of human bodies and souls.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Sion
In which case...it would not be at all surprising if those hanafuda cards were made from someone's body.

I, Matsudaira Izu-no-Kami Nobutsuna...am the man who utterly robbed the Tokugawa family of their reputation and significance.

My actions to date should prove as much. In order to protect the Tokugawa, I completely betrayed their trust in me...

So these hanafuda cards are made up of the same energy used to construct Ooku, and they are part of your body.
[k]

＠Sion
And now, they have taken on a whole new meaning.
[k]

＠Sion
Shogun Yoshinobu's pillbox contains outward-facing power, but these cards contain inward-facing power.
[k]

[charaFace C 12]

Which means...they can be used to neutralize[sr][%1]'s Tokugawafication!
