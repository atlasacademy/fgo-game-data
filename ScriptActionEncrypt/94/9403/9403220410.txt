＠A：???
Hmm. Here I thought I would step out and loosen my sword arm about a familiar mountain, only to find myself at a hot springs inn instead.
[k]

＠A：???
I must have crossed a certain boundary without realizing. But which bond called to me?
[k]

＠A：???
No doubt I will be unable to return should I cross this bridge, but then, it is not every day one has the chance to be spirited away.
[k]

＠A：???
Whichever way this turns...it should[sr]make for a good drinking story.

[%1]! Cheep cheep, you fixed[sr]up that guest room to make it usable!?

[charaFace B 7]

＠Beni-Enma
Chirp... Tamamo did tell me you would be doing some large-scale renovations, but I'm still surprised at how fast you work...
[k]

？2：I'm sorry I repaired it without asking permission...

[charaFace B 1]

＠Beni-Enma
Oh no, no need to apologize, chirp.[sr]I'm just surprised at how fast you work.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

My sparrows and I could never find the[sr]time to get to it, so I'm grateful!

？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠Beni-Enma
I guess I'll have to reconsider the[sr]way we do some things around here.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
After all, the more rooms we have available,[sr]the more guests will show up.

Is something wrong, sir?[sr]Actually, may I ask which god you might be?

＠Beni-Enma
...Hmm. I can tell from your face[sr]that you've seen a lot of bloodshed.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I have no intention of being judgmental,[sr]but it's also my job to keep all my other guests safe.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Honored traveler, this is a place of healing and hot springs. If you mean to purify yourself, chirp, I suggest you try another inn.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Kojirou
I assure you, madam, you have me wrong.[sr]I killed not a single person in life.
[k]

＠Kojirou
I am simply a humble mountain dweller who[sr]ended up as a Servant purely by mistake.
[k]

＠Kojirou
I have no intention of causing a disturbance, nor am[sr]I beset by would-be rivals seeking a challenge.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Kojirou
I merely happened upon this inn by chance...or perhaps by a stroke of karma.
[k]

＠Kojirou
At any rate, I am quite taken with this solitary atmosphere. Might you have a room available?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Beni-Enma
A Servant, chirp... Does that mean you're a Heroic Spirit familiar, like the ones [%1] mentioned?
[k]

＠Kojirou
Indeed I am. Hm?[sr]Madam, did you just say “[%1]”?

I see. So it was not my bond to an inn[sr]that led me here, but my bond to a human.
[k]

＠Kojirou
You must tell me how this came to be another time. Madam, would you be so kind as to show me to my room?
[k]

＠Kojirou
I would rather my acquaintances not see me while I am exhausted. I must first rid myself of the grime accumulated on my journey. Hahaha.

...There's something suspicious about that man.[sr]You say you know him?
[k]

＠Mash
Yes, we do. His name is Kojirou. And the fact[sr]that he knows us must mean he's the one from Chaldea.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
I see... I can't put my feather on it, but there's something about him that irks me...
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Wandering samurai like him or Ms. Musashi[sr]always smell like trouble.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]

...Huh?

[charaFace B 10]

＠Beni-Enma
Though I suppose you could say she's[sr]still lingering around in one sense...
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

Anyway, pay it no mind, chirp. I'm willing to[sr]let that suspicious-looking samurai stay here.

＠Beni-Enma
I already promised Tamamo and the others[sr]that I wouldn't interfere with your work.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Beni-Enma
Besides, all the cleaning you've[sr]been doing has been a big help.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
So go ahead and do whatever it is you need to do.
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
As long as you conduct yourselves properly,[sr]I'm sure Lord Enma won't mind.

This is great, Senpai. Now we have official[sr]approval to renovate the Enma-tei.

If we keep improving it at this rate, I'm sure we'll be able to gather enough gratitude in no time!
