＠Sion
As a mage from the Atlas Institute, I am ashamed to say this but there is still a lot I do not know about this Tokugawafication.
[k]

＠Sion
The fact is, it is a completely new concept, so we still do not have an accurate way of measuring it.
[k]

＠Sion
So I cannot deny that there is a possibility that these shogun pillboxes may induce unforeseen side effects.
[k]

[charaFace E 11]

＠Sion
According to Kama, Tokugawafication is due to the corruption that occurs as a result of making one's way through this labyrinth...
[k]

＠Sion
...but that does not necessarily mean that is the only way it can happen...
[k]

[charaFace E 14]

＠Sion
To be clear, I am not saying this to worry you.
[k]

＠Sion
I just thought I should let you know that I cannot absolutely guarantee that this pillbox is safe.
[k]

？1：We don't have time to fret about it.
？2：If this is our only way of fighting back, we have to take that chance.
？！

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_70 1.0]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Sion
Yes, you are right.[sr]In the end, this is our only option.
[k]

＠Sion
I do get the sense that our choices have been narrowed down artificially, but still, the Ooku is the enemy's territory[line 2]or rather, the enemy herself.
[k]

＠Sion
It only makes sense that the odds would be stacked against us. We will just have to focus on doing what we can at this point in time.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]

＠Sion
So on that note, let's go ahead and add this new pillbox to your Mystic Code!
[k]

＠Sion
And do not worry. This will not harm the soul of the shogun inside, just like it did not hurt the other souls!

[charaFace E 5]

＠Sion
All we can really do with that pillbox at this point is reuse what is inside it for our own purposes.
[k]

[charaFace E 11]

＠Sion
And since it is better suited for outward-facing uses,[sr]I think that using it defensively...
[k]

[charaFace E 14]

＠Sion
...namely, a barrier that can keep Kama from exerting her influence any further, is our best bet.
[k]

＠Sion
Think of it as a way to stop her from flipping the switch that makes things worse.
[k]

[charaFace E 12]

＠Sion
Oh, and I think we should also be able to condense[sr]it into a projectile attack, like Gandr.
