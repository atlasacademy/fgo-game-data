Oh? What brings you here, Master? It is still rather early for dinner, is it not?[wait tVoice]

Or perhaps it is nap time, and you came here to sleep amongst the fragrant bamboo?[wait tVoice]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V040]
If you have, I would be happy to take a break and join you.[wait tVoice]

[f large]So sweet!!![wait tVoice]

N-nnngh! Are all modern-day sweets this sweet!?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V120]
This is nothing like the sweet and sour taste of fruit. It is more like taking a blow from a greatsword![wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V130]
...Then again, this has its own charm! As in all things, there is a time for a light touch, and a time for blunt force.[wait tVoice]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V140]
...But now, I must find a way to return the favor. And it cannot be just any old thank-you gift.[wait tVoice]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V150]
Very well, I will give it some thought, and find a gift suitable for your current situation![wait tVoice]

Please go on back ahead of me, Master. I won't be long![wait tVoice]

Hello there, Master! Thank you for waiting! I know there is still some time to go before dinner, but are you hungry?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：I was just thinking of going to the cafeteria...

[charaFace A 1]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V180]
Oho. Then this works out nicely.[wait tVoice]

That's right. A vegetarian meal.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V220]
Chocolate is an intensive food. I am certain it is hard to digest.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V230]
So I decided to try making you a meal that would be gentle on your stomach and warm you up during these wintry days.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：You made this yourself, Inshun!?
？！

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V240]
I did. I may not be as skilled as the cooks in a Buddhist temple, but good food nourishes the soul as well as the body.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V250]
Which is why I did my best to learn how to make all sorts of things when I was alive![wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 4]

[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V260]
...Unfortunately, that was a long time ago, and my skills have grown rusty.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V270]
No, if anything, all my spear practice has only made my cooking skills a far cry from what they used to be![wait tVoice]
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V280]
Regardless of the reason, I could never in good conscience serve what I had made to you as it was.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V290]
So I asked the Servants proficient in cooking for help with the finer seasonings.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V300]
While those other Servants did end up tasting this before you...I can still vouch that it turned out far and away the best.[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Wow, thanks...!
？！

＠Inshun
[tVoice ValVoice_301400 0_V310]
Not at all! Now then, let us put our hands together and say...[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Thank you for this meal!
