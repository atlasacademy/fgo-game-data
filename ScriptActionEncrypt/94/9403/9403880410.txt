＠Date Jeanne Alter
Khh! My sealed off right eye[sr]is reacting, pulsing with power!

＠Date Jeanne Alter
Get back! If the restraints on my dark power fail, it could plunge the entire Warring States into an era of endless darkness!

？1：I, uh, think you dropped your eyepatch.

？2：Is that the plot of your next doujin or something?

＠Date Jeanne Alter
Oh shut your damn mouth! You think I wanted to get summoned to whatever this crap is? I have a deadline to meet, and it's TOMORROW!

＠Date Jeanne Alter
My printer refused to give me another extension too! Why'd they have to hold another weird event now, of all times!?

Although... You say this Date guy's nickname was the One-Eyed Dragon? That's pretty badass.

If you like his nickname, I'd say the Dragon of Echigo is right up there in terms of, um, badass...ness?

Puh-leeze. A one-eyed dragon is way more badass than some boring old Echigo dragon.
[k]

＠Date Jeanne Alter
And throwing in three katana on top of it? That's like plus twenty badass points. PEAK BADASSERY!

Did I mention that, in addition to the Dragon of Echigo, I'm also a god of war and the avatar of Bishamonten, complete with all eight of his one-of-a-kind blades?
