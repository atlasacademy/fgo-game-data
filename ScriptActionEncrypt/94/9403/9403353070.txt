Valentine's is a lot of fun, isn't it? Two lovers lost in thought for one another... Giving each other gifts... Smiling together...[wait tVoice]

Hugging...[sr]Kissing...[wait tVoice]

I've been keeping more to myself since about a week before Valentine's... I stopped going after Cú...[wait tVoice]

Once they start thinking things like that, they're as good as mine! In fact, this past week, Fergus has been asking me if I'm okay![wait tVoice]

＠Medb

At some point, I even lost track of how many times he asked! Fionn mac Cumhaill asked me too, though I couldn't care less about him![wait tVoice]
