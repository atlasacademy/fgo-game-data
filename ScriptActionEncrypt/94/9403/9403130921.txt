Why are you doing this? Even if you win,[sr]you would never become the true Santa Claus.

That's true. But as long as this whole ordeal ends and I get my power back, that's good enough.
[k]

＠Bradamante
Really, when you stop and think about it, it's awful that all this snow has fallen in Mexico. Christmas or not, there must be so many people who've had their lives disrupted by all this.

I will be happy if I can just go back[sr]to being a regular Santa Claus, yes.

I have no interest in becoming the “true Santa” and keeping Christmas going forever, no.

The true Santa Claus's eternal Christmas would be paradise on Earth. You might even encounter the one you seek there.

That's easy. It wouldn't be real.

＠Bradamante
Besides...I meant what I said about how[sr]I didn't want to be spoiled with gifts.
[k]

＠Bradamante
I know I have my weaknesses, and if someone started spoiling me, I'd end up wholly dependent on them.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Bradamante
I'm drawn to the idea of paradise, too! But I can't go around chasing illusions just because they seem like they'd be nice.

That sort of thing has happened way too many times before...so I decided not to let it happen again.
