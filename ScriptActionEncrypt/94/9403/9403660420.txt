？1：Luvia?

Her body is, anyway. Looks like she's a Pseudo-Servant like me. Though apparently they chose to fuse their personalities rather than keep them separate.

＠Reines
Hmph. I guess that makes sense though, since she is a Pseudo-Servant. A really powerful one, too, if this spiritual force is anything to go by... This is no ordinary Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Reines
Why did Luvia have to get a Divine Spirit, dammit![sr]There's no way we could beat her in a fair fight!
[k]

？1：Couldn't your Noble Phantasm help us?

＠Reines
No, it couldn't. All my Noble Phantasm can[sr]do is remove advantages and expose weaknesses.
[k]

＠Reines
It works great against one-trick ponies,[sr]but doesn't do squat against jack-of-all-trades types.
[k]


＠Reines
And that Pseudo-Servant is definitely the latter.[sr]Her stats are quite high across the board.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Reines
If Trimmau's analysis is anything to go by,[sr]her stats have all got to be B or better!
[k]

？2：If we work together[line 2]


＠Reines
Don't forget that Assassin. He's bound to stop[sr]you from using your summoning spells again.
[k]

＠Reines
What's more, that Pseudo-Servant Luvia's become[sr]has pretty outstanding stats across the board.
[k]

＠Reines
If Trimmau's analysis is anything to go by,[sr]her stats have all got to be B or better!

？！


[charaFace A 5]

＠Reines
And if that wasn't bad enough, we don't even know what her Noble Phantasm is like. It's much too risky.

I don't know what sort of relationship[sr]you and this body's owner have...

...but if you insist on continuing to seek Mnemosyne,[sr]I'll have to pass judgment upon you.

Senpai! Are you all right!?

？！

Yes, but we can still only maintain[sr]the connection for a short time.

＠Mash
We're working on extending it, but when I noticed your readings indicated you were in combat, I had to make sure you were okay...

It does sound very likely that this pianist has some connection to the Mnemosyne paper you found earlier.
[k]

？1：Do you think it might be this Singularity's Holy Grail?

？！

＠Mash
Yes, I do. I can only venture a guess at this point, but based on what we know, it seems extremely unlikely that it would be completely unrelated.

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Reines
The same thing you do in any investigation:[sr]interrogate the suspects.
