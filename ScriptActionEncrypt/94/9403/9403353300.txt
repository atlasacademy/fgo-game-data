Right, right. This is part of that Valentine's Day celebration! This explains why we've both had so much on our plates lately, Maître![wait tVoice]

This goes back to something Saint Valentinus did,[sr]right? Nice change of pace.[wait tVoice]

And I think in your country, they celebrate this by giving out chocolat, right?[wait tVoice]

You know, this works out nicely. It might be a little lacking as a return gift, but I've got something for you, too.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Napoleon
[tVoice ValVoice_203100 0_V070]
I was planning on having you taste this for me sooner or later anyway, so why not now?[wait tVoice]
[k]

？1：Huh? Now I'm curious...
？2：You're giving me chocolate too, Napoleon?

？！

[charaFace A 11]
＠Napoleon
[tVoice ValVoice_203100 0_V080]
No, it's not chocolat.[sr]But it is something valuable and meaningful.[wait tVoice]

I wouldn't go so far as to call this one of my regrets, but hey, you know how there are so many good cooks among Chaldea's Servants?[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Napoleon
[tVoice ValVoice_203100 0_V100]
It doesn't take much to get them going, either. I just mentioned offhandedly that I was thinking about this...[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Napoleon
[tVoice ValVoice_203100 0_V110]
...and they all busted their asses to make it.[sr]So, strictly speaking, I didn't make this myself.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Napoleon
[tVoice ValVoice_203100 0_V120]
I can only claim credit as a producteur.[sr]So if you like it, be sure to thank them, not me.[wait tVoice]

I know Servants don't need things like this,[sr]but I wanted to try my hand at them anyway.[wait tVoice]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Napoleon
[tVoice ValVoice_203100 0_V180]
And like I said, I had the kitchen Servants help make them, so I guarantee they taste as good as they look.[wait tVoice]
[k]

＠Napoleon
[tVoice ValVoice_203100 0_V190]
I also had Sir Babbage and Edison to help me with the cans...[wait tVoice]

...and both Paracelsus and Nightingale gave them their hygienic seal of approval. They've all been heat sterilized, pasteurized, you name it![wait tVoice]

The more I talk, the more I realize I didn't do a damn thing to make them myself...but I'd still love for you to try them.[wait tVoice]

Oh, right. If you can, I was hoping you would eat them with Mash, too. A couple of growing kids like you need all the nutrients you can get![wait tVoice]
