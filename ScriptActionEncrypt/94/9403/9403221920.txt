＠Beni-Enma
Is this all to take revenge for what happened to[sr]you in The Quarrel of the Monkey and the Crab?
[k]

＠Beni-Enma
Is it because you kept getting pigeonholed as a bad guy even though you were just trying to live your life?

Because it's fun, of course! There's nothing better than tricking a bunch of happy-go-lucky simpletons!

Except maybe for watching a bunch of weak little shits work themselves to death for nothing!
