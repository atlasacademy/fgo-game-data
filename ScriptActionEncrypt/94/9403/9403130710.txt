I asked her if she was serious too, Mash...

＠E：Quetzal Mask?
But she just looked me right in the eye and said I was the only one who could do this.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠E：Quetzal Mask?
How could I say no to that? So I decided to set aside our religious differences and accept.
[k]

＠E：Quetzal Mask?
As her friend, a Heroic Spirit, and a fellow woman warrior, I felt it was the least I could do.
[k]

＠E：Quetzal Mask?
And, truly, the thought of having to forfeit because of something so vile and underhanded galls me!
[k]

＠E：Quetzal Mask?
It would mean all the work I've done[sr]as a coach would be for naught!
[k]

＠E：Quetzal Mask?
So I figured cutting loose and engaging in a bit of mild shenanigans would at least be better than doing nothing.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠E：Quetzal Mask?
Heh... I guess Bradamante's tenacity[sr]must have rubbed off on me.

＠E：Quetzal Mask?
Don't worry. No one else will figure out[sr]who I am as long as I keep this mask on!

Quetzalcoatl was adamant that masks provide A-rank Noble Phantasm-level Identity Concealment in a lucha match!
