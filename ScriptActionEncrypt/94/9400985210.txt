＠El-Melloi
...Chocolate, huh? That's right, today is Valentine's Day.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
I know that in Japan, the popular custom is for women to gift chocolates to men.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Admittedly, in recent times that has begun to change. But that's what happens over time.

＠El-Melloi
Hm? How is it where I'm from?

＠El-Melloi
In England, it is less about a specific role for females or males. One gifts chocolates to his or her loved ones. That is all.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
The custom of gifting chocolates actually originated in England.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
In England, in addition to chocolates, one might give wine, flowers, or champagne.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
And you mustn't forget to include an unsigned greeting card.
[k]

？1：You send it anonymously?

[charaFace A 1]

＠El-Melloi
Exactly.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
One does not deliver gifts oneself, so as to conceal the sender.
[k]

？2：What kind of greetings are written on it?

[charaFace A 1]

＠El-Melloi
Oh, just typical words of love.[sr]Things like, “Please be mine.”
[k]

＠El-Melloi
It's straightforward, but those are strong words.[sr]Not much to misinterpret there.
[k]

？！

＠El-Melloi
...Understandably, this is a custom that should only be conducted by good, honest people.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Accepting an anonymous gift from a mage is no better than smoking next to a gasoline pump.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Should you receive such a gift, throw it away without a second thought.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠El-Melloi
I shall accept your chocolates. There is no better food for the mind after it has been exercised.
[k]
