Yes. We've already run out of the meager amount of grains we brought from Chaldea.

Whoa, one more word and I'm taking that as sacrilege against rice! To us Japanese Heroic Spirits, rice is supreme! Rice is love itself!

Senpai, how can I put this? Our group is divided along the lines of the world's three major grains.

＠Mash
All of them grow in abundance and are tasty, so it's hard to say which is best. Please make your decision, Master!
