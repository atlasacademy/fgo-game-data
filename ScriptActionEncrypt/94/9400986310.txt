Why hello there. Nice weather we are having here.[sr]Luck must be on your side today.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
If you're going to take a walk through Chaldea or the simulator, I shall accompany you. Fortunately, I am in no hurry.
[k]

？1：Good timing.
？2：Truly, what luck.

Oh, I was just being polite. You take this way more seriously than I thought, huh?

...My apologies. Let's start over again. Please state your business. I shall listen with open ears.

I have forgotten about this important day.[sr]Thank you very much. I shall respectfully accept.

This is so much. I may not be able to eat it all.

So, may I hand them out to others? Like when Nursery Rhyme or Jack come eyeing them.
[k]

？1：Of course!

[charaFace A 4]

...You answered without the slightest hesitation.[sr]It was thoughtless of me to try to tease you...

[charaFace A 0]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
But that is truly what my Master should be: a generous individual. Now I must think of a gift in return.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
This is not because a proper gentleman's etiquette calls for it, but rather it is plainly the duty of a king.
[k]

Now then... Hmmm...

Yes. It is a wonderfully entertaining water park located in some city. The park is called Waku Waku Zabuun.

You have completed your long task, so why don't you come take a break with us Servants.

Yes, the more women in swimsuits, the better.[sr]Surely, that is a wondrous luxury.

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
These Servants gathered here are my gift to you. Of course, you could come up with various combinations...
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
Perhaps, instead of the pure and innocent, you'd prefer the mysterious, exotic beauties. Maybe the grandiose Servants instead.

Your tastes are generally the opposite of mine.[sr]I know everyone likes different things.

What other combinations have you thought of, Master?
