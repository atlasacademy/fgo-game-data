It's nothing to be surprised about.

＠Scáthach
On this land overflowing with magical energy, he used the Holy Grail to survive for 2,000 years.
[k]

＠Scáthach
It's entirely possible that he did, in fact, attain divine beast status.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Scáthach
He's taken this form in retaliation against the person who defeated him long ago. Isn't that right,[sr][charaFace D 2]Twrch Trwyth!?

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
Twrch Trwyth!?[sr]From King Arthur's legends?

[charaFace D 5]

＠Scáthach
Yes, the King of Demon Boars. One who transformed into a boar and ate his way across Britain with his seven piglets.

＠Scáthach
Hmph. To think you drifted all the way to a land like this...

＠Twrch Trwyth
...I was once defeated by Arthur, King of Knights.[sr]But that brat did not consider me a formidable enemy.
[k]


[charaFace C 5]

＠Twrch Trwyth
He should have treated me like a fellow king... But no!
[k]

＠Twrch Trwyth
It's like I was a mere rodent to him the entire time![sr]He bested me and drove me right out of the realm!
[k]

＠Twrch Trwyth
All just to save the suffering, and to retrieve my giant razor, scissors, and comb!
[k]


[charaFace C 2]

＠Twrch Trwyth
I could never forget such humiliation, even after 2,000 or even 3,000 years!
[k]


＠Twrch Trwyth
I wandered all over and finally ended up on this island.[sr]I embraced the Holy Grail and, by doing so, became a behemoth fit to be a divine beast.

His death-like visage comes from his attachment to living. He has fallen into the oblivion between both.
