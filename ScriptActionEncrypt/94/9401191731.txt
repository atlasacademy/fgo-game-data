＠Arnold
All right, we're in business![sr]The calculations are finally complete!
[k]

＠Arnold
But we only have about five minutes at best! In SE.RA.PH time, that's eight hours until we reach the seabed!
[k]

＠Arnold
Now that we know our rate of descent has increased, we're going to have to move our timetable up!
[k]

＠Arnold
[%1]![sr]How is the Sentinel battle coming!?
[k]

＠Arnold
Don't tell me you haven't wrapped things up yet![sr]Tch, just give me a sitrep!

＠Arnold
All right. Got it. Well done, [%1].
[k]

＠Arnold
Now that you've secured a route to the center, get your people back to the church for now.
[k]

＠Arnold
I'll be accompanying you to the planetarium, as is my duty. Now, hurry. Eight hours will blow right by.
[k]

？1：Sorry, but no.
？2：We're going after Meltryllis.

？！

Are you insane? Suzuka Gozen said she fell down an inaccessible chasm. If you go down there...how do you plan on getting back out?

I suppose that rules out any rescue mission.[sr]That is unfortunate.

...Sorry. I stepped away for a moment.

＠Arnold
I have a lot on my mind right now.[sr]I didn't mean to be so hard on you, Mable.
[k]

＠Arnold
...So, [%1]. Let me make this abundantly clear so you do not misunderstand.
[k]

＠Arnold
You're a Master of the prestigious Chaldea.[sr]It's your duty to save us and Seraphix.
[k]

＠Arnold
Now, repeat this order back to me verbatim: you are to return to the church immediately and accompany us to the planetarium. Understood?
[k]

？1：No, we're going to rescue Meltryllis!

？！

＠Arnold
Enough. No more of this foolishness! You are not seriously telling me that you're planning to waste time trying to rescue that Alter Ego after it fell into that pit.
[k]

＠Arnold
Your job is done! That thing is dead! And that's your mission here: to dispose of monsters like the Alter Egos!
[k]

＠Arnold
Your insubordination ends here.[sr]You are to follow my orders to the letter, understand?
[k]

＠Arnold
Let me remind you who will be reporting on your performance when this is over: me, that's who.
[k]

＠Arnold
You've fought tirelessly for our cause up to now. Don't let one stupid decision undo all the good work you've done up to this point, [%1].
[k]

＠Arnold
I'll pretend I didn't hear what you said just now, and you will begin to make your way to[line 2]

Well, that's gonna be close. Can we count on you to remain here and take care of the wire, Mr. Edgelord?

So, I'm the one who has to pull you back up, huh?[sr]Who's going with [%1]?

As for the foolish feline over here... (Sigh) You'll have to stay here, too. Besides, it's obvious that spellwork earlier took its toll on you.

And Mr. Edgelord here could use the support.[sr]So just chill here, 'kay?
