H-hey! What's with the pet name!?
[k]

？2：Osakabehime?

＠Osakabehime
Wh-why so formal!?
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠Osakabehime
This princess is NOT pleased, Master.[sr]Do you know why!?
[k]

？1：Uh, not really...
？！

[charaFace A 2]

＠Osakabehime
...The problem is that you've[sr]gotten way too much chocolate!
[k]

＠Osakabehime
How dare you!?[sr]Yametekudastop, Master!
[k]

＠Osakabehime
And you didn't even stop at chocolates! You've even gotten Divine Beasts, stuffed animals, and holy relics!
[k]

＠Osakabehime
I have a feeling your My Room has[sr]turned into some sort of crazy isekai!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Osakabehime
No wonder it turned into my room with a single flick of a finger during Halloween!
[k]

＠Osakabehime
The way things are going, this place is gonna turn into something like that super creepy Salem!
[k]

＠Osakabehime
The gates of hell will open, the Necro-whatever-con will be opened, and [servantName 202100:Some Gozen lady:Tomoe-chan] will run out all ureshixcited with her dice set!
[k]

＠Osakabehime
That girl can go table-top AND digital!
[k]

？1：Don't say scary stuff like that!
？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠Osakabehime
Since I'm a Castle Apparition, scary stories are my specialty! But I don't like dirty talk!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Osakabehime
Let's put that subject aside...here you go, Master!

[charaFace A 3]

＠Osakabehime
You know, I usually sleep from[sr]daybreak until lunchtime...
[k]

？2：You're turning in early?

[charaFace A 4]

＠Osakabehime
(Gasp)[sr]That's right, the night has only just begun!
[k]


[charaFace A 2]

＠Osakabehime
A hundred years or so ago, I'd be up all night trying to download a single wallpaper on my dialup connection!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Osakabehime
Wait, you know what I mean?[sr]Oh, no, I suppose you wouldn't. Of course not.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 3]

That was a fail![sr]An epic, epic, epic fail!
[k]

＠Osakabehime
I got so excited,[sr]I just blabbed a bunch of nonsense!
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Osakabehime
According to my keikaku, that was supposed[sr]to lead us to a much more romantic situation!
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Osakabehime
My simulations predicted at least a tilt-the-chin-up, kabedon, and throw-them-on-the-bed situation!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Osakabehime
Unnngh...what...what...what was that!?
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Osakabehime
What was up with that tension!?[sr]I can't work under those conditions!
[k]

＠Osakabehime
I can at least tolerate the nerve-racking feeling of battle, but I've never experienced THAT kind of tension!
[k]

＠Osakabehime
That's why being a Servant is the worst!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Osakabehime
I was summoned in my prime,[sr]so my maidenly feelings are also at their peak!
[k]

＠Osakabehime
Ah...I'm so embarrassed...[sr]I should have stayed a hikikomori...ungh...
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Osakabehime
I wonder if Master will eat it...I hope [&he:she] thinks it's delicious...
[k]

＠Osakabehime
...Maybe the message on my card was too dry...
[k]

＠Osakabehime
But then again, when I wrote exactly what I felt, it turned out to be this really embarrassing poem...
[k]

＠Osakabehime
Unnngh...now that I think of it,[sr]the chocolate had a huge crack in it, too...
[k]

＠Osakabehime
And heart-shaped chocolate? What was I thinking?[sr]So boring...[charaFace A 8] Oh crap...now I really want to just hide forever...
[k]

？1：Okki!

[charaFace A 2]

＠Osakabehime
I keep saying, call me Osakabehime!
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

？2：Osakabehime!

＠Osakabehime
Whoa, Master!?
[k]

？！

＠Osakabehime
Wh-what?[sr]Do you need something from me?
[k]

＠Osakabehime
I was just about to log on to the[sr]supernatural chatroom to complain...

[charaFace A 3]

＠Osakabehime
I-it was nothing. It's totally not a big deal,[sr]but I guess it was worth getting off the computer[sr]and putting my next doujin on hold so I could[sr]concentrate on testing the recipe over and over[sr]and since I don't have a refined palate I taste tested[sr]it so many times I got a bit chubbier[sr]but I'm not the LEAST bit worried about bikini season[sr]BECAUSE I TOTALLY WON'T WEAR ONE ANYWAY[sr]so really it was nothing!
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Osakabehime
...A-anyway![sr]Don't...don't itashimention it!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Osakabehime
