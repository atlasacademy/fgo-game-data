All they need do is brush their fingertips across the surface, and it changes to the next page. I wonder what time period it's from...

Books are great. You should all read the book of the gods. It will give you knowledge, and help you grow as a person.
[k]

＠A：???
As far as I'm concerned, there is no downside whatsoever to learning the teachings of the gods.
[k]

＠A：???
It's like a book of instructions,[sr]or maybe commands, or specifications...

Hmm, I can see none of that interests you.[sr]Well then, let me introduce myself.

I'm Enkidu, the thought criminal from the Age of Gods. I've been a prisoner here so long I've lost track of time.

＠Oda Nobunaga
Yeah, come on! Be honest with us. Surely you must have done something else to land you here?
[k]

[charaFace H 1]

＠Oda Nobunaga
My impression of you was that you had done something like, say...force people to play a game where they have to look for a bomb you've hidden in a teapot...
[k]

＠Oda Nobunaga
...or maybe trick some weak-willed people into starting a riot with words alone. You know, some sort of devilish criminal genius plot like that.

Impressions, eh. That was certainly part of it.[sr]As soon as Medb saw me, she said:
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Enkidu
“That face! That's the face of a dastardly mastermind! A psychopath who thinks as little of plotting to overthrow nations as he does making his morning tea!”
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Enkidu
“That's the kind of criminal who would come up with the sort of calculated, coldhearted plot that could throw the entire kingdom of Connacht into pandemonium and somehow leave their hands completely clean when it was all over!”
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Enkidu
“That's the kind of loathsome deviant we're dealing with here! Everyone, get them!”
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Enkidu
And just like that, they brought me here, no questions asked. It was, as they say, a trumped-up charge.

And even if you had, there is no way you could hope to reform while bound as you are. As a prefect, I cannot overlook this transgression.

＠Enkidu
My, it's been so long since I've had my restraints removed for anything other than meals.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Thank you. Those restraints were made to be impossible for me to remove on my own, so there's no telling how long I might have had to stay here if you hadn't come along.
[k]

＠Enkidu
As you can see, Queen Medb's weakness is the fact that she is focused solely on restraining criminals, and is thus helpless against other forms of power.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Enkidu
Her authority must only extend to captured criminals, and doesn't have any effect on external sources of power.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Enkidu
Say, I know this is shameless of me since you've already been kind enough to help me, but since it's been so long since I've been free, I hope you don't mind if I ask you for another favor?

Right now, I am a summer maid devoted to serving Master. However, I would be willing to make a house call if [&he:she] were to grant me permission.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Altria Alter
That would even give me an excuse to employ the Maid Rewards Cards I made, though I never truly believed I would have a chance to make use of them.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
Very well, your pleas have convinced me, I shall clean up everything in this room so fast it will make your head spin...[charaFace D 1]and I shall not stop until, with tears in your eyes, you beg me to do so.

No, it's not that. I mean, I WOULD love for you to clean up the rust and mold that's built up here over the years, but I have something else in mind.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Enkidu
I've been bound up in here for so long that I'm a little worried I may not be fully functional.
[k]

＠Enkidu
It's not exactly an urgent matter right now...but as a weapon, it would be very embarrassing to find out I wasn't functioning properly in the middle of a battle.

Could I ask you to assist me in a combat test,[sr]so I can see how everything is working?

Although, I suppose I cannot say I am surprised, given how you have been forced to live in a moldy, rat-infested cell like this for so long.

＠Nero
Fortunately for you, I am as generous as I am kind. Children often asked me to play with them when I traveled around town incognito, and I would gladly oblige them.

Of course, I am also an exemplary emperor who takes every one of her pursuits seriously, so I always ended up beating them so soundly they would go home bawling!
