＠Mash
They got away again.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
...No. Considering our injuries and fatigue[line 2][sr]I guess we dealt a fair amount of damage.
[k]

＠Mash
...
[k]

？1：What are you looking at, Mash?
？2：If you're tired, you should rest.

？！

＠Mash
I was just thinking about what the Doctor said yesterday.
[k]

？1：(So you were listening to our conversation?)
？！

＠Mash
Our goal is to resolve whatever's causing the abnormalities that exist in this place.
[k]



＠Mash
At the moment, it's clear that our biggest problem is the oni that lives by this gate[line 2]
[k]

＠Mash
But maybe we don't necessarily have to defeat it.

＠Sakata Kintoki
You want to turn a blind eye to it?[sr]That doesn't seem like a golden idea...
[k]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
No, I'm not saying we should turn a blind eye to it.
[k]



＠Mash
But say that Ibaraki-Douji's power comes from this “source” beyond the gate[line 2]
[k]

＠Mash
In which case, it would make more sense to wipe that out first. That's what I meant.
[k]



＠Mash
For instance, by climbing over the gate rather than under it. Or maybe we could find a way to go around it...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]



＠Sakata Kintoki
Ahh, so that's what you meant.[sr]Then your objective makes sense, but...
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
We couldn't possibly climb over the gate.[sr]Look at its top.
[k]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
...Yes. I did see that too.
[k]

＠Mash
There's a sinister, thick, fog-like, cloudy-looking something that's hanging over the gate and wall.
[k]

＠Mash
I don't know what it is, but I'm willing to bet it's something bad.
[k]

＠Mash
There's no telling what it would do even to a Servant if they tried to touch it...
[k]

？1：Looks like climbing over the gate is not possible...

＠Mash
Yes, Master. Which is why I'd like to go scout a little and see if we can find a detour around it.
[k]

？2：So how about finding a detour?

＠Mash
Yes, Master. Let's check the area again for possible detours before we stop to rest for the night.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
Even if we can't climb over the gate or the enclosing fences, if there's some other path to the other side...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Maybe our prospects will look better...
[k]

...Doesn't seem like there's anything.
[k]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 12]



＠Mash
Yes. Basically, it seems the heart of Kyoto is surrounded on all sides by that poisonous fog-looking substance.
[k]

＠Mash
That said... Now that we're seeing the west end of the city for the first time, I've just realized...
[k]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 3]

＠Sakata Kintoki
There's a freakin' humongous cliff here for some reason. I almost can't believe it, but there it is.
[k]


＠Sakata Kintoki
This era... I mean, this Japan right now, must have shrunken or something. Or should I say the islands have been squashed?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
The topography is crazy. Unexpectedly the ocean is up against Kyoto's west side...
[k]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
...Right. It does look like there's something like an island beyond that fog, but since we don't have a boat...
[k]


＠Sakata Kintoki
I don't dislike this golden sense of scale, though.[sr]But it looks like there's no way to make that detour.
[k]

[charaTalk A]

＠Mash
You're probably right. It seems... that we do need to beat Ibaraki-Douji in order to proceed.
[k]

？1：It may be a tough fight, but let's give it our best shot.

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Yes, Master. Of course, we will. As poor as my abilities are, I will absolutely give it my utmost effort.
[k]

？2：We can't give up now.

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Yes, Master. Of course, we won't.[sr]I have no intention of giving up.
[k]

＠Mash
As poor as my abilities are, I will absolutely give it my utmost effort.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
...
[k]


＠Mash
(Even so, Kyoto... this topography... It's just too different from the Japan we know...)
[k]

＠Mash
(What on earth is happening in this Japan?)
