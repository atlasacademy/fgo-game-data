Master! Down that corridor![sr]Someone's lying on the ground!
[k]

＠El-Melloi
He's...dead. From the look of things, this was definitely the Master that summoned Caster.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...No... Did he have a fight with his Servant?

＠El-Melloi
The wound is too clean.[sr]That's not how Caster would kill.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
But then who? Hmm...

Huh? But there wasn't anything a moment ago...

Presence Concealment. An Assassin? Without the[sr]Qi Men Dun Jia, we'd have been in danger too.

Is this another one of the Assassins from before?[sr]It feels different.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
This is...different. There was no Servant like this in the Fourth Holy Grail War I knew.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Then this is the “irregularity” that you were searching for?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Perhaps. This may be what has twisted the 1994 Fuyuki into a Singularity.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Even if this isn't the original cause, there must be some connection.

That's not an option. We need to know who you are, and why you're here.

That's practically why we came here, after all.

You heard them, [%1]. Though regrettable, it seems like violence is our only option.

We'll neutralize and capture them, and then get them to cooperate!
