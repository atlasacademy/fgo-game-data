＠Vlad III
...Indeed. That was truly a bone-shattering blow![sr]Your sword is every bit the equal of my spear!
[k]

＠Vlad III
Hah ha! Only an immortal vampire could survive such a powerful strike! So, clearly I cannot!
[k]

？1：What you say earlier...
？2：Before you go, I want you to tell me...!

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Vlad III
Hm... It seems I let my passion get the better of me.[sr]I should not have said that.
[k]

＠Vlad III
If you wish to know, then hurry to the chapel.
[k]

＠Vlad III
Your Servant, the Archer from Chaldea, awaits you there.

So this is where Archer ended up.[sr]It is fortunate we were able to find him. However...
[k]

＠Gawain
(Why does he not come out of his own accord...?[sr]He must be aware Master is here.)
[k]

＠Gawain
(And surely any Servant of [%1] would come immediately to [&his:her] aid...)

You have every right to be suspicious, Knight of the Sun. That man is not to be trusted...

＠Vlad III
Ally or not, I would not lower my guard around him if I were you. Here on SE.RA.PH...
[k]

＠Vlad III
You will be absorbed the moment you reveal any sign of weakness, no matter who you are. Remember that...

Let's hurry to the chapel.[sr]The Archer from Chaldea, eh...
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠Meltryllis
The one with twin blades and a red coat, was it?[sr]What a joke.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
But if you insist he join us, I'd be okay with that...[sr]After I give him a good beating.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
I doubt he'll be any help in battle, but we can always use another meat shield. Now come on, run!

I-I, uh, don't have the best memories of that chapel... But I guess we don't have any other place to rest, do we...

I think there were some private rooms on the second floor too, so... Okay...

Count Vlad's warning does concern me, but [%1] cannot afford to wait any longer.

Let us go inside. After all, we have no less than three capable Servants between us.
[k]

＠Gawain
It should be well within our means to deal with whatever awaits us.
