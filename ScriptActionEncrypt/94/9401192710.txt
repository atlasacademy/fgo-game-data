＠BB/GO
So, you finally made it. You sure kept me waiting for a long time, [%1].
[k]

＠BB/GO
How'd you like the route to my heart? Did it positively shred your soul to wound so many former allies?
[k]

＠BB/GO
Is the despair clutching your heart after betrayal upon betrayal? Do you feel smaller than a bug now, hmm?
[k]

？1：Hey, did you steal this temple design...?
？2：...So you ARE just reusing old assets...

？！

[charaFace E 2]
＠BB/GO
What!? No! I just have an appreciation for Greek architecture! My tastes are just really refined!

Indeed. You clearly don't hold a candle to Kiara, but your dark and twisted nature is still exactly that.

You will wither away like cherry blossoms in the face of our solidarity.

You said it, Caster. It's been a hell of a ride to get to this point, but our bonds are the real deal.
[k]

＠Emiya
It's been adventure after adventure.[sr]Drama upon drama. Pretty epic overall.
[k]

＠Emiya
We may have had to skip some parts because of time constraints, but it was still an epic to be remembered for generations to come. I couldn't be more pleased with it.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]

And it was all thanks to [%1], our excellent Master.

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 0.7]

(Huff, puff) Of course you'd just go ahead and add them back to your party, wouldn't you...
[k]

＠BB/GO
Well, listen up. This is MY final stage, made entirely BY me, FOR me.
[k]

＠BB/GO
This is as hardcore as it gets. Make sure you keep that in mind, [%1].
[k]

？1：Yeah...I know...

[charaFace E 6]
＠BB/GO
...I see you're just feeling sorry for me,[sr]but I'll let that slide.

That's more like it! I'm glad to see you finally recognize me as the threat I am, Senpai!

？！

[charaFace E 12]
＠BB/GO
I'm a perfect AI.[sr]My intellect surpasses humans in every way.
[k]

＠BB/GO
I have no reason to protect or save them. But then again, that would leave you in far too sorry a state.
[k]

＠BB/GO
You know how a messy desk gets annoying, right? So I'll be nice and pare you humans down to only what you need.
[k]

＠BB/GO
If you envy others their beauty, I'll gouge out your eyes and turn you into a bat that can navigate by sound.
[k]

＠BB/GO
If you can't stand to hear others be happy, I'll stop up your ears and turn you into a dog that only eats all day.
[k]

＠BB/GO
If nature's scents offend you, I'll cut off your nose and turn you into a parakeet only able to look at pictures.
[k]

＠BB/GO
If you want to avoid conflict, I'll plug up your mouth and turn you into a doll that does nothing but sleep.
[k]

＠BB/GO
If life gets to be too much trouble, I'll pluck off your appendages and turn you into one of my accessories.
[k]

＠BB/GO
...You see what I mean?[sr]You humans have far too many things to worry about.
[k]

＠BB/GO
So I'm willing to resolve them for you.
[k]

＠BB/GO
As a superior intellect, I'm obligated to save you from yourselves.

[%1], she's a rogue AI. A mistake.[sr]She needs to be defeated.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠BB
This isn't about me!

[charaFace A 5]

I'm not talking about errors or bugs or anything of the sort! She's becoming too human!

＠BB
That way of thinking is itself human, BB/GO.
[k]

＠BB
No matter what our specs might be like, we would never think of humans as inferior.
[k]

＠BB
The very idea of a hierarchy is a human one.[sr]And yet, you called yourself a “superior” intellect.
[k]

＠BB
You were tainted with a bestial nature when you were salvaged from Kiara.
[k]

＠BB
Pity. Comparison. Lust. It's those sorts of feelings that are making you act like a human instead of like an AI.
[k]

＠BB
Ironically enough, you're actually trying to become the sort of human we used to dream about becoming.

[k]

＠BB/GO
Why would I try to devolve myself into a human?[sr]The very idea is absurd.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_24 0.1]

＠BB/GO
No. I'm going to prove I'm a superior being to humans by taking control of humanity.
[k]

＠BB/GO
And I won't let anyone get in my way. Not an identical AI like you. Not sample case like [%1], the only one to have ever made [&his:her] way into SE.RA.PH.
[k]

＠BB/GO
I will defeat you. Both of you.
[k]

＠BB/GO
And when I do, the reformatting of myself into humanity's admin will be complete.
[k]

[charaFace E 9]
＠BB/GO
...The dialogue scene is over, human.[sr]It's time for me to execute my self-appointed task.
[k]

＠BB/GO
If you want to defy me, go ahead and do your worst. Otherwise, your sample case will just be wasted.
[k]

[charaFace E 12]
＠BB/GO
Not that your pitiful specs will even come anywhere close to mine, of course.
[k]

＠BB/GO
Now let me hear you squeal like the swine you are!
