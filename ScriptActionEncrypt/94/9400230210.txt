Since you were summoned as a Ruler class, I'm at a disadvantage.

[charaFace F 4]

Well, this is a problem.[sr]We're at an impasse now.

If that Rider would become an ally instead...

[charaFace E 4]
＠E：???
Unfortunately, that Rider hates us both.

[charaFace E 0]
＠E：???
Well, no.
[k]

＠E：???
I don't think you're hated. Just... Maybe the Rider knows how you're going to end up in the future.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠F：???
Ouch, that stings.[sr]I personally want to grow up to be a proper person.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：???
[line 2]Well, if the Rider turns against me, that's fine.[sr]Can't do much about it.
[k]

＠E：???
As expected from the world-renowned King of Heroes. ...I didn't think you'd be this young.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
I didn't think I'd get summoned like this either.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
If Servants are summoned at their peak condition, I should've shown up in such a form as well, but...
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
It seems this Holy Grail is bugging out.[sr]So I would like to ask you to hand it over right away.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
This isn't something that a pretend holy man from the Far East should be playing with, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Amakusa Shirou
Hahaha. I can't deny that reputation of mine.[sr]But I have a dream of my own.

[charaFace E 0]
＠Amakusa Shirou
“I have spread my dreams under your feet.[sr]Tread softly because you stroll on my dreams.”
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
[line 2]So, unfortunately, I can't just do that.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
Looks like there's no choice, then. I'm not sure when we'll settle this, but we'll have to fight[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Amakusa Shirou
Yes.[sr]...Looks like we'll have to get down to it.

It's only natural that I would desire the Holy Grail.[sr]It is in a king's nature to wish to amass fortune.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
Also, when we're talking about a Holy Grail that will grant every...well, almost every wish, we have to be very careful.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Gilgamesh (Child)
In that case, it should be a king's duty to store away such an object. It's not like there's anything I would wish at this time, anyway.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh (Child)
No return here, but no risk involved.

Master, given the situation here, don't you think it would be best to let me handle the Grail?

What Gilgamesh says is true. The Holy Grail is dangerous. However, as a neutral power, it should be used to maximum effect.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Amakusa Shirou
...This pseudo Holy Grail isn't enough to fulfill my wish, however.
[k]

？1：Wish?

[charaFace E 0]
＠Amakusa Shirou
My wish is everlasting world peace. But with the current state of things, I'm not sure it'll make it that far.
[k]

？2：Isn't enough?

[charaFace E 0]
＠Amakusa Shirou
I'd like to wish for world peace, but unfortunately, this world is about to be incinerated.
[k]

＠Amakusa Shirou
Even if the world isn't incinerated, this Holy Grail will never be able to bring about perfect world peace.
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 4]
＠Amakusa Shirou
...But it'd be an extreme waste just to keep this Holy Grail locked away.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

Fortunately, I know how the Holy Grail works.[sr]It would be best if you let me handle the Grail.

I have data on the pseudo Holy Grail.[sr]It's growing, eating the magic energy around it.

At this rate, it's going to stop being pseudo. You can't give that to a Servant you haven't contracted with...
