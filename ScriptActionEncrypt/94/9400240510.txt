＠C：Mercédès
...I'm sorry?[sr]You asked where Avenger went?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠C：Mercédès
Um, he just left. He said something about scouting outside.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠C：Mercédès
He should be back soon.[sr]He said there's no need to follow him.
[k]

？1：Outside always seems the same.

[charaFace C 0]
＠C：Mercédès
Does it?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠C：Mercédès
No, I never leave this cell...[sr]But it's strange.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠C：Mercédès
The hallway beyond these bars never changes.[sr]It always just goes one way.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠C：Mercédès
But at the end of it, there's always a different Lord in the Hall of Judgment, they say.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
...Avenger says that the hallway, and the Hall of Judgment, change each day.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
You're getting further each day.[sr]Deeper and deeper in.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠C：Mercédès
This cell moves deeper, along with you.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
That's what Avenger said.
[k]

？2：...Avenger's actually a nice guy.

[charaFace C 1]
＠C：Mercédès
...You're right.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
He may be rough with his words,[sr]but he doesn't seem to dislike you.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠C：Mercédès
In fact...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠C：Mercédès
No, never mind.[sr]Perhaps I'm imagining it.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠C：Mercédès
...You're fighting every day, aren't you?[sr]With the Lords in the Hall of Judgment.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
The day you saved me, it was like something out of a myth.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠C：Mercédès
The way you fought that monster who called itself Fergus...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠C：Mercédès
It was like an ancient hero. It didn't seem real.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
Avenger said that the souls gathered here were trapped by something.
[k]

＠C：Mercédès
Even Heroic Spirits... Powerful souls greater than humans...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠C：Mercédès
I'm nothing like that.[sr]I couldn't be a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠C：Mercédès
But I... I'm here in Château d'If as well...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠C：Mercédès
I am a trapped soul. Perhaps I was chosen as the avatar of some sin, too.
[k]

？1：It's probably the work of the King of Mages.
？2：It might just be bad luck.

？！

[charaFace C 1]
＠C：Mercédès
Thank you, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠C：Mercédès
I wonder if anyone can truly exist without sin.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠C：Mercédès
Anger, envy... The degrees may vary, but they're both the workings of a functional mind.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠C：Mercédès
If they are sins, who but God could judge them?

＠Caligula
To be lost and uncertain is man's destiny.
[k]

＠Caligula
But perhaps it's not quite right for me to speak of what life should be.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Caligula
Hmmph. I see surprise in your eyes. My madness is a gift of the lunar goddess, and sometimes it is lost.
[k]

＠Caligula
It doesn't happen normally, but this is the pit of hell. Even the goddess' eyes cannot see you here.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Caligula
...But without madness, I cannot touch my beloved child. It is upsetting.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Caligula
I manifest as a Berserker class.[sr]I am not allowed to speak without madness.
[k]

＠Caligula
Only here, as your body and soul separate ever further, can I speak to you.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Caligula
Oh, Nero[line 3] Beloved child, the living image of my sister Agrippina.
[k]

＠Caligula
Please, please... Enjoy some happiness, no matter how small.
[k]

＠Caligula
I shall take with me madness and rage.[sr]May the path you tread be filled with roses of blessing.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Caligula
...I'm sorry. I should be speaking to you, but instead my lips speak of my beloved niece.
[k]

？1：(Nero's great, huh?)

＠Caligula
...I can see your thoughts in your eyes.[sr]Yes. Yes, you're very right.
[k]

？2：(I understand.)

＠Caligula
Yes. ...Yes.

Fou, fou.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Caligula
Yes, there is little time.[sr]I must speak to you, [%1].
[k]

＠Caligula
[line 3]Have you ever tried to devour everything?
[k]

＠Caligula
Have you ever eaten and eaten and been unfulfilled, as if you were a starving man?
[k]

＠Caligula
Have you consumed and consumed, making yourself a slave to the hunger of the soul?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Caligula
I have.
[k]
[charaFace D 0]
Or was that all I was?
[k]

＠Caligula
I ate. I consumed. I filled my unloved body with my desires.
[k]

＠Caligula
The sin of Gluttony.[sr]The malignant tumor of Rome.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Caligula
...My life may have been evil.[sr]Indeed, I'm sure that's what later generations said.
[k]

＠Caligula
The moon goddess may have toyed with me, or perhaps I was born evil.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Caligula
But my soul was carved into history as a Heroic Spirit, not an Anti-Hero. And that...
[k]

＠Caligula
I must believe that somewhere in my heart, some tiny bit of love was left.
[k]

＠Caligula
And thus[line 3]

＠B：Avenger
An avatar of evil, who devours all the pleasures of the world and still seeks more.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
Thus, he should be a very simple opponent.[sr]No need for complexities like last time.
