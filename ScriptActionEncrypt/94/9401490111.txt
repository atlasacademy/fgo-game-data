Battle has ended.[sr]I'm not detecting any other enemies in your vicinity.

＠Mash
Good work, Senpai. [charaFace C 6]...Senpai?
[k]

？1：Holmes...
？2：...Bare-knuckle boxing?

？！

[charaFace C 6]

＠Mash
Now that you mention it...!
[k]

[charaFace C 7]

＠Mash
Mister Holmes did use a special...facade in previous battles, saying there was an issue with his Spirit Origin.
[k]

＠Mash
But this time...his appearance didn't change during battle!
[k]

[charaFace C 7]

＠Mash
And he fought with his bare hands! Could that possibly be the famed, mysterious martial arts style...
[k]

[charaFace C 8]

＠Mash
...that Mister Holmes utilized...taken directly from the stories of Sir Conan Doyle!?

I haven't used Baritsu for a long time, but it is quite a thrill.[charaFace A 0] Hm? What's the matter, Miss Kyrielight?
[k]

＠Holmes
And with you, Master?[sr]As my Master, shouldn't Baritsu be familiar to you?
[k]

？1：Um, I don't know Baritsu.
？2：Wait, what? “Master”!?

？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠Holmes
Ah yes, I suppose I neglected to mention that.

＠Holmes
I have officially become a Servant of Chaldea, and formed a contract with you. I did so last night.
[k]

＠Holmes
We already had a connection, so it was only a matter of time... The rest... Well, a variety of circumstances and changes have taken place.
[k]

？1：Wait a minute, your Class...
？2：I-is the label of Ruler a typo...?

？！

Ah, yes. I mentioned I was a Caster. Forgive me. I lied.

A jest. My apologies. I couldn't help myself.[sr]Allow me to explain in all seriousness.

＠Holmes
When I officially became a Servant of Chaldea, my Spirit Origin changed...significantly, much to my surprise, as I am sure you can imagine.
[k]

＠Holmes
I was, most assuredly, a Caster before.[sr]But as of now, I am Sherlock Holmes, Ruler.
[k]

？1：You turned into a Ruler!
？2：So that wasn't a typo!

＠Mash
Since he is a great detective who has solved many difficult cases, it may indeed be appropriate to call Holmes a peacemaker or a mediator.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Mash
No, I should not even say “may” in this case![sr]I should say instead that this was very likely to happen!
[k]

[charaFace C 7]

＠Mash
In the past, Jeanne, Martha, and Amakusa Shirou all told me the following:
[k]

＠Mash
In the case of Heroic Spirit summoning based on the Holy Grail, only actual saints could be summoned as Rulers...
[k]

＠Mash
But Chaldea's summoning system is not bound by such rules.

To make a ruling should be the job of a judge or a jury. My goodness...
