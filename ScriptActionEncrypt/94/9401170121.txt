It wasn't the Beast I was looking for, but at the very least, its death should halt this place's deterioration.

＠Arthur
I'm not entirely clear on how all this works.[sr]But apparently this is what my journey entails.

？1：King Arthur, you promised.
？2：Please continue your story.

Oh, right. There's something I need to tell you.

＠Da Vinci
...Uh, ahem. Hey. It's me, Da Vinci.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
There was a...tiny snafu in the program that handles the Rayshift coordinate calculations.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
It wasn't a mistake that just developed out of nowhere. It was there from the beginning. Let's just say that there was a shortcoming in one of the formulae.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The result itself doesn't change.[sr]But[charaFace C 4] yeah, it's a bug.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That's what was causing all the problems. It was Rayshifting you, and only you, to weird coordinates.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Anyway, simply put, it was just a bug. I'm sorry, really! It wasn't that I made any mistakes in the design stage; it was just me being negligent as a manager!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Oh, and it's not Romani's fault either. It's my fault, since it's all under my jurisdiction. I'm really sorry!
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
Babbage was the one who found it after doing some calculations because he had nothing better to do. I guess you really can't give those analog folks flak.
[k]

？1：I see... I mean, wait a minute!
？2：I'm in the middle of talking to King Arthur!

...Seems like they cannot see me.[sr]Perhaps my Spirit Origin does not exist in your world.
[k]

＠Arthur
If the King Arthur you know is female, that means she's me, but not me.
[k]

＠Arthur
I don't exist. At least not in your world's history.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Arthur
You may need to ask Merlin for details, but yeah.
[k]

＠Arthur
I'm sure that's what it is.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Arthur
...Oh, or maybe it's because my warp has already started?

？！

You should already know. It's the same name that the beautiful lady mentioned just now.
[k]

？1：So it was Romani Archaman...!

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Arthur
Yes, that's right.
[k]

＠Arthur
I firmly believe that the person he was talking about was you.
[k]

＠Arthur
How is he doing now?[sr][charaFace B 13]...No, I shouldn't ask. At least not right now. Not now.

[charaFace B 0]

That's why, [%1]...

I'm glad I met you, brave child,[sr]savior of the planet under a distant sky.

＠Arthur
You, who inherited the will of the man I encountered during my journey.
[k]

＠Arthur
May your perilous journey be blessed, [%1]! And when we meet again under the same sky, someday, someplace...
[k]

＠Arthur
Let us fight alongside each other again.
[k]

＠Arthur
To save your world. To save tomorrow.

Hm? What is it, Doctor?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
Hehe. I don't have as much free time as before.[sr]You see, everyone realized how useful I am.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That's why I'm super busy every day. I mean, think we're taking too much of the burden of Chaldea's future onto ourselves?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
But that's just me complaining. Though, I don't mind sparing some time to listen to you talk.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...Hm? Would I be okay with just idle chitchat or gossip?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
Yeah, sure. I'm just going to work while I listen.[sr]Now come on, talk to me.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Uh-huh. Oh. I see. Ah.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Yep.

＠Da Vinci
...Eh? What? What did you just say?
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
Before that. The thing you said before that.[sr]Something about a thing near the bridge in Fuyuki City.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...You've met the male King Arthur?[sr]Was he a Heroic Spirit? When?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
Before Chaldea's Summoning System was established?[sr]But that's impossible. How long ago was that?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Either way, that was after Fuyuki's Grail War ended, right? Even with a tremendous amount of spiritual evocation and other powerful ceremonial magecraft...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Summoning a Heroic Spirit that can converse coherently would be impossible.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
Besides...

[charaFace C 5]

Hm. Wait. Something's not right.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Da Vinci
If what you're saying is true, it must be because of that![sr]The Singularity in Fuyuki! The Greater Grail!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So that reaction you had when you first saw the female King Arthur on the monitor was...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
...Eh?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You forgot? Completely?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...Yeah, I don't blame you. If a random man calling himself King Arthur came up to you, no one would give it much credence.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Nobody would think, “Whoa, it's the real King Arthur!” And I'm sure he wouldn't stick out in your memory. But then again...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
You have your position to think about.[sr]You're in Chaldea, after all.
[k]

＠Da Vinci

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
...Oh. I see.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You say that, but the expression on your face tells me you're fondly thinking back on that day, Romani.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.[sr]Heh heh. Oh, let me guess.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]
＠Da Vinci
I bet you said something really embarrassing!
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
Am I right?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
Hahahaha. Nope. Can't do that. You can't say you were kidding after that reaction! There's no fooling me!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Just give up and tell me everything![sr]Come on, I won't judge!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
It'll be all right. So what did you tell him?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
Eh? You made a wish?[sr]To the King Arthur you saw in Fuyuki?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
What did you wish for...?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
No. Yeah. It'll be much more interesting if you don't tell me right now.
