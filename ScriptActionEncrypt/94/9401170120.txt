Why? I turned around, surrounded by a field of golden grass.

The time I spent fighting for Britain... Ten years of bravery and honor, charging from battlefield to battlefield with the Knights of the Round Table.
[k]

＠
And that's not all: even the time I spent living as a solitary knight after that...
[k]

＠
...and yes, even that two-week-long Holy Grail War in the Far East at the end of the 20th century[line 2]one fought over a false Grail...
[k]

＠
...all for the sake of a girl who taught me things I never would have learned in my life as a king.

I just arrived here.[sr]I did what I needed to do, and ended everything.

I finally reached the place...the promised place. Just as the legend to be passed down through the ages said.

[charaFace B 4]

I thought I was going to form a contract with the world...

[charaFace B 5]

But that is not how it went.[sr]I got my answer, and then my life ended.

...Hehe.
[k]

＠Female Mage
You have the appearance of a young man,[sr]yet you speak like an old man.
[k]

＠Female Mage
No, I wonder. My king. Britain's eternal king and wielder of the sacred sword...
[k]

＠Female Mage
There must be many things you have left undone.[sr]I'm sure you know already, right?
[k]

＠Female Mage
You have yet to truly and finally defeat that which you are destined to destroy.
[k]

＠Female Mage
Once in 1991 A.D.[sr]Once more in 1999 A.D.

Yes, it is a state of emergency so severe, you were roped into this the instant you arrived at Avalon!

[charaFace B 5]

You still need to continue your journey.[sr]Whether it be in your world, or in another universe.

You may travel through dimensions or even phenomena. Anywho, yeah, hang in there.
[k]

＠Female Mage
Why? How, you ask? Well...[sr]Yeah, I wonder... I can't say for sure.
[k]

＠Female Mage
This could be a deep-seated curse put on you as the wielder of a sacred sword, or it could be something that was sprung on you right before a long break...

I'm going to say this again:[sr]your journey has not ended.

＠Female Mage
It can't end. For her sake as well.

＠Female Mage
What did you feel from her?[sr]Light? Radiance? Affection? Or all of them?

I'm sorry, [%1].

It's time to battle. I'm sure our opponent will come at us with everything it has, so I cannot hold back.

Let's go. For now, you shall be my Master!

And to go along with your dazzling actions,[sr]I shall show you the light of this planet!
