What, a gift? From you, to me?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
...You really have no sense of timing or occasion. You made your move even before I graced you with my gifts.

＠Gilgamesh
Fine. I shall accept your impudence as your strength. You are, after all, the fool who overcame that trial on courage alone.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
So? Where is this offering of yours?[sr]Don't make me wait. Hurry up and present it to me.

＠Gilgamesh
...Hey. Is this that thing? That thing the common Heroic Servants are getting all excited over?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Valentine's Day chocolate, yes?
[k]

？1：Yes.
？2：This is the best I have to offer.

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Gilgamesh
Arrgh...! Fool! Who do you think I am!?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I may be holding back right now, but I am the king of Uruk, who indulges extravagance! I am a man who collects all the wealth of the world!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Gilgamesh
...Well, Ishtar has taken over a part of my treasury, but let's not focus on that. It was a necessary evil.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Gilgamesh
But to present me...ME with such a gift! Know your place! Reflect deeply, from the very bottom of the underworld itself, upon what you have just done!
[k]

？1：I guess a handmade item made by an amateur was no good...
？2：If only there was a high-end brand-name store in Chaldea...!

？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Gilgamesh
Fool, I'm not talking about quality. I'm talking about quantity! This tiny confection is hardly a mouthful!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
This is like ending a banquet the moment it starts! Why you, do you intend to end your precious time with me in mere moments?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Gilgamesh
...Ha! Pitiful. But I suppose I should expect no more from such a pathetic excuse for a Master.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I have no choice. Just this one time, I shall show you what a proper Valentine's Day gift looks like.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Gilgamesh
Follow me, [%1]. I shall fully educate you on the nature of my treasured Uruk.
