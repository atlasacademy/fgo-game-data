＠Mash
Surprisingly, this turned into quite the maze.
[k]

＠Mash
Wherever you look every single hedge is trimmed perfectly. Scáthach's pruning technique is flawless.
[k]


？1：You can really get lost in here.
？！

Then go and get lost.[sr]That's what's so fun about mazes.
[k]

＠Marie
I mean, entering a maze and not getting lost?[sr]How boring! That's why...

Fou?

Hehe. You're not allowed to walk ahead.[sr]You might find the exit by smell. I'll hold you!

？1：Do you like mazes?

＠Marie
Yes, I do. A lot!
[k]


？2：You're in a good mood, Princess.

＠Marie
Hehe. “But of course”... is what I should say, I guess?[sr]Not a single objection, that is!

Is there a reason you like mazes?

＠Marie
Hmm? Well... It's difficult to answer when you put it that way. There was always one where I lived, after all.
[k]

＠Marie
There was one at Versailles, and at Schönbrunn in Austria. Oh, that's the palace I was living at when I first met Amadeus.
[k]

＠Marie
But the one at Versailles isn't there anymore.[sr]I liked it, but my husband...
[k]

＠Marie
Yes. Perhaps that is the reason.

＠Marie
When I became the queen, and entered into the royal family, I wasn't allowed to lose my way any longer.
[k]


＠Marie
What I needed to do had been predetermined, and things I couldn't do were also decided for me. I went through a lot.
[k]

＠Marie
But in a maze, you're allowed to not know where to go. Like a child, you get lost, and just simply search for the exit.
[k]

＠Marie
So perhaps that ended up being a way to relieve stress for me? I'm not sure, though.

I can't say for certain, but... I do think I understand.
[k]


？1：All right! Let's try and get lost, then!

＠Mash
I think you don't have to try getting lost.[sr]But yes, let's have fun.
[k]


？2：Okay. In any case... let's go this way!

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Senpai, we just came from this direction!

F-Fou...
[k]

＠Marie
Fou's making a face like, “Why can't you dumb humans smell your way out of this maze!?”
[k]


[charaFace F 1]
＠Marie
Okay, we can't lose to Fou! Let's find our way out!
[k]

＠Marie
But if it's dinnertime and we still can't find our way out, let's have Fou help us.
