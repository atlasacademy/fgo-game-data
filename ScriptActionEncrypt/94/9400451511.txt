But you don't have to worry.[sr]After all, I've already done this once before.

...Kintoki? Then what you're saying is, to eliminate[sr]Ushi Gozen, we just need to...
[k]

[charaTalk E]

Yeah, you just need to knock her out.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Ushi Gozen and Boss Raikou are the same person.[sr]It's impossible to separate them from the start.

＠Sakata Kintoki
So, a long time ago, I[line 2]
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I stepped into the fight between Boss Raikou and the part she wanted to cut off, Ushi Gozen.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
...I floored Raikou with a blow when she was trying to kill herself. I told her to stop being a dumbass.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I even got on my knees, wept, and begged her to stop.[sr]The situation back then was much worse, but...
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
In the end, it was Ushi Gozen that gave in. She jumped in front of my lightning strike and got knocked out.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Like, literally out. That Ushi Gozen side never came back.

[charaTalk E]
[charaFace E 7]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I know. We can only wait and see what happens. Anyway, this isn't something like the luck of the draw or a random bet.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Ushi Gozen comes out when Minamoto-no-Raikou builds up too much divine energy inside.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
You saw how much energy she released, right? Going crazy like that would make even Gozu Tenno tap out...
