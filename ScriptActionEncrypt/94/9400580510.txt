＠Martha
Oh, this is just bitchin'! What a fabulous well!
[k]

？1：Umm...why do you sound like that?

[charaFace G 5]
＠Martha
O-Oh. What are you talking about?
[k]


？2：(Pretend not to hear)

[charaFace G 5]
＠Martha
...Oh, this isn't good.
[k]

？！

[charaFace G 5]
＠Martha
Perhaps it's because I'm in a swimsuit I'm not used to.[sr]I feel like “it” comes out whenever I let my guard down.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Martha
Anyway, this well may seem odd to a modern person like you, but...
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Martha
Wells were an important source of water during my time too. So I feel quite nostalgic.
[k]


？1：Why don't we call it “Martha's Well”?
？！

[charaFace G 0]
＠Martha
Hehe. I haven't done anything. Since you dug it, shouldn't it be “[%1]'s Well”?
[k]

＠Martha
If you really want to name it something else, maybe take a famous name...like “Jacob's Well” or something...

＠Martha
If I were that Samaritan woman,[sr]would I have given Him water...?
[k]


？1：Martha?
？！

[charaFace G 0]
＠Martha
Oh, it's nothing. I was just reminiscing about days gone by and my mind wandered.
[k]

＠Martha
How strange that a well on a desert island would conjure images of the past.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Martha
Perhaps because my past had nothing,[sr]just like this island.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Martha
...Then again, it was 2,000 years ago. Of course there was nothing. No civilization, no machinery...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Martha
Yes...it brings back memories.[sr]I had nothing, but I was happy.
[k]


？1：Happy?

[charaFace G 1]
＠Martha
Yes, happy. Since I had nothing to begin with,[sr]I appreciated what was granted to me.
[k]


？2：Wasn't it inconvenient?

[charaFace G 1]
＠Martha
There were some inconveniences, but I was happy.
[k]

＠Martha
And with nothing, I could realize the importance of the things that were granted to me.
[k]


？！

[charaFace G 1]
＠Martha
[line 2]God's love and faith.
[k]

＠Martha
I am like this now because I lived through that time.[sr]That is what I was reflecting on.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Martha
...
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Martha
Since we are here, I shall draw up some water and have Master drink the commemorative first sip!
[k]


？1：I'm not that thirsty...

[charaFace G 5]
＠Martha
Don't say that, Master. Don't you remember what Mash said? You need to drink plenty because we're in the tropics.
[k]


？2：I want to drink Martha's holy water!

[charaFace G 4]
＠Martha
Just because I give you water, it doesn't mean it's holy!
[k]


？！

[charaFace G 1]
＠Martha
Here you go. Master, drink this and let's work hard for our next task!
