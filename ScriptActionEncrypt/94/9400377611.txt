Don't be ridiculous, Ibaraki.[sr]You're not above anything.

You're just a child pretending to be.[sr]You lacked the guts you needed to the very end.

[charaTalk B]

＠Sakata Kintoki
You really need someone to spell it out for you? I guess you do. Okay, Boss, would you kindly enlighten her?
[k]

？1：Basically, you never ate Shuten, did you?

？！

[charaFace C 2]


＠Ibaraki-Douji
Hargh[line 3]!?[sr]Y-You miserable human!
[k]


＠Ibaraki-Douji
How could you utter such a cruel suggestion!?[sr]Eat Shuten? I only said that in a hypothetical sense!
[k]



＠Ibaraki-Douji
And you took it literally... Do I really seem like someone who could eat Shuten!?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
I respect Shuten and haven't hurt so much as a hair upon her head, you fools! In the first place, I'd be too afraid to! She'd slaughter me!

Y-You little wretch, I don't know what you called me, but I can sense that it was some kind of dreadful insult. Wasn't it, human!?
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
What part of me do you dare to call weak!?[sr]Speak your name, knave!
[k]


？1：It's [%1].

？！

[charaFace C 2]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
All right, I've memorized it. I've memorized your name, human! I shall curse it to the end of time! Writhe in mortal terror!
[k]


[charaTalk A]



＠Mash
...Saying all that was perhaps a bit counter-productive... All the terror I felt for you before has been reversed. Right, Senpai?

[charaTalk B]


＠Sakata Kintoki
Jeez, you're actually pretty funny.[sr]Especially because your speech is so melodramatic!
[k]


[charaTalk C]
[charaFace C 3]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
I-I can hardly help that![sr]It is the custom of oni to speak in this way!
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Oni must be proud at all times, even in the way we speak! That's what my mother taught me!

Right, that's great.[sr]Just go on preserving those proud oni customs then.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
That's an oni's strong point and pride, isn't it?[sr]All right, what was this whole farce about?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
You capture an oni despite being an oni yourself, then serve humans alcohol hoping we'll self-destruct?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
That's not like you at all. It's because you drink more than you can handle. So go wash your face and come back again.

All right, then. I acknowledge it was my loss this time! And I'll acknowledge you humans' so-called guts!
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
But my horns remain unbroken! So next time you insult me, I will make you regret it deeply!
