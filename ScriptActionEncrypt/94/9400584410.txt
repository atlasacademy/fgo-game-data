＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I will not say much, Master.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Because no words... Not even by using my ears and tail could I completely express my feelings.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
But, even so, allow me to say one thing.[sr]Just one obvious thing.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Thank you very much, Master.[sr]Tamamo is truly fortunate.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Yes, of course! My tail and ears and have been quivering in delight this entire time!

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Ohh, this could compete with even the likes of the Fushimi Inari Shrine or the Ise Shrine.

That being the case, I feel I should bless you directly in return! I have always done so, but now even more so!
