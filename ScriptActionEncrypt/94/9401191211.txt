Well well, look at you being all aggressive!

＠Suzuka Gozen
Now this is what I'm talking about!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
A one-sided beatdown can be great for blowing off steam!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
But the best Servant fights are when you're REALLY all up in each other's business!

I gotta say, you've got some nice moves![sr]It's too bad you're stuck being a Sentinel!

[charaFace C 5]
＠Tamamo Cat
In fact, why ARE you a Sentinel? I only became one after I almost died, and had no other option...
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
Was it the same for you too? Or was it just you getting sick, like, from eating something off the ground, and BB taking you in and nursing you?

Of course not! She recruited me after seeing my totally fab winning streak!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
I have like, no clue what my Master looked like, but I know they were def someone who wanted to win the Holy Grail War!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
So what kind of Servant would I be if I didn't do my best to make that happen!?
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
I don't care about whatever BB's up to! All I care about is being the last Servant out of all 128[se ade44]...

Hi-hi, it's Suzuka. What's good, BB? Yeah, I'm here with the Chaldea crew right now, just like you said...
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Huh? You want me to head back to the temple?[sr]Don't fight them?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Suzuka Gozen
...Uh, and why the actual hell not?
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
I thought we were totes hype about the whole killing all the Servants thing. Was it just me?
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Why do they get special treatment?[sr]Now my wish will never come true.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Suzuka Gozen
...All in good time? Chaldea Servants don't count?[sr]Oh, okay... I guess that makes sense...
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
(...Sigh) Anyway, you've got some kind of plan in mind, right? Okay, okay...I got it.

Well, Cat, [%1], looks like we'll have to pick this up some other time.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Direct orders from the boss and all.[sr]I'm being a buzzkill, I know, but I gotta bounce.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
You're headed for the Command Room, right?[sr]Then I'd check out the Nape if I were you.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Though I'd also look around other places first.[sr]This place has all kinds of different stuff than the front.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Remember what I said before? It's not just BB's fault that Seraphix ended up like this.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
The humans here brought all this on themselves.[sr]This place was never just an oil rig.

I knew something fishy was going on. Looks like we're finally getting to the heart of the matter.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Unfortunately, it also looks like every facility around here has been completely SE.RA.PH-ized.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I did some digging around, and the front side has almost all the facilities an oil rig would need.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
So what around here could have prompted Suzuka Gozen to say that? And where would it be?

Hold up! Let's come back to that complicated stuff later, Master!
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
I almost forgot about it while fighting Suzuka, but we have to get back to the front side right now! Before something bad happens to Sir Gawain!
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
I know he doesn't look it, but he really is prone to getting into all kinds of trouble!

Don't be ridiculous.[sr]We'd just be wasting time if we went back there now.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
We should be taking advantage of this opportunity that Gawain has given us.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I say we get to an area near the Chest and turn the base back over.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
That way, we can reach the Central Command Room without having to fight that Alter Ego.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I'm pretty sure Gawain would agree if he were here.
[k]

？1：...Let's head to the Command Room for now.

？2：Are you okay with that, Meltryllis?
