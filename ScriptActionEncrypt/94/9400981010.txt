Yo, Boss. Somethin's been botherin' me since this morning.

Is today that Halloween festival thing again?

[charaFace A 3]
＠Sakata Kintoki
...Sheesh. I don't get it.[sr]All the women staff have been so restless...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Chocolate?[sr]You're givin' me some?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Kids get candy during Halloween.[sr]Take a good look at me. I ain't no kid.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
I get you thinkin' Ibaraki is a kid, 'cause she looks like one, but this is me we're talking about. ME.
[k]

？1：It's not Halloween.
？2：It's Valentine's Day.

？！

＠Sakata Kintoki

I figured givin' sweets in return for getting' sweets is the most GOLDEN thing to do. But my room ain't got anything like that to give you, Boss.

[charaFace A 3]
＠Sakata Kintoki
Forgive me, but these are all I got.[sr]Accept 'em if ya like.

＠Sakata Kintoki
If ya like it, put it on.[sr]That way, we'll both have matchin' emblems!
