...That Santa made us sign some weird form[sr]and then put our stamp on it...
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
...and the next thing we knew we were forced to[sr]buy expensive presents with our own money...
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Martha
That's not all. When they found out we didn't have[sr]enough money, they confiscated our stuff!
[k]

＠Martha
What is that? Some kind of new sales technique?[sr]When did Santa Claus turn into a shady company?

Come to think of it... Santa Alter's wearing black.[sr]I didn't realize that she was Santa Claus at first.

Kids might think she's a mean Santa, but objectively[sr]speaking, she punishes evil kids so they'll mend their ways.

I have no intention on lecturing anyone.[sr]If you want one, you can ask an Avenger.

＠Santa Alter
Anyway, I'm sorry that happened to you. Let me see...[sr]I didn't expect to need presents for three people.
