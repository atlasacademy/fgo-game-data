You've finally come.
[k]

？1：She looks familiar...
？2：Nobody would ever forget that figure!
？！

[charaFace D 3]

＠Medusa
M-Master!?[sr]Why are you here!?
[k]

＠Medusa
This is...well, this was not part of the plan.

＠Pārvatī
Yes. It's sort of...an object that acts as an anchor to maintain my existence. That Spiritron Dress should naturally be in my possession.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
But for some reason, the moment I manifested, I realized I didn't have it, and that it was somewhere else entirely.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
So I went looking for it by following its scent.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Pārvatī
And when you sense that someone else is wearing your precious clothes...
[k]

＠Pārvatī
You would never want to give them up, and go on a journey to find them, no matter what. Do you understand that feeling?

Well...you see...
[k]

＠Medusa
It is difficult to explain my actions...even for me.
[k]

＠Medusa
After all, what I've done here was motivated by a sort of impulse that bubbled up from somewhere within me. But...at least half of my goal is accomplished now.

I see. So it was part of your plan to be found.[sr]So what is the other half of your goal?

＠Medusa
While some may argue otherwise, I would say that I am doing what I am because we are both goddesses. I'm not certain myself, but my gut tells me...
[k]

＠Medusa
...there's no need for you to fight if it means you have to use THAT vessel.
[k]

＠Medusa
And since you've just became a Servant, hitting you with a sufficiently powerful Spiritual attack may cleave you apart from your vessel.
[k]

＠Medusa
Doing so may entirely negate your[sr]existence as a Pseudo-Servant.
[k]

＠Medusa
So there's no reason for me not to try it.[sr]My Spirit Core is compelling me to try...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

＠Medusa
Now, please...
[k]

＠Medusa
Please return to the realm of the gods. I have nothing against you personally, but brace yourself!

It looks like we can't talk this out.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
I may not understand your reasoning, but I can see that you are resolved to do this. But...
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Pārvatī
I also have a purpose for being here,[sr]so I cannot allow myself to be sent away so easily.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
So, I will defend myself!
