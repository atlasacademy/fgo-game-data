Hiiiya!

＠Cleopatra
Hello, Master who continuously fights in the distant land of Chaldea and spends [&his:her] days off all by [&his:her] lonesome.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
Yes, you! [%1]![sr]I'm talking about you, [%1]!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cleopatra
Cleopatra VII Philopator has arrived in all her fabulousness, ready for the occasion!
[k]

＠Cleopatra
And it seems we have just so happened to run into each other! What fortuitous coincidence!
[k]

＠Cleopatra
This must be destiny![sr]Though you are a mere contractor to me!
[k]

？1：Um, yes. Hello.
？2：This is My Room...

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Cleopatra
Yes, that is right. Compared to my room, it is so sparse and simple... It makes me sad.

“If you were to contract with me, you must always be hip and fashion-forward!”
[k]

＠Cleopatra
“You don't have to be covered in gold and jewels, but you should have at least ONE brand-name item.”
[k]

＠Cleopatra
That was my warning, yet you have done nothing! Know that my heart is filled with sorrow...way beyond worry!

But I am not so cruel as to force someone to do what is beyond their capacity. I am, after all, a pharaoh.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
People have good traits and bad traits.[sr]And so, this is my gift to you:
[k]

＠Cleopatra
A blessing from the Nile that is sure to light up this tragically dreary room. This is a truly superior masterpiece!

Yes, of course! I stuffed it with all of my favorite things! Of course it's good!

And your comment is so spot-on it's commendable![sr][%1]! Thank you!

Now... Having given you this, I can now make you my subordinate, right?
[k]

＠Cleopatra
I say subordinate, but not like as a slave.[sr]I mean more like keeping you trapped as my lover.
[k]

？1：???
？2：You've got Valentine's Day all wrong...

＠Cleopatra
“Valentine's Day is not a day where the giver of the gift makes the call, but rather the one receiving the gift is the one who makes the call.” ...I see.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Cleopatra
That is a rule and custom wholly unfamiliar to me...[sr]This is exceedingly complicated...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Cleopatra
But, now that I know, this still shouldn't be an issue.[sr]I will just leave it up to you.
[k]

？1：Me?

？！

＠Cleopatra
Yes. Please escort me to a lovely viewing spot perfect for enjoying these fruits.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
But it's best to go somewhere that isn't crowded.
[k]

＠Cleopatra
Why? Because you and I are going to be feeding each other these fruits in a loving, sensual way!
