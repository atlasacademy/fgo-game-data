＠B：???
[line 3]Have you ever envied someone?
[k]

＠B：???
Have you ever faced someone with the talent, opportunity, and riches that you lacked, and knelt down before them in defeat?
[k]

＠B：???
This world is rife with inequality, and so we shed our tears as we ruminate on the sanctity of fairness. Have you experienced that?
[k]

＠B：???
Do not answer. There is no need for you to.
[k]

＠B：???
Peer inside your heart. Do not turn your eyes from what you see. For that is what every heart holds. None can escape it.
[k]

＠B：???
It is what leads us to covet and begrudge one another, then shed tears of regret.
[k]

＠B：???
The sin of envy.

Um, is something the matter?

？1：Why do you ask?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
Oh, it's just... You suddenly stopped walking and broke off in mid-speech.
[k]

＠Mash
You just kept standing there in silence, so I thought maybe something was worrying you...
[k]

Good morning.[sr]I mean[line 3]

Senpai, were you doing your special move, the REM REM Trance? As in, sleeping while standing?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I was wondering if that was the case since you suddenly stopped walking and broke off mid-speech...
[k]

？！

＠Mash
Your expression sort of looked vacant too.[sr]Are you not feeling well?
[k]

？1：I haven't noticed anything.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Oh, okay... Just in case, let's go get you a medical check-up.
[k]

？2：Just daydreaming?

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
It's possible. Let's get you checked out in case it was caused by magecraft.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
First, let's get you to your room, Senpai.[sr]I'll call the Doctor over[line 3]

＠B：???
Welcome to the Prison Tower on the Isle of Despair, Senpai!
[k]

＠B：???
Sinner by the name of [%1]! This is a place beyond love and hate, thus any soul may be imprisoned here!
[k]

＠B：???
You are no exception.
[k]

？1：...I'm in Chaldea.

＠B：???
Chaldea? No. You are certainly not.[sr]Ha, ha, ha, your beloved little friend is not here.
[k]

＠B：???
And neither is that meddlesome Doctor, nor that pervert who is so pleased with his own body's modification. You are the only one here.
[k]

＠B：???
...Though, of course, I am here too.
[k]

？2：...Who are you?

＠B：???
A Heroic Spirit who does not belong in this world.[sr]To borrow a phrase from your adorable friend.
[k]

＠B：???
A name comes to mind, does it not?[sr]Or have you already forgotten?
[k]

＠B：???
That is fine. Forget it all. Only a vengeful soul would seek to carve all things indelible upon itself.

Oh, that's right[line 3] Did you find that First Tower fun? No, it's all right. Don't speak. I don't actually wish to hear your opinions.
[k]

＠B：???
It was but an automatic reflex of hospitality. Like an involuntary reply to someone calling out your name.
[k]

＠B：???
The Second Tower welcomes you.[sr]Do enjoy it to its fullest extent.

See, they are all coming out to greet you. It seems they don't find the warm pulse of your soul likable.
[k]

＠B：???
It may not be like the First Tower, but a large number of dead souls have congregated here as well.
[k]

＠B：???
They seem severely agitated, don't they?[sr]They're resentful. And envious.
[k]

＠B：???
Of you! You, who stands in this room and yet still lives!
[k]

？1：They're going to attack me?!
？2：...That's totally unreasonable!

？！

＠B：???
Haha, calm yourself, Master.[sr]There are so many things you still need to know.
[k]

＠B：???
For instance, where, exactly, are you right now?[sr]And who am I?
[k]

＠B：???
That said, most of the information that awaits you will be quite trivial, but...you can at least learn one thing of importance.
[k]

＠B：???
For instance... Yes, the ugliness of you humans[line 3]
