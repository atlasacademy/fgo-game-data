We're almost at this area's final zone[line 2]the one assigned to the Sentinel...
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Do you really plan on having that Servant join us?[sr]Killing her would be a lot less trouble.

Agreed. If you can't depend on someone to be reliable, you can't call them a true ally.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
In my opinion, allies who don't work well with others, or who don't know how to read social cues, are a lot more trouble than tough opponents.
[k]

？1：Pot calling the kettle black, much?

？2：Uh-huh. So...why did you come along this time?

＠Emiya Alter
I heard you'd be going up against a Sentinel. I've been wanting to see how strong they are for myself.

Be that as it may, the more options at our disposal, the better. I myself would be hard-pressed to fend off a cadre of enemy Archers on my own.

On a different note, milady: would you mind telling us exactly what a Sentinel is?
[k]

＠Gawain
I was under the impression that every Sentinel was an Alter Ego, and vice versa...

It's true that we Alter Egos were originally salvaged in order to be made into Sentinels.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
But a Sentinel doesn't have to be an Alter Ego.[sr]BB can turn anyone she likes into one.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
It's more of a de facto class, really. All she needs is a Spirit Origin that can handle a Karmaphage.

Karmaphage... So the “phage” part refers to “bacteriophage”[line 2]a virus.
[k]


＠Emiya Alter
I never would've guessed that kind of power was like an infectious disease. Suits you Alter Egos well.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Meltryllis
What do you mean by that?[sr]What do you know about us, anyway?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Emiya Alter
You're avatars that BB made out of her emotions, right?
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Basically, you're a patchwork of Spirit Origins made from multiple Servants... multiple goddess essences.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Inhuman murder dolls whose very existence cheats the system.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
...
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
What, no comeback? And here I thought the patchwork remark would've offended your sense of aesthetics.
[k]

Not at all. I'm impressed by how well you understand us.

＠Meltryllis
Yes, we Alter Egos are cheat Spirit Origins. We were monsters tied to five emotions that BB cut off from herself, deemed unnecessary for a perfect AI...
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Love & hate, pleasure, innocence, yearning, benevolence.
[k]

？1：Five emotions...?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
That's right. That said, they're specifically emotions directed at a particular target.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
As the Alter Ego of pleasure, I was created to ensure my target would enjoy the very finest pleasure.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Of course, now I can choose my own target.[sr]Once I do, they won't know what hit them.
[k]

？2：What do you mean “were”...?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
Everything this smug Archer said is in the past now.[sr]We've grown and evolved since then.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Meltryllis
We used to hate being so beholden to our emotions, but not anymore. We've learned to face them head on.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
We may not be able to become human, but we are trying to understand how they feel.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
And we're happy remaining as Alter Egos.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
As long as there's even one human out there who accepts us as we are, we don't mind being monsters.

Of course. They're everywhere. Humans turned out to be much more accepting than we thought.

I'm picking up some serious feels around here!

I mean, it makes sense that the tension would escalate in what's clearly a boss stage, but...
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
But my keen feline nose smells some drama going on around here without me!
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
Let me guess, Master. You're thinking bad things.[sr]Like how you don't need any more Servants.
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
Or how having more around would just be a big pain, so you may as well defeat this lost kitty and be done with it. Am I right?
[k]

？1：Don't worry. We're here to defeat you.

[charaFace D 2]
＠Tamamo Cat
Oh, okay. I get the context now![sr]Can't say I'm happy about it! See? Tail's not wagging!

O-oh. I guess you like doing things the hard way, don't you.

The head of the fish went to cut the grass. The obligation of this society went to wash clothes. The dog, the monkey, and the pheasant can all go straight to hell.

Yep! No doubt about it! Felines are a primate's best friend! Sentinel Cat, launching!

I'll tell you this right now, Saber and Archer! You're gonna have a rough time of it here on SE.RA.PH if you can't figure out how to read the room!
