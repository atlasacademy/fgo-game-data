It appears as though most of the other racers have dropped out. Few things are better than stains that easily come out in the wash.

A predictable outcome. This course is a melting pot of heat and passion, just like my own Vesuvius.

Rome may delight in all manner of entertainment, but even we Romans do not usually race on an active volcano more than once a decade at most!

＠Nero
I, of course, have already raced on such a course, so I am well aware of the necessary techniques! It is all but impossible for neophytes to any hope of keeping up!
