＠Kayneth
I see. Observing the past projected on the Earth Environmental Model, and the Rayshift technology that implemented the Heroic Spirit Summoning System...
[k]

＠Kayneth
And all of this is made possible by the use of the Spiritron Calculation Engine.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Kayneth
Spiritron Calculation Engine... I'd heard rumors that the Atlas Institute was working on such a thing, but...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
Yes. All of these great achievements in magecraft are accomplished by the Archibald family.

Of course, this is only possible due to your astonishing leadership. Your later exploits at the Clock Tower...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
...bring together a number of different academic factions to make this huge project, “Chaldea,” a reality.

Well, I was just thinking that the Evocation department and Mineralogy department weren't enough for me to get the upper hand in the academic world.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Kayneth
I was thinking perhaps it was time to find some new research. Yes. I'm surprised I had such skills in that direction, though.

Hmm. I guess even in my old age I can still pull off some new tricks, huh?

Of course, it's not only your technological achievements, but the financial backing provided by the Sophia-Ri clan.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
The vast amount of funds required for Chaldea was only available due to the loving relationship you have with your future wife.

Aww, shucks. Hehe. I've dedicated my whole life to magecraft, so I don't know if I could be a family man...

And so we've come here to make your future glory all the more certain, Lord Archibald.

＠El-Melloi
But time travel brings with it certain restrictions on what you can do in the past.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
We can't offer you too much aid, but when it comes to information...
[k]

＠Kayneth
Yes, with your intervention, I'll have the advantage over the enemy at all stages in the process.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
The first thing you must do is eliminate Caster.[sr]The other Masters don't know where he is.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠El-Melloi
If you can launch an attack first, the additional Command Spell the Overseer promised will be yours.

Please just keep in mind that such possibility cannot be ignored.

＠El-Melloi
We can only speak to events that have already been decided when it comes to our intervention.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
We must remain silent about anything that has not been observed by anyone in this temporal axis.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Otherwise, the ripples caused by the change of history will grow too great, and may activate the Counter Force.
[k]

＠Kayneth
Hmph...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Our very intervention has caused the future to change and lose its certainty.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
What happens now is unknown to us as well.
[k]

＠Kayneth
These secret spells enter the realm of True Magic, and so they aren't that easy to use, huh? So I guess it all depends on how you use them.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
We're almost at Caster's workshop.[sr]This is where it gets rough.

He has a powerful Noble Phantasm, but is weak as a mage. However, in large numbers these things pose a threat.
