I can't believe I didn't realize this pre-SE.RA.PH equipment was still functioning.

That's exactly it. “Pre-SE.RA.PH.”

Anyway, it's not functioning anymore.[sr]So, we can start with our exploration of[line 2]

No [charaFadein D 0.1 1]need for that, members of Chaldea. You want to go to the front side, right? Then let's get started.

＠Robin Hood
Yeah, yeah. Save the meta-banter, would you?[sr]I'm not even here to fight.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
I've got a message from BB. Uh...something, something, “can't possibly beat Lip”...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
...or, uh... “If you keep to your plan, you'll get pancaked,” maybe?
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Okay, yeah this is kind of annoying, so broad strokes: “Passionlip is waiting for you on the front side.”
[k]

＠Robin Hood
“You can't possibly beat her the way you would any normal enemy, so just give up and submit to me, BB.”
[k]

＠Robin Hood
You can figure the rest out for yourselves, yeah?

Eh...it's BB. I guess she developed some secret weapon that can break the “shackles on her heart” or something.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
She also said you could use that to remove Lip's restraints. Man, she can be a real pain.

Hmph, thanks for the warning. She's probably planning on taking us for all our Sakurament again.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Emiya Alter
So then what? What do we get for beating Passionlip?
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
If she's waiting for us there, we can just try somewhere else. There's really no point in fighting a monster like her.

Regardless, you guys don't have much choice in the matter. She's a Sentinel, after all.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
As long as she and her kind are around, you won't be able to move freely around SE.RA.PH.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Sooner or later, you'll have to deal with her.[sr]Of course, you could always just give in now and punish her for[line 3]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Robin Hood
Actually, no, there's no need for that. I'm not actually acting out of malice or messing around this time, see...

[charaFace D 1]
＠Robin Hood
Anyway, you know that tickling hand thing?[sr]BB told me to hold on to it.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Once you're ready to fight Passionlip, let me know and I'll take you to the front side.
