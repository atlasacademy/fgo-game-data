Yo, Master, what the hell's going on!?[sr]What's a giant mechanical little girl doing outside?

Oh, right, she's not really little anymore, is she?[sr]So, just plain old giant mechanical dragon girl then?

I ordered all the parts from Amazones.com and modified her as best as I could, but I guess I messed up somewhere...

I'm a busy mecha. Since you have the Holy Grail, I'd like to get this over with as soon as possible.

...Yes. I want you to provide me with perpetual security so I can laze around here forever. EIEN NI. So give all these people the boot so I can get to it.

While we are different versions, I share in Mk. I's humiliation. I will see to it that I succeed where she failed so embarrassingly.
