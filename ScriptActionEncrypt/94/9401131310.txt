Mr. Hijikata... Why...?

＠Nobunaga
It's simple. That Hijikata Toshizo guy is also a Heroic Spirit that the Demon God Pillar summoned.
[k]

＠Nobunaga
...Am I right?

...After hearing your conversation, it seems that way.
[k]

＠Hijikata Toshizo
On that fateful day, I was shot at Hakodate...and the next thing I knew, I was here. Does that mean the Demon God Pillar consumed me, too?

＠Nobunaga
Not necessarily. That thing called out for those who share its desires, and maintained this space.
[k]

＠Nobunaga
You're just one of the keystones that made this space, all the while being a Rogue Servant who didn't need the power of the Demon God Pillar.
[k]

＠Nobunaga
If it had consumed you, I'm sure this place would have been a much more hellish battlefield.
[k]

＠Nobunaga
Anyway! Your version of immortality doesn't seem to quite match up with the Demon God Pillar's.
[k]

＠Nobunaga
Isn't that right, Hijikata? You're the epitome of stubborn refusal to back down. Besides, you're not the kind of wuss who'd let someone else control your Spirit Origin.

Heh. I suppose I should be honored to get a seal of approval from the lord of the Sengoku period.

＠Hijikata Toshizo
Oh hey. Now that I've got a good look at you,[sr]I can see you're quite a beauty.

Actually, if we can just talk Mr. Hijikata down, this'll sort itself out, and he'll come back to his senses, right?

＠Nobunaga
That's not possible. Even the Demon God Pillar couldn't release the man from madness.
[k]

＠Nobunaga
Hey, Hijikata... You didn't even realize you turned into a Heroic Spirit after you died, did you?
[k]

＠Nobunaga
You wandered that strange battlefield, all that time projecting your desires toward the Grail[line 2]toward the Demon God Pillar.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Nobunaga
The whole time, all you were thinking was:[sr]“I can't die here. I won't be killed until I win.”

Probably. The Grail grants people's wishes. As the one who wished on it, his desire was what shaped that realm.

You're all trapped here until I die.

So be it. If you're ready to live and die by that belief, then rest assured, you'll have no mercy from me!
