＠Altria
I've been searching for you, Master.
[k]

＠Altria
I have learned everything there is to know about Valentine's Day. Bedivere has taught me everything.
[k]

＠Altria
I can see that all of Chaldea has livened up. Indeed, a festival is something that enriches the human soul.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Altria
Would you mind if I joined in the festivities?
[k]

？1：Please do!

[charaFace A 0]

＠Altria
Wonderful. Well then...
[k]

？2：Of course, my king.

[charaFace A 0]

＠Altria
Master, you are not one of my knights. And above all else, a festival is a time to do away with formalities.
[k]

＠Altria
For the time being, I am neither king, nor a knight...
[k]

＠Altria
I am no more than a reveler participating in the festivities. And I shall say this one thing:
[k]


？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Altria
...Happy Valentine's Day, Master.
[k]



＠Altria
To the one who fights for the sake of the world, I give you my blessings. To the one who allows me to properly wield Rhongomyniad, I wish to express gratitude.
[k]

＠Altria
Please accept this.[sr]This is my chocolate for you.

＠Altria
That...is what I had wanted to say, and then present you with the chocolate.
[k]

＠Altria
But, actually, I do not have it on my person...[sr]That is, I do have it prepared, but...
[k]

＠Altria
But it's not something that can be easily carried.[sr]My apologies, I seem to have gone overboard with it.
[k]

？1：I see. Don't tell me...
？2：Is it a GIANT chocolate!?

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Altria
Yes. You have a keen eye, Master.
[k]

＠Altria
I figured that if I must prepare something that would convey my emotions, I should put my entire spirit into it.
[k]

＠Altria
So that's what I did.[sr]As a result, it became quite...grand in scale.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Altria
It was so large, I was worried I wouldn't finish in time on my own. But it was, fortunately, completed in time.

＠Altria
The Knights of the Round Table helped me. Surprising, as our relationship is no longer that of lord and vassals.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Altria
...Regardless, they were of great help.
[k]

＠Altria
In making it. And in transporting it.
[k]

＠Altria
It is remarkably large, so I have no other choice but to deliver it to your room. A few of the Knights of the Round Table will deliver it tonight.
[k]

？1：Looking forward to it.
？2：Why don't we all eat it together?

？！

＠Altria
You are right. I'm sure the Knights of the Round Table will be delighted.
[k]

＠Altria
A festival like this should be enjoyed with a crowd.
[k]
