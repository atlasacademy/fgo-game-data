Oh...how satisfying.[sr]It's been ages since I danced like that.
[k]

？1：What incredible strength!
？2：Alter Egos can be...really dangerous.

？！

＠Meltryllis
Oh my. I'm sorry if I made it hard on you.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
But considering the opponents you've yet to face, it's probably for the best.

...Why are you sitting there?[sr]Did you not just tell us that we have no time?

＠Tristan
Should we not start looking for a route to the surface and find the planetarium that powers SE.RA.PH?

We're on the underside of the Portopia Thigh.[sr]This is my domain. Here, let me show you.

That's the church right there.[sr]Rest up a bit before we head to the planetarium.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
I'll stay here.[sr]I can't move anymore.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
I don't want to be a burden. Just leave me. My usefulness pretty much ended when we unlocked the Core anyway.
[k]

？1：...You leave me with no choice.
？2：...Sorry about this.

HEY! Watch out! Have you lost your mind!?[sr]My legs...they'll tear you up if you give me a piggyback.

...Indeed. We are stopping by the church anyway, so it will be no trouble at all to carry you there.

＠Tristan
Does an Alter Ego's life force not exceed a Servant's? If it does, then resting in the church will help you recover.

That's...true, but... Okay, I suppose you're right.[sr]The church is the best place to rest.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
I won't stop you, but...be careful,[sr][%1].
[k]

＠Meltryllis
...My body is quite hard and, um, spiky in places.[sr]My knees, for instance. Try not to touch them...
