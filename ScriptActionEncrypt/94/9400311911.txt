Why aren't you still on the ground?[sr]It looks like you're still breathing, but...

That can happen. Dead, but not really dead.[sr]You see, resurrection is my special ability.

Ah, never mind. This isn't the time to bring that up.

I know about you people. You're the ones who destroyed the Greater Grail along with that Counter Force fellow.

Y-Yes. Do you know about Senpai?

I do. I observed your Master fighting for a bit from the best seat in the house. So, anyway, what?

Hello, Mash and [%1].[sr]Good work.
[k]

＠The Dress of Heaven
I'm the Dress of Heaven. I'm a different entity than Irisviel, with whom you were working until just a while ago[line 3]

Simply put, I'm like the spirit of the Greater Grail.

[%1]. Listen closely, for this is your group's problem as well.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠The Dress of Heaven
You destroyed the black Holy Grail. That's fine.[sr]I don't mind. Even though it was painful.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠The Dress of Heaven
But to be honest, that was a mistake.[sr]You shouldn't have done it.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_1 1.0]

＠The Dress of Heaven
The reason is[line 3]
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_3 0.1]

[charaFace B 2]
＠The Dress of Heaven
The reason is, the way you destroyed it was too lenient!
[k]

＠The Dress of Heaven
You should've done it more thoroughly! For example, you could've blown it up together with one floor of a luxury hotel!
[k]

？1：Spoken like a rock star!

I'm saying you were too naive. You didn't completely destroy the black Holy Grail.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠The Dress of Heaven
You broke the vessel in a clumsy manner.[sr]As a result, the Lesser Grail...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠The Dress of Heaven
Irisviel was broken into shards and scattered. Each of those shards has begun working independently.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠The Dress of Heaven
They are[line 3][sr]Fire Iri, Water Iri, Earth Iri, and Wind Iri!
[k]

？1：The four elements of Irisviel!
？2：That's too many.

Exactly. Four of them are too much to handle.[sr]I tried to get them to calm down...
[k]

＠Avenger
...But I was just wasting my breath, as they attacked me.
[k]

＠The Dress of Heaven
Yes. Like the original Irisviel, the four split-up elements would be kind under normal circumstances.
[k]

＠The Dress of Heaven
But Fire Iri, who is particularly extreme, rose up in revolt.
[k]

？1：Fire Iri?

Yes. And like leaping flames, the other Iris were awakened to their violent side.
[k]

＠The Dress of Heaven
Sad to say... but even after gaining their freedom and individual personalities, their grudge against you didn't disappear.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠The Dress of Heaven
Do you understand, [%1]?[sr]Your war isn't over yet.
[k]

＠The Dress of Heaven
Four types of Irisviel, let loose in Fuyuki.[sr]You have a responsibility and a duty to defeat them.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠The Dress of Heaven
They're, how can I put it... Anyway, persistent, immune to discouragement, and obstinate.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠The Dress of Heaven
I'm sure they'll come back after you beat them.[sr]But please stick with them until the job is done.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠The Dress of Heaven
Besides, it looks like that gloomy, yet shy, sensitive, and handsome man... [charaFace B 0]Ahem. I mean, the hooded assassin has gone back.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠The Dress of Heaven
In the first place, that man isn't suited for this kind of job, right?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠The Dress of Heaven
I'm asking you as a favor, on behalf of Avenger.
[k]

＠The Dress of Heaven
Assassin... Save the city of Fuyuki instead of him.[sr]Only you people can do this job.
[k]

？1：Sure. Leave it to us.
