＠Emiya Alter
That's right. This is the heart of Seraphix:[sr]the Celestial Body Simulator, System Animusphere.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
This is where the Master candidates, met their fate. The Demon God Pillar used them to summon the 128 Servants.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
After the Demon God Pillar took root in Seraphix, it learned of the existence of this abandoned planetarium.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Oh, how it must have laughed...being able to use THIS, of all places...
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
The world within the Coffins is ruled by uncertainty.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
No matter how long it's been since the mages within died, as long as the Coffins are powered, their occupants can be used endlessly as biological circuits.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
The 128 Servants were summoned by the corpses in this planetarium.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
This happened countless times, again and again without pause, until you came to help.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
But it's over now.[sr]I just destroyed the Coffins' power source.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
And now, there will be no more summoning here. These Masters were neither living nor dead, but they can finally rest in peace.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Now, so can you, [%1].[sr]SE.RA.PH has no need of Masters.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Everyone aware of this planetarium's existence...

I will eradicate all traces of this evil. I will remove any possibility of a repeat of this tragedy.

This is the sole reason I live, and the reason why[line 2]

“And that is why you've snuffed out so many lives.[sr]And this, too, will be no exception.”
