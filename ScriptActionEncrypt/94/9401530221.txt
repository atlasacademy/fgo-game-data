What's going on here!?

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
701, newcomers, I don't know what sort of sport you were engaging in here, but it looks to be incredibly dangerous.
[k]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
I want you to stop it right now, then let me examine you.
[k]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
If any of you are injured...I will have you come to the infirmary immediately.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
Don't worry. My infirmary is far stricter about keeping patients in bed than solitary confinement.
[k]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
It's also far more effective than the scaffold at silencing patients' screams. Now, let's take a look at you, shall we?

You see, Medb is so supremely confident in her Prison Field that she's failed to pay attention to anything else.

And that means she still has blind spots.

If you could find a gap in the barrier...somewhere it doesn't reach, or maybe just a route the wardens would never expect you to take, then maybe, just maybe...

Once they're out, I'll have each team reacquire their vehicles from the warehouse outside the barrier, get back to the course, and burn rubber for the finish line!

Admittedly, I'm not quite sure where this'll go, but I'll make sure that the time it takes each team to escape is reflected in their final results.
