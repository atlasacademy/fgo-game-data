Of course! Master has an A Rank in Endurance, and will listen to even the ramblings of a wild cat with patience!

＠Tamamo Cat Woof
However. However...![messageShake 0.05 4 4 0.7] This cat is ticked!
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat Woof
I've been carefully getting ready for a nice traditional New Year's meal since the end of last year...
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat Woof
I was willing to skip the last battle for it.[sr]Honestly, being an all-star is so annoying.
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat Woof
So I was peeling my shrimp, resolved to duck out of any battles...

[charaFace C 4]
＠Tamamo Cat Woof
When Master... Master... Master ordered the New Years meal at a convenience store!
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat Woof
And [&he:she] even ordered one for me! So considerate![sr]But that turned out to just really make me angry!

＠Sukeroku
Ah... That's no good. Don't you know why New Year's meals are so elaborate, kid?
[k]

＠Sukeroku
They're made of food that lasts so that the lady of the house doesn't have to cook for three days straight.
[k]

＠Sukeroku
And they're made elaborately and lovingly with as many of the husband's favorite foods as possible. It's their way of showing their gratitude at the end of the year.

Yes... They say New Year's Day dictates the rest of the year, you know. So traditionally for the wife, pleasing her significant other with a homemade New Year's meal...
[k]

＠Musashi
...is a way to infuse the relationship with love, spirit, joy, and mutual support for the whole year ahead!
[k]

＠Musashi
And you just went out and got a store-bought one...? Even my jerk dad gets quiet in front of a New Year's meal...
