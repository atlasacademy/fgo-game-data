Indeed. I hate to say it, but Dumuzid only became a god after acquiring Authority. Before that, he was King of Uruk; his reign came between King Lugalbanda's and mine.

At any rate, Dumuzid's greatest weakness was a lust for glory.

Little did he know that Ishtar would shortly cause an incident that would drive everyone mad.

＠Gilgamesh
“Ishtar's Descent to the Underworld”...[sr]The story of Ishtar's defeat at Ereshkigal's hands.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
After she lost her life in the underworld, the surface fell into a panic.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
You see, Ishtar was the goddess of fertility, as she inherited her father's Authority over the harvest.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
So with her suddenly gone, crops were bound to fail.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
...What a pain she is. She causes chaos when she's alive, and even dead she makes no end of trouble.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
She is, as they say in the human world, the sort we cannot live with, nor without. She's basically a fortune stone too powerful for humans to use.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
At any rate, the wise god Enki resurrected her body using the grass and water of life.

As the ruler of the underworld, I cannot simply let anyone go between here and the surface as they please.

Her body may be restored, but her soul remains under my domain. That's not changing, no matter what sort of gifts you try to ply me with.

Part of her acutely feels the weight of the responsibility her divinity confers, while another part enjoys it, and yet another respects it.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Gilgamesh
All that aside, Ereshkigal really had no desire to destroy the surface world.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
If anything, having Ishtar running around the underworld was nothing but a nuisance.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
So the Queen of Kur set the Queen of Heaven free, though only temporarily.

No, she did not. She may be rash and impetuous, but she is still fundamentally good.

More importantly, her pride would not permit another to save her life.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
So, until and unless someone gladly volunteered to give her their soul of their own volition...
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
...she would never let someone else take her place.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Furthermore, her sacred prostitutes were the only ones who were truly willing to trade their lives for hers.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
And not even Ishtar would willingly sacrifice one of her own servants.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Gilgamesh
Thus, Ishtar resigned herself to her fate and headed back to the underworld...but not before making one final stop at her city, Uruk.

There, she saw her husband mourning the loss of his wife.

Both Nergal and Dumuzid returned to the surface,[sr]which means there must be a way to get back.

So why did Ereshkigal stay in the underworld?
[k]

＠Altera Santa
In Sumerian myth, did she truly stay in the underworld all her life, without ever once going to the surface?
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

If she were ever to venture to the surface, the underworld as we know it would be destroyed.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
For better or worse, she cared for the underworld far more than necessary. She trusted her love more than her desires.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Thanks to her devotion, Uruk's underworld remained peaceful and orderly.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
She would never abandon her duty merely because it was hard. That was the greatest Authority she possessed.

＠Gilgamesh
Do you understand, Santa?

She was the only one who could manage the great feat of ruling the underworld in all its frigidity.

And that concludes our in-flight movie and Santa's second illustrated story. I hope you enjoyed it.

[charaFace B 8]

＠Altera Santa
...I see. I'm sorry my story wasn't clearer.[sr]I was afraid this might happen...

I must have inadvertently polished it too much, and taken it to the realm of high literature...
[k]

？1：No, no, I understood it fine. It's just, why...?
？2：No, what I don't get is why she's attacking us.

？！

[charaFace B 0]

＠Altera Santa
...Good question. Even in Sumerian myth, Ereshkigal doesn't seem like a bad god at all.
[k]

？1：And there's no reason why she would do this.

？！

＠Altera Santa
You know...that's a good point.[sr]Ereshkigal DOESN'T have a reason to do this.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
So, if not her, then who is attacking Chaldea?
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Do you have any idea, [%1]?
[k]

？1：Maybe...Nergal?

＠C：???
Well done. That is the logical conclusion to this story, after all, since it concerns who gets to rule the underworld.
[k]

？2：...Dumuzid seems very suspicious...

＠C：???
Oh yes, Dumuzid is part of this too. But he wouldn't do anything unless there was something in it for him.

Sometimes I like to toss out the odd spoiler, too.[sr]After all, I'm not on Nergal's side either.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Mister Sheep
Nergal is the one attacking your base and holding Ereshkigal prisoner.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Well, more accurately, it's less him and more the malice he left behind in the underworld.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Now that the gods have left Mesopotamia, they can't materialize unless humans explicitly summon them.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Mister Sheep
I swear, I can't tell if he's just that resilient, or that hell-bent (no pun intended) on holding a grudge.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Usually he wouldn't amount to more than a pile of residual thoughts wandering around the underworld, but with Ereshkigal weakened, I suppose he decided to bet it all on one last move.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
He's trying to steal Ereshkigal's rulership of the underworld and reign supreme as a god once again.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
The age of Nergal, god of the sun, is long over.[sr]But Nergal, god of the underworld? Maybe not.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Unlike Mesopotamia, the underworld is still alive and kicking, so to speak, so if he can become its god, he can take the place over.
[k]

？1：Easy with the spoilers!
？2：I knew it. It IS you, isn't it, Merl...?
