＠Sessyoin Kiara
Oh my, Master. No wonder I couldn't find you...[sr]You've been here the whole time.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Do you have a moment? Yes?[sr]Ah, wonderful.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
You may find this hard to believe,[sr]but I have been searching high and low for you.
[k]

[charaFace B 11]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Since the early hours of the morning, in fact. I have not even used my devilish sight...only my own eyes.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
That is why it has taken so long, you see. But that is in the past, now, and I can express my exasperation at another time.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
You see, today is one of those wonderfully rare days where even I am surprised at how excited I become...
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
It has been so exhilarating, searching for[sr]someone for whom I hold such great affection.
[k]

？1：Um...what's exhilarating, exactly?
？2：Kiara, are you feeling all right?

？！

[charaFace B 3]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
H-how heartless of you...
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
An insult from my dearest [%1]...[sr]Mmm, this new sensation...
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Ah...no, that is not what I am here to do. I swore that I would remain calm and composed today, as on a bright spring day.
[k]

[charaFace B 13]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Oh, please, pleeease have mercy on me, Master.[sr]Please do try not to disgrace me.
[k]

[charaFace B 10]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
I know I must not look it, but I am still not wholly in control, you see...and so...something may cause me to break the vow we made.
[k]

？1：Then could it be...?

？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Yes. It is Valentine's Day!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
I wanted so much to praise your incredible self-control, your discipline. This is only a small thing, but you see,[sr]I wanted to do something to show my admiration.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Does that surprise you? Hehe... I am not the sort of woman who is so dense as to let opportunities like this slip through my fingers.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
So please, take this. It seems like it has been so long since I did something for such purely selfish reasons...

Yes. You might think I have turned over a new leaf...[sr]You would be wrong. But, as I thought so intently of you while I worked, well...this was the result.
[k]

[charaFace B 10]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
It may not stand in comparison with the cute things others have made for you, but these are the sweets I most enjoy. They make me happiest.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
I might have grabbed your heartstrings in an[sr]iron grip had I made chocolates you enjoyed...
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
...but for the time being, I wished you to know what I myself enjoyed. ...Was that not appropriate?
[k]

？1：No, it's wonderful.

[charaFace B 0]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Really!? Oh, yes...[sr]They're absolutely delicious, aren't they!
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Oh...um...ahem.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
If my gift pleases you, then it was worth the effort![sr]After all, it is Valentine's Day.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Strange as it may be for me, I thought I might play the role of an innocent girl, just for today.

Hmm? What could possibly have you howling with laughter, lying on the sofa like that, my friend...?

You appear to have had some manner of revelation...and is that a manual for the latest gadget you're holding?

[charaFace C 0]

＠Andersen
Hmm...how odd. Now you mention it...why WAS I laughing so much? Was the prose horrendous or something?

[charaFace C 1]

＠Andersen
No...this might be a premonition.[sr]For example... Hm...
[k]

＠Andersen
...there's a fool who doesn't know their true self.[sr]They act so very self-important, dress in such lavish, overwrought styles...

And before they know it, they expose themselves, and even the children point and mock their nakedness!

Ah, “The Emperor's New Clothes”![sr]I enjoyed that story very much!

A truly wonderful story with a delightful combination of bitterness and kindness. How appropriate that you were the one to write it, my celibate friend!
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Andersen
You've said enough, William!
[k]

＠Andersen
I do not care what kind of criticism I get from my readers, but I do care about criticism from my fellow writers. It's practically murder, you know!
[k]

＠Andersen
Fine. Let's go outside. I actually have a few things to say about your manuscripts now that we're on the subject!
[k]

＠Andersen
How dare you make Puck such a foolish trickster! Children's tales always have fairies now, thanks to you!

A nice, hot cup of tea pairs perfectly with those treats.[sr]In fact, if you do not mind, I will pour for you.
