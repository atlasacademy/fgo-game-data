A room that slows the flow of time!?[sr]What marvelous news!
[k]

＠Shakespeare
If we do our writing in there, we will have all the time in the world to finish our work, no matter how long a composition we create!

Unlike you, I have no intention of writing an overlong story. Nobody would want to read a children's story that long in any case.

I must admit, though, that should such a room truly exist, it would be tremendously beneficial to our creative endeavors. It is worth checking out.

I mean, it would be awful if we passed on a chance to find the perfect retreat away from deadlines.

It's not that I'm not focused on the painting I'm working on, but...I don't know...it's hard to explain.

We have learned to content ourselves with what we are given, even as we hope for more... That, I am afraid, is the nature of time.

＠Shakespeare
At any rate, this special room should be of great benefit to us, whatever our work may be. Ah, it would seem to be just over there.

Onward, to this new creative paradise!

Hmmm, personally, it gave me[sr]some riveting thematic ideas...

Time does indeed slow down[sr]for those inside that room.

It affects organic, inorganic, and even spiritual things like us... But only when there's chocolate involved.

That is to say, we will only reap said benefit if we ourselves are involved in the chocolate-making process while inside!

I suppose things would be different if we left a conche or similar device inside, but still...

Hmph. Still, I'll milk the room for all it's worth if I'm ever forced to write something that just so happens to be chocolate-themed.
[k]

＠Andersen
Perhaps some ridiculous sob story about a family sharing a single piece of chocolate, only to die of starvation... Though if it ever comes to that, I may lay down my pen and quit being a writer!

Hm. Well, with some Heroic Spirits using literally mounds of the stuff to make their gifts, I assumed supply and demand were at least somewhat in balance...

...but it seems like things have begun to fall apart, huh.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I'm afraid we don't have any choice but to take them all though. We don't know what sort of effect they might have on the world if left alone.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The simplest solution would be to have Semiramis stop producing chocolate altogether...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Da Vinci
So, did you manage to ask her about that?
[k]

？1：Well...
？！

＠Da Vinci
She won't give us a break, huh?[sr]I guess I'm not surprised.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Da Vinci
It looks like it's time to start asking some of the questions we've avoided up till now.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Just how much chocolate does Semiramis want to produce? And...why? To what end?
[k]

＠Mash
And how does she have that floating garden[sr]when she seems to be a Rogue Servant?
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
These are questions that we should have asked earlier. We will need to reflect on our mistakes.
[k]

＠Mash
But in Chaldea's defense, the chocolate we were being supplied with was going to help our annual Valentine's Day celebration go smoothly.
[k]

＠Mash
That is probably why we turned[sr]a blind eye to all of this.
[k]

？1：And the chocolates I filched were delicious...
？2：I was happy to see the empress smile for once...
？！

[charaFace G 0]
＠Da Vinci
It's our fault that we weren't on top of things earlier,[sr]but there's nothing we can do about that now.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Let's focus on the matter at hand. No doubt that floating garden possesses incredible power.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I've been looking into it, but it looks like I'm going to have to work a lot harder on my analysis. For now, I'd like you to buy me some time to keep searching.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Not to worry. I don't see further exponential increases in chocolate production at this point.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
For the time being, continue helping out the empress.[sr]We still don't have any proof that her motives are evil.
[k]

？1：No further increases...? Not sure about that...
？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
You're right. I have this sinking feeling that something disastrous is about to happen...
