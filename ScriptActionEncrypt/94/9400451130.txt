Ugh... Won't these guys ever give up!?[sr]They were like this back at Rashomon, and now here...
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Not only that, they've adapted to my movements! They're not powerful, but their tactics have gotten way too complex!

Just you watch! This time I'll drink down double, nay, triple the wine!
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
In the stories you humans made up, wasn't the leader of the Onigashima oni called Ura?
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
He was a great oni that measured more than four meters tall! Just watch as I grow to that same stature[line 3]

Raikou... Wait, you mean Minamoto-no-Raikou!? The one whom Kintoki served under as one of the Four Heavenly Kings!?

Then... She's actually a really beautiful woman with an amazing body! Isn't that deviating from history way too much!?

That's naughty, Kintoki. Didn't I tell you before?[sr]You should always watch your manners around others.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
And... “What the hell are you doing here.” How rude is that? It's almost like you're treating me as a nuisance.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...If...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
If that's really how you think about your mother...[sr]I am going to cry, you know?

？1：...Mother?
？2：I don't think it's nice to make your mother cry!
？！

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Another troubling statement!
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I can hardly believe the most powerful Mystic Slayer of the Heian era, the most renowned demon-killer in all of Japan, is a woman...
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
...On top of that, what did she just say?[sr]Kintoki, what's her relationship with you!?

But it's true that I'm indebted to her for taking me in and raising me[line 2]

[charaFace E 7]

＠Sakata Kintoki
This is what Boss Raikou was like from the beginning. She said, “I will support you as a mother rather than an older sister.”

＠Sakata Kintoki

Aren't you the same as ever, Raikou. Children don't like it when their mothers can't let them go, you know?

But that's about as far as your suffering will last.[sr]It's about time for you to go...
