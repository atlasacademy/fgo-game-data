We built everything according to your blueprints, Marie... They were certainly quite extensive.

＠Mash
A seesaw, a jungle gym, monkey bars, and a swing. There's even an elephant-shaped slide, and many other things...

This tile mosaic... Is it an artistic interpretation of you, Marie?

A dream park designed by me, produced by me, to be enjoyed to the fullest by me! That's what Marie Land is all about!

＠Marie
Now then, Master, Mash, and everyone else![sr]This is Marie Land's grand opening! Let's go have fun!

Yes, this is a fun, new experience. How can a contraption with simple back and forth movements be so fun? How mystifying.

Yes, of course![sr]Look, look! How high do you think I can swing?

But according to some sources, many of these types of parks have been torn down in recent years.

But they're so much fun. Why?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Probably for the safety of the children. I understand that it's better to prevent accidents before they happen.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Marie
But there are no children here, and we're on a desert island. We've got nothing to worry about.

[charaFace A 8]

Although some people are playing in ways children shouldn't see...

And there's Martha, performing low kicks over and over on the half-buried tire intended for leapfrog...

This would set a bad example for the children...

As a Heroic Spirit from India, he's probably ridden an elephant before. Maybe he feels nostalgic...

As for whether it suits him... No comment.

Yes, yes, that's precisely right, Master! That's why I had lots of different pieces of playground equipment made!

Come on, let's try something else now![sr]We're going to play until the sun sets!
