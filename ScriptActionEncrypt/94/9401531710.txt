＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
We are nearly there, Kyogoku! Do you understand, my beloved steed? You must run faster than ever before!
[k]

＠Kyogoku
Neiiighhh! (Translation: I'm giving it all the magical energy I have, but I won't let you down!)
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Ahh, what a courageous response.[sr]Indeed, you have always been a trustworthy companion.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Even when you were facing down an army of Ushi-Oni, you never once faltered. You continued to bear me anywhere and everywhere, no matter how many wounds you suffered.

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
That takes me back to the time when I ventured to Sanjou all on my own...
[k]

＠Kyogoku
Snort, snort![sr](Translation: I'll never forget what happened that day!)
[k]

＠Kyogoku
Snort...snort! Snooort![sr](Translation: Nor will I ever forget the events of this day either!)
[k]

＠Bailong
Neigh...[sr](Translation: Kyogoku, is it just me...)
[k]

＠Bailong
Neigh, neigh...?[sr](Translation: ...or have you been a little TOO excited since Raikou changed into a swimsuit?)
[k]

＠Kyogoku
Neiiigh![sr](Translation: I d-d-don't know what you're t-t-talking about!)

＠Sanzang
It looks like they are getting along well too![sr]They must have become friends during the race!
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Perhaps they have, great monk. Hehe, to tell the truth, I feel as though I have uncovered a whole new layer of myself in the course of this journey.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Sanzang
Yup, you sure have! Or, at least, you've taken off what few layers you had on to begin with!
[k]

＠Sanzang
(I don't think she realizes she's the most indecently dressed one here. No, I'm sure she doesn't. Just what does she think public decency is!?)
[k]

＠Sanzang
(For that matter, is it just me,[sr]or has she completely forgotten about it!?)
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
To be a Heroic Spirit is to be a shadow.[sr]As we are not living people, we can never hope to grow...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
And yet, over the course of this journey, I feel as though I have managed to grow, and become more well-rounded!
[k]

＠Kyogoku
Snooort![sr](Translation: Oh yes! They've grown! Very round!)
[k]

＠Bailong
Snort...[sr](Translation: Stop trying to look behind you while you run!)
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
It is a shame that this journey must come to an end, but my bosom swells with excitement at what may come next!
[k]

[se ad83]
＠Kyogoku
Snort! Neiiigh!?[sr](Translation: Bosom? Swelling!?)
[k]

＠Bailong
Neighhh![sr](Translation: Kyogoku! ENOUGH!)
