Heh heh heh. If our battlefield is the Land of the Rising Sun, then it is only natural for me to lead the charge.

I am unaccustomed to killing monsters, but there is no finer warrior across the Land of the Rising Sun than I!

I will leap even when there are no ships! Your humble Servant, Ushiwakamaru, has hastened here knowing my Master's in danger!

＠Ushiwakamaru
Well, the truth is Fou led me me here, but that's another story. I really wanted that sweet red bean jelly.

(Ohh, so that's why there was some jelly in the Coffin...)

Wait, a reading I've never seen before is approaching your location! What's this... I can't even tell its shape!
