＠Georgios
I could not bring him along in the summons this time around, but I have a beloved horse named Bayard.
[k]

＠Georgios
This horse received a special blessing that granted him a characteristic where he can deflect any single attack.

＠Georgios
I took a bit of his mane and made it into an accessory.

[k]

＠Georgios
But even they may meet an untimely end. Should that happen, my hope is that this will protect you.

＠Georgios
We blessed it with our prayers.

？1：We?
？！

＠Georgios

[charaFace A 1]

＠Georgios
Hahahaha. I'm terribly sorry! That was a joke. Please take it.
[k]

？1：Thank you!
？！

＠Georgios
And thank you. I am very happy to receive such a fine gift.
