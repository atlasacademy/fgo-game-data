You have no right to call me that. You should refer to me as “uncle” when I'm summoned as king.

＠Vlad III
I told you before. Each different aspect of a particular hero manifests as its own distinct Servant.

You have indeed. You committed a sin... though the world may not consider it that way.

That sin is not even engraved upon your Spirit Origin. After all, that world has been forgotten.

You denied the final integrity of my light, my wife, my love.

That Vlad III and Elisabeth had a bit of a history together.

This isn't about who's right and who's wrong.

＠Robin Hood
The World isn't concerned by human values like virtue. It will just adopt whatever means are useful to guarantee the continuation of its existence.

＠Robin Hood
Whether it's a young lady who tries to atone for her grave sins, even if she knows no shame...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Robin Hood
...or the conviction of a gentleman who won't accept any kind of atonement, but just seeks to punish every evil act... The World considers them equally sinful.

...Right. They're the same, so it will choose the one that's more effective[line 2]even someone evil, if it means preserving humanity.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If humanity's preservation isn't wished for, they won't be allowed to be summoned as a Heroic Spirit. Even if they stand for righteousness.
[k]

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Dr. Roman
But if that's the case, it means even Vlad III wishes for the preservation of humanity.

＠Ibaraki-Douji
That being said, I have no intention of destroying their world. After all, humans are useful for a number of things.
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
I exist because humans, my enemies, exist. In a world without humans, neither Shuten nor I would be summoned.

Isn't that true, Red Horns?[sr]No matter how many sins you've committed...
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Ibaraki-Douji
No one can reject your being here right now. As long as you don't wish for “nothingness,” you'll be a Heroic Spirit like the rest of us.

Of course, as an Anti-Hero... A sacrifice whose role is to lose to the Heroic Spirits.

No, no, calm down. Calm down.[sr]Everyone makes mistakes. I'm no exception.

Rather, a beautiful queen is the only one allowed to make careless mistakes. Paradoxically, those mistakes are what make her a queen in the first place!

Yes, that's right. That proves I'm not at fault here. Therefore...
