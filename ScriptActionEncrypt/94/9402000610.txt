＠Benkei
Please, my most famous and renowned of lords![sr]I beg of you!
[k]

＠Benkei
Would you be so kind as to leave this place[sr]and run happily around a nearby field!?
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Wh-where is this coming from?[sr]You're acting even stranger than usual, Ben[line 2]
[k]

＠Benkei
Noooooo! Do you not remember!? Just for today,[sr]I asked you to call me by another name!
[k]

＠Benkei
I will refer to you as my most famous and renowned of lords, so please, use a different address for me as well!
[k]

[charaFace E 3]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I don't even know what that means...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Benkei
It is to distinguish you from Master,[sr]my most famous and renowned of lords!

＠Ushiwakamaru
...Well, no matter. Then for this day only,[sr]you shall be Captain Cosplay.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Benkei
Ouch! You wound me to my core! W-well, that is all right. I shall consider it a battle lost and a war wo[line 2]Huh?

It is just a rat! Nothing you need to concern yourself with, my most famous and renowned of lords!

＠Benkei
Now, we have not a moment to waste. As a matter of fact, Master said [&he:she] had a request to make of you, my most famous and renowned of lords!

Oh? What is it?

[charaFace C 0]

＠Benkei
Well, uh... It was something about wanting to see what a warrior from Japan was capable of, I believe? Now that [&he's:she's] back in the country and all.
[k]

＠Benkei
More specifically... It was about hunting the beasts that reside in that far-off field.
[k]

＠Benkei
[&He:She] has been greatly interested in the giant Yamata-no-Orochi that has been consuming copious amounts of wine as of late. No doubt [&he:she] would be very pleased if you offered up some of its heads as trophies.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I see... Wonderful! So, Master has finally[sr]seen the joy and value of head-hunting!
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Very well then, how many heads did [&he:she] say [&he:she] wanted?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Benkei
Oh, right. Well, you know. The more the better.[sr]I am sure that is what [&he:she] would want. Yes.
[k]

＠Benkei
Should your hunt continue until you just happen to realize this tower has disappeared, I think that will suffice.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Then...I can hunt heads to my heart's content?[sr]It is like a dream come true...
[k]

[charaFace E 2]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Very well, I, [charaFace C 2][image berserker_language_1][wt 0.5]maru,[charaFace C 0] shall devote[sr]myself to this task with utmost dedication!
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I shall travel far and wide to surpass my personal best of heads presented to my brother, [charaFace C 2][image berserker_language_1][wt 0.5][charaFace C 0]...
[k]


[charaFace E 5]

＠Ushiwakamaru
...What is the meaning of this, Captain Cosplay?[sr]Why do you keep interrupting me with Berserker yells?
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Benkei
[image berserker_language_1][wt 0.5][line 2][charaFace C 0]Ahem, ahem ahem. Apologies, my most famous and renowned lord. My throat has been bothering me today.
[k]

＠Benkei
I must have performed one too many Buddhist chants.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

＠Ushiwakamaru
So that is what you sound like when your throat is in poor shape? Oh well, I suppose a bit of thunderous intensity IS to be expected when performing Buddhist chants.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Ushiwakamaru
At any rate, I must be off[sr]if I am to surpass my record.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Benkei
Understood. If I may, my most famous and renowned of lords, I would advise you to go straight ahead, without looking back, and gracefully leap down from this tower!
[k]

＠Benkei
Master also said [&he:she] would love to see the beauty of your perfect dive in a forty-story drop!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Heh. Well of course, this height is but a trifle to me.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Very well then. Wherever you may be, my lord,[sr]behold this display of skill and agility!

Hey, you there! I'm the loyal oni that[sr]guards this floor for various reasons!

[charaFace F 2]

＠Loyal Oni
[image berserker_language_1]...![sr]Did you not listen to that conversation, Master!?
[k]

＠Loyal Oni
Please! Refrain...from using...that name!
[k]

？2：That was one hell of a distraction there.

＠Loyal Oni
I am sorry to have kept you waiting so long.[sr]But I'm afraid that my task there was a crucial one.
[k]

＠Loyal Oni
Indeed, it was arguably the most[sr]important thing I have ever done.

I'm afraid I just can't tell[sr]who you are under that mask.

＠Loyal Oni
So, whatever it is you think you saw, I am afraid I must tell you that you did not see it, Lady.

＠Loyal Oni
As for the shameless exhibitionist who was just here,[sr]I would write her off as just your run-of-the-mill nymphomaniac, or a hallucination. Or something.

My purpose here was to prevent my most famous and renowned of lords from seeing someone she shouldn't. Unfortunately, I was then told by a certain high-powered lawyer that this was breaking and entering.
[k]

＠Loyal Oni
And since I have no means of paying the fine,[sr]I was forced to guard this floor as punishment.
[k]

＠Loyal Oni
In other words, no, I have not become a hapless oni pawn. I am simply trying to set matters right.

If you will not step aside peacefully, we will pass through by force...large familiar stranger!
