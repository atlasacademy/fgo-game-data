＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Uggghhh... Once I heard there was no one here, I think this island started to feel even hotter.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I think foxes shine brightest when there's snow and cold, don't you, Master?
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
My poor tail is soaked with sweat.[sr]You know what I'm talking about, right, Fou?

The food we took with us when we left is almost gone.

Even if we just use it to keep Master alive, who knows how much is left...

The way you shiver when you realize there's a long time till you hit port, and you're almost out of food...

It reminded me of that.

Don't worry.[sr]There's no need to think too much about it.

Scáthach... Do you have a plan?
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Scáthach
I don't know if you could call it a plan, but we have to do what we must.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Scáthach
Our first priority needs to be to try and contact Chaldea.[sr]And then we can request help.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes... That's right. But the problem is that we can't get through. I don't think the system is broken...

＠Mash
We lost the connection once we arrived on this island, so if we leave, it might be restored.
[k]

？1：But if we can't leave the island...
？2：We mustn't forget Blackbeard's noble sacrifice...

I think a good way to start may be trying to find a way off this place.
[k]

＠Mary
Yeah. Blackbeard told us that an ordinary ship wouldn't be enough.
[k]

＠Mary
...Which means that a good, proper ship just might.

But...this island is uninhabited, right?[sr]Surely we wouldn't be able to procure such a ship?

We can make one.

？1：...Come again?

＠Scáthach
I said we can make one, Master.
[k]

？2：Is a ship something you can...make?

Don't worry. I know a thing or two about it.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Scáthach
By combining my runes, I can make almost anything.
[k]

＠Scáthach
I need time, and materials, though.
[k]

？1：S-So dependable!
？！

[charaFace F 0]
＠Scáthach
As far as I can tell, this island should have what we need.[sr]It seems very bountiful.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Thus, we probably don't need to worry about resources.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Scáthach
...It's the monsters that surprise me. I didn't expect to see this many stomping around like they own the place.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Scáthach
An island's supposed to have a ruler, see.[sr]Be it human, beast, or god.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Scáthach
So either the ruler has abandoned his duties, or he has forgotten them... It's a sad thing, either way.

That's what you get for wearing such heavy protection.[sr]It's foolish to try and dress up to intimidate an opponent.

＠Altria
You should take this opportunity to pick armor that suits your frame. Of course, even if you do[line 3]
[k]

＠Altria
That still won't be enough to bring your grade as a knight above negative.
