No. I couldn't leave Mr. Leonidas behind...[sr]No, that's not what I wanted to ask.

Does Fake-stolfo have any basis for calling himself a magical girl? Besides his usual “I just feel like it” thing.

To be specific, it makes me wonder if my attacks will be effective in this Reality Marble!

Now that you mention it, I can feel strong MG Power from Fake-stolfo.
