Does it have to do with what you're looking for?

Oh, no. What I'm seeking is more of a bonus.[sr]Or, well, it's sort of all in my mind.

There is a legitimate reason for my manifestation.[sr]It's very difficult to put into words though...

＠Pārvatī
But let's see...it feels like there is something that I must do...

＠Da Vinci
Hm. If you manifested as a Servant, that means you will need a Master to help you accomplish whatever it is you want to do.

What do you think?

I can very confidently put forward [%1] as highly recommended Master.
