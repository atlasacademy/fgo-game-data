You call, Master, and Sasaki Kojirou comes. Do you have any business with me, [%1]?

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Heh. It's no good to play possum. I knew the moment I saw you darting about like a rabbit.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
This is the holiday where those who are close exchange gifts. This is known as Valentine's Day.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Haha. I may not look it, but I have been a Servant for a long time. I am quite aware of many customs of this time.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
And thus, I am an ideal Servant to consult for advice on such things. So, to which Servant do you wish to give chocolates?
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Could it be that individual?[sr]The graceful and shining, handsome Fi[line 3]
[k]

？1：No, it's Sasaki.
？2：No, it's Kojirou.

？！

＠Sasaki Kojirou
...What now?
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
...Where are my manners? My attempt to be helpful has caused you unnecessary embarrassment.

I may have spoken of the trends, but it looks like I still require training. Then I shall simply thank you for your kindness.

Many thanks, Master. I have the urge to show this off to the other Servants as a sign of my victory, but I shall hold back.

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Do you have any time after this, [%1]?
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
I do not have many material goods, so there is nothing that I can give in return.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
But that will leave a bitter taste in my mouth, which would affect my swordsmanship.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
There is only one thing I can think to repay you. I would like you to join this impoverished swordsman in his greatest attempt to show off.
