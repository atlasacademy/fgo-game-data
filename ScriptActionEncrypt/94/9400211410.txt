Long story short, basically because of my curse, even this beautiful one bedroom apartment...
[k]

＠Nobunaga
...that's close to the station, has cheap rent, looks like a fashionable place for a noble to live in...
[k]

＠Nobunaga
...would turn into a different dimension like that Flame-something City.

Nobunaga's curse... I guess her unfulfilled dream and early death at Honnoji has turned into a form of grudge and...
[k]

？1：It can't be helped...
？2：The whole thing was burned to the ground...

“Oh my, cute Okita here has gathered a whole lot of Friend Points today.”

“Speaking of Friend Points, how many do you have Nob... Oh...”

[charaFace F 2]
＠Nobbu
She will pick a fight with me like that! Besides, during GUDAGUDA Honnoji,
[k]

＠Nobbu
all of you people were praising me left and right like “Nobbu so cute! Nobbu is the best! Nobbuuuuuu!”
[k]

＠Nobbu
Now what? The event is finished so you're done with me? You only need Okita now?
