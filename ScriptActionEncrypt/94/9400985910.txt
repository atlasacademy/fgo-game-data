Hey, hey. Hektor here, in the flesh.[sr]Master, what the heck is that?
[k]

＠Hektor
Is this old man a good enough Servant to deserve such a grand reward?
[k]

＠Hektor
I may be good at defending, but not so much attacking.
[k]

？1：Now, now.
？2：Just take it.
？！

Ah-ha! Oh, thank you so much![sr]I'm so moved, I just might drop this lance!

＠Hektor
But to receive such grand chocolates, yet have nothing to give in return. The good name of Hektor will be tarnished.
[k]

＠Hektor
Something that Master would enjoy... What do I have?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Hektor
Well, I have one thing.[sr]Wait just a moment!

？1：This is...?

＠Hektor
This has got to be what you think of when you think of Troy. It's a Trojan Horse.
[k]

？2：A Trojan Horse?

＠Hektor
Correct! This old man's crafting skills are still good.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Hektor
Huh? Do I feel remorse, you ask? Not really.
[k]

＠Hektor
The idea of Troy that I hold in my heart ended when I died.
[k]

＠Hektor
It was unfortunate that Troy fell after I died. But it is the destiny of all nations to change and fall.
[k]

＠Hektor
I loved my country with my entire being until my death. But it is no business of mine what happens to my country after that.
[k]

＠Hektor
A country's living citizens are the ones who should be responsible for its battles and protection.
[k]

＠Hektor
Its fate saddens me, yes.[sr]But to dwell on it forever is practically evil.
[k]

＠Hektor
And to be honest...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Hektor
How the heck do you fall for a stupid trick like that!? Paris, you bastard! You should've protected Troy with your life!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Hektor
Ahem. That is, at least, part of how I feel.[sr]I mean, look at this thing.
[k]

＠Hektor
Who in their right mind would allow something like this through the gates?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Hektor
Anyway. Master, I may or may not have told you this...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Hektor
Right now, you are Troy to this old man.
[k]

＠Hektor
So if you accept this from me, all other wooden horses will look like crap to you.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Hektor
Kidding!
