＠Assassin?
I am commanded from beyond the bounds of human understanding. I cannot coexist with those trapped by ethics.

Assassin has retreated.[sr]...Shall we follow?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
No. Let's avoid any other battles. Overexerting ourselves just makes us a target for other enemies.

I'd like to suggest to Einzbern that she put away her weapon for the day.

You have more threats to worry about than just us.

You may not believe me, but we don't intend to make enemies of the Einzbern clan.

＠El-Melloi
We couldn't help what happened on the wharf.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
In fact, I'd imagine Saber there found it strange that we didn't pursue her.

...That's right, Irisviel. There's something strange about the way they fight.
[k]

＠Altria
I don't know why, but there's a meekness, as if they're trying to keep themselves from winning.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

I'll make this simple. Are you our enemies, or our friends?

Our goal does not involve the battle for the Grail, and to achieve that, we need your Saber to be kept safe.

That's all I can say for now while still telling you the truth.

We have lots of other enemies that we need to prioritize first.

＠El-Melloi
Let me ask you something.[sr]Do you know who that Assassin was?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Irisviel
Not really. He was saying something strange. That neither of you were participants in the Holy Grail War...
[k]

＠El-Melloi
That Assassin's presence is clearly an irregularity.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Not that we're one to talk, in that respect. Our immediate goal is to solve the mystery of his identity.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]
＠Irisviel
The mystery, huh? He did seem strange, yes.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
What do you mean?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Irisviel
I've never met him, but for some reason...he seems like someone I'm deeply related to.
[k]

＠Irisviel
Like he was here only to kill me, and I was only here to be killed by him...

It felt like we existed only to destroy and be destroyed.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
The intuition of a homunculus, the crowning achievement of the Einzberns' most secret techniques, cannot be easily dismissed.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

...Fated to kill each other... No.[sr]No, Irisviel. That's not true.

I will protect you with my blade.[sr]You are here on this battlefield to be victorious.

Yes, you're right. With a Servant like you at my side,[sr]I have nothing to fear at all.
