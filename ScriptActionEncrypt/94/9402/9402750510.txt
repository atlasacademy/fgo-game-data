＠Elisabeth
Hm? You wanna know how to make doujin? You really signed up for ServantFes without even knowing that?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Elisabeth
Heh, that's either really brave, or really reckless. Reminds me of how bad last year's Halloween got.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
But that's okay with me.[sr]I like a little recklessness.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
All right, as a fellow Anti-Hero...of sorts,[sr]I'll offer you a word of advice.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

＠Elisabeth
I don't know what sort of story you're looking to draw, but you can't just go right to a printer with a draft.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
First, you need to actually make[sr]an appointment to see the printer.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Elisabeth
Your schedule's already pretty packed, right? Trust me, I know. Mine's wound tighter than a boa constrictor.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
There's pretty much no chance of you sending your draft to the printer before the very last second, so if I were you, I'd go meet them while I still could.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Elisabeth
You'll find them right arooound...here,[sr]between Waikiki Street and the airport.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
I recommend taking the bus over a taxi.[sr]Seriously, Waikiki's public transport is awesome.

Aloha, youngsters. I say, is it just me, or is there something strange about Hawaii lately?

＠Aloha Guy
You see, my homuncu[line 2]er,[sr]attendants were just telling me:
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Aloha Guy
“Aw man, we've gotta shut down soon, huh. If only we could take a paid vacation to Hawaii, just once...”
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Aloha Guy
They were rather enthusiastic about it, in fact.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Aloha Guy
At any rate, I came here to take a look at the Hawaiian branch of the organization I aim to acquire one day...
[k]

[charaFace F 9]

＠Aloha Guy
...but there's clearly something else strange going on here right now. For example, who are all those strange people mixed in among the regular tourists?

Well, that just won't do.[sr]My danger sense is going absolutely berserk!

＠Aloha Guy
Hey, you lot! We're going back to my northern summer home! We'll scope out Diamond Head Beach some other time!

Hmph. A perfectly good Hawaiian outfit[sr]to blend in with the locals, wasted...

＠Jeanne Alter
No point running ourselves ragged when we don't even know where to look, so I say we call it a day.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I still want to check the printer out, but without a book to print, there's not much point. Long as we get the final draft done, the rest'll work itself out.
[k]

？1：Then let's go back to the hotel and brainstorm.

[charaFace B 6]

＠Jeanne Alter
Right on. We'll brainstorm until we figure out what kinda story we wanna write. If that works out, we can go right to the drawing and writing phase!
[k]

？2：We could also just make our own photocopies.

[charaFace B 16]

＠Jeanne Alter
Ulp... I was really hoping to avoid that, but I guess, if we've got no other choice... Then again...can we really get by with just photocopies?

All right then, let's go back, have some dinner, and discuss story ideas. You guys go on ahead; I'll grab some grub for all of us and meet you there later.

Hope you're ready for all the Luluhawan fruit-filled junk food you can eat.
