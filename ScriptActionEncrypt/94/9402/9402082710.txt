What? Is that not enough?[sr]What else do you want from me!?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
I really wanted to skip this,[sr]but since I'm your Servant I really can't.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
So I'm just handling this stupid event in my own way!
[k]

？1：But...
？2：I was...looking forward to it...

＠Meltryllis
Really?[sr]Look at you, so mopey and pathetic.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
...Hmph. I can't believe it.[sr]So I didn't really even need to come find you, huh?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
Fine. Since you look so pathetic, I'll stick around a bit, it being Valentine's Day and all.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
So what was your fantasy for this?[sr]Sweet nothings whispered in your ear? A hug?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Go ahead. Tell me everything you hoped for.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠Meltryllis
That way I can do precisely the opposite of what you were anticipating.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
I am Meltryllis, the Alter Ego of pleasure. My methods of charming lovers and reducing them to nothing are the best in all the universe.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Meltryllis
Everyone who sees me ends up utterly captivated.[sr]They all drown in pleasure.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
So you want to melt for me, do you,[sr][%1]?
[k]

？1：(Okay, this is not going at all well...)
？2：P-please explain what your chocolates are!

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Meltryllis
Huh? You just want me to explain my chocolates?[sr]Fine, whatever...
[k]

＠Meltryllis
First of all, I hate the concept of Valentine's Day, partly because chocolates are not beautiful.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Both dark and white chocolates are solid.[sr]They're bland. No different than molding clay.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Meltryllis
That's right! They're no different than clay! And even then, molding things into figures is WAY better!
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Heart-shaped chocolate, chocolate bars, using chocolate to make extravagant cakes, or making them into cube-shaped ice cream to try to be different...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Meltryllis
What loathsome simplemindedness! Does everyone have spun sugar for brains or something!?
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Meltryllis
There's absolutely no creativity! Come on![sr]They're supposed to be for your beloved!
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Shouldn't your chocolates be an inimitable expression of who you are, condensed to its purest form!?
[k]

[wt 1.5]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Meltryllis
Hmph! You're making one of your[sr]“calm down, relax” faces.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
I am calm! I am relaxed!
[k]

＠Meltryllis
And my chocolate is proof. A lovely, transparent crystal that dazzles, and is wonderfully textured.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Its exterior is an iced wafer made from freezing hundred-year-old natural water. I'm glad Chaldea's in[line 2]I mean, I'm glad I found what I needed here.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Meltryllis
Within the crystal is manuka honey, harvested by busy bees from the flowers that grow at the edge of a valley two thousand meters deep.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Meltryllis
What do you think? Honey so rare that it can only reach the taste buds of a select few lucky people...with some special modifications made by yours truly.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Meltryllis
...Though, I did mix a bit of my Melt Virus into it. It's about thirty percent natural honey, seventy percent my virus.
[k]

？1：...Oh...
？2：Does that mean I'm going to die?

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Meltryllis
Probably. Your Magic Resistance is pretty pathetic, really. If you eat it, you're a goner...definitely.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
But isn't that exactly what the poison we call love does? How foolish of you, contracting with me if you don't even have the resolve to let yourself die.
[k]

？1：I wouldn't mind you melting me.

[charaFace A 6]

＠Meltryllis
Oh? How bold of you, [%1].[sr]Perhaps you're finally starting to understand.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
But can you really take it?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Know that my poison isn't just about pain and pleasure.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
The sensation of changing forms...into something other than yourself always comes with fear.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Hopefully you don't disgrace yourself by screaming and begging for help.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Or perhaps...

＠Meltryllis
Are you prepared for All Drain?[sr]To become mine, body and soul?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
To be reduced to no more than a droplet for me to swallow and absorb like experience points?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
And instead of honey of the highest grade, do you prefer to consume Melt Virus of the highest grade?

Just kidding. If I just killed you, Lip would never let me hear the end of it.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
But this has gotten me all riled up.[sr]I'm just going to step outside and cool my head.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Meltryllis
Oh, and by the way...eating that chocolate won't kill you. You might pass out because it's just TOO delicious for you, but that's it.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Meltryllis
I just wanted to play out a fantasy of a really intense Valentine's Day chocolate gift, like, done with murderous intent, and to have someone eat it, willing to die.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Meltryllis
Now that we've done that, you can do whatever you want. Well, later, Master.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Jokes aside, it won't all be fun and games from now on.
[k]


？2：I'm sorry...I'm giving this back.

[charaFace A 9]

[shake 0.12 1 4 0.5]

＠Meltryllis
What, why!? Eat it![sr]I worked really hard on it!!!
[k]

[wt 1.5]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Meltryllis
...Crap![sr]I can't believe I got so riled up.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Meltryllis
Listen.[sr]I will not be accepting returns.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
...Yeah I know, it's because of my poison, but I removed the Drain elements from it. Obviously.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Eating it will, at worst, make you pass out from how delicious it is. I can't really guarantee that it's not addictive, though.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Meltryllis
...Hmph.[sr]Anyway, just take it and be grateful.

[charaFace A 6]

＠Meltryllis
Oh, and a word of warning.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
You can accept a gift from Lip.[sr]But never, EVER accept one from BB.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Meltryllis
She's way more villainous than I am.[sr]Just be careful not to let her toy with you, okay?
[k]
