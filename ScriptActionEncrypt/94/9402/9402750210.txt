Hm? Why Luluhawa, you ask? Well, what would[sr]you call a mashup of Honolulu and Hawaii?

I did my best to give our little stage here a cute name, so a little recognition for that would be nice!

So, this is Hawaii, huh. And here I thought all it would be is just a really hot island.

[charaFace G 1]

There's nice, warm sunlight...clean air...wide, spacious skies...!

The wind is nice and cool, while the sunlight is warm without being overbearing. It feels silly to even think about fighting here...

The Daniel K. Inouye International Airport is on Oahu! We shouldn't even be able to see Mauna Kea from here!
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Oahu and Hawaii are over three hundred kilometers apart! It takes at least an hour to get there! By plane!

I'm detecting the Singularity now too! The whole of the Hawaiian Islands has become a Singularity!

She pretty much only acts on malice and a really twisted idea of good intentions.
