In Hawaiian mythology, Pele lives in Kilauea.[sr]That part fits.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
But BB never went there.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Even weirder, she explicitly told us to come here, to Mauna Kea, on the last day.
[k]

[charaFace B 13]

＠Jeanne Alter
That just doesn't make sense. Mauna Kea is the snowy mountain where Poliʻahu lived.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
According to myth, this was the one place Pele could never conquer, and she hated it more than anything.

Then, when I took a look through their telescope to see how far humanity's astronomical skills had advanced...

...it synergized with my own functionality, and I saw so far into space that I locked eyes with an evil god.

Turns out, Nietzsche was more right than he knew when he said that♡ As soon as our eyes met, I synchronized with the evil god and became an eeevil BB!

It didn't take long for Chaldea's Hawaiian office to catch on, so I went and tossed them all into my shadow♪
