＠BB Pele
Oh yes, absolutely. As I'm sure you all know,[sr]Pele's the goddess of Hawaii's volcanoes.
[k]

＠BB Pele
She's named for both the holy land, Pele-honua-mea,[sr]and the eater of the land, Pele-ai-honua.
[k]

＠BB Pele
I met her about a month ago when I was scoping out Hawaii as a possible ServantFes venue, and we hit it off right away.
[k]

＠BB Pele
But she was pretty weak 'cause of...reasons, so I copied her Divine Core and installed it in myself.

[charaFace E 1]
＠BB Pele
And that is the story of how I got this great tan!

＠BB Pele
The rest, as you all know, is history.

[charaFace E 6]

＠BB Pele
I used the authority over Hawaii I'd borrowed to make the Luluhawa Singularity...
[k]

＠BB Pele
...and went on to hold ServantFes, where tourists and Servants both can enjoy themselves freely!
[k]

[charaFace E 13]

Oh, something else about Pele[line 2]

Oho, so you know about the snow goddess Poliʻahu, huh? You really did your homework, didn't you!

[charaFace E 19]

＠E：BB Pele
Anyway, I'd love to properly reward you for all your help, but I've got a bunch of buildings I need to fix up. You know how it is.
[k]

＠E：BB Pele
Only two days left until ServantFes now.[sr]I can't wait to see the fruits of your labor☆

Any project'll get done eventually as long as you keep working at it. You've just gotta find a pace that works for you, Alty.
