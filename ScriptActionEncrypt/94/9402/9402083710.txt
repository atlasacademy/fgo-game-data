＠Bunyan
Master, welcome back.
[k]

＠Bunyan
Today's Valentine's Day, right?
[k]

＠Bunyan
I wanted to give you something, Master, for taking such good care of me. So, I made pancakes!
[k]

＠Bunyan
I had the man who's always in the kitchen help me,[sr]though I did most of the actual work myself.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Bunyan
They, um...they're too big to fit in any of the rooms,[sr]so I put them here for now... Wh-what do you think?
[k]

？1：They're really big.
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Bunyan
Hee hee...I used my specially made iron skillet.
[k]

＠Bunyan
I made them the good old-fashioned way, staying as faithful as possible to the pancake stories about me.
[k]

＠Bunyan
The kitchen man put bacon on the soles of his shoes and skated over the skillet to oil it.
[k]

＠Bunyan
He even showed off his graceful quintuple axel jump.
[k]

＠Bunyan
But after that, it was all me![sr]I mixed and cooked everything on my own!
[k]

？1：You did a great job!
？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Bunyan
Tehehe...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Bunyan
So come on, eat them before they get cold.
[k]

＠Bunyan
Oh, but hurry up![sr]The hallways are super crowded.
[k]

？1：I'll take a bite.
？！

(Drool...)
[k]

？1：...But I won't be able to finish all this by myself.
？2：Can you give me a hand?
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Bunyan
Eh? R-really?
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Bunyan
I guess I have no choice...[sr]I'll have to eat them with you!
[k]
