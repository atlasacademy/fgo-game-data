Ohhh? You seem very excited today, Master.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
Hehe...[sr]And I know why.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
It's Valentine's Day! The day where custom[sr]dictates you offer gifts to everyone you know!
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
Oh, what a wonderful idea![sr]...Ingenious, even!
[k]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
The gifts are usually food, so they can be consumed without taking up space! The lineup changes every year too, so things always feel new and exciting!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
And as for the economic effects! Just for instance, let's say in Japan, chocolate companies often see sales of over one hundred billion yen during[line 2]

[charaFace A 11]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
...What's that?[sr]Valentine's Day isn't just about money?
[k]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
I see, I see. You are absolutely right.[sr]How silly of me...
[k]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
It's the thought that counts when it comes to gifts...
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
Teehee. Let's see...[sr]If Master can correctly answer my riddle...

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
...I may give you a wonderful,[sr]special reward, just for today.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

[charaFace A 8]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
No idea. Use your imagination.

[charaFace A 9]

Yes. Exactly.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 10]

Tarasque flails his legs and tail, but he cannot get back on his feet!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
However, Master makes no effort to help him!
[k]

？1：I...I don't...?
？2：...
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
Now, tell me, Master:[sr]Why don't you try to save Tarasque?
[k]

？1：...
？2：B-because...
？！

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
...Because?
[k]

？1：I can't because he's too...heavy?

[charaFace A 7]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
That. Is. Incorrect!
[k]

？2：Because he's a strong, independent turtle-dragon[csr]who can take care of himself?

[charaFace A 13]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
Awww, how adorable![sr]That's a cute answer, but it's still incorrect!
[k]
？！

？1：Wait, let me try again!
？！

[charaFace A 9]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
All right, I suppose I can allow it.[sr]So, what's your answer?
[k]

？1：Because...I'm a...dragon slayer...?

[charaFace A 0]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
Interesting...[sr]That seems logical...
[k]

[charaFace A 15]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
Uh, I mean, never mind.[sr]Obviously incorrect!
[k]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
And surely there are other titles that suit you better, Master!
[k]

？2：Because Tarasque is reversible...?

[charaFace A 16]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
Pffft!
[k]

[charaFace A 15]

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
N-no, wasn't the least bit funny![sr]Y-you did not just hear me laughing!

＠A：[servantName 503400:Caster of Midrash:Queen of Sheba]
Also...it's incorrect!
