＠Semiramis
The factory that I had you build in order to truly get production going seems to be working well.
[k]

＠Semiramis
Of course, I would expect no less from my Special Minister, but I suppose I must follow the dictum of rewarding good work and punishing bad work.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Semiramis
So firstly, I shall reward you with praise.[sr]Good work, [%1].
[k]

？1：Thank you.
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Semiramis
Of course, the point of a factory is to consistently create something of amazing quality in large amounts.
[k]

＠Semiramis
In that respect, I must reward the one who decided upon and set the flavor of my Hanging Gardens brand chocolate.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Semiramis
I tried it myself, and was pleased[sr]to see that it is quite delicious.
[k]

＠Semiramis
So, accept your praise as well...who was it, now?[sr]My Roman three-star super taster...
[k]

Of course that's what I'd call myself. I certainly wouldn't call myself a pâtissier. Why? Because I can't for the life of me make pastries.
[k]

＠Caesar
I'm merely a man defined by my passions![sr]I eat! I savor! I require more!
[k]

＠Caesar
And obviously, I do not hesitate to state my own opinions when it comes to taste.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Caesar
I'll have you know...
[k]

＠Caesar
Should my divine palate come in handy,[sr]then my gourmet journey thus far was not in vain!

Your words humble me, O beautiful empress.

＠Caesar
You may not know this, but I myself was once a ruler too. The great nation of Rome was mine to command.
[k]

＠Caesar
I was more of a dictator, really, but it would not be inaccurate to say my position was akin to emperor.
[k]

＠Caesar
That is to say that we are of the same rank and station...or perhaps I am even higher, historically. The only one who might exceed me is the Holy Progenitor.
[k]

＠Caesar
So there's no need to feel reserved when speaking with me. Your heart should always be well-rounded, just like my rotund physique!
[k]

＠Caesar
What do you say? Perhaps we can have dinner together afterward, or better yet, shall we nibble on chocolates while we whisper sweet nothings to each other[line 2]
[k]

？1：Caesar...um...
？2：I'd quit while you're ahead...
？！

[charaFace B 5]

＠Caesar
What? Why are you getting in my way, Master?
[k]

＠Caesar
I worked hard.[sr]A hard worker should be compensated justly.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Caesar
I seek only what I am due, and in the natural course of conversation, I was succeeding in making an offer that could not possibly be resisted.
[k]

＠Caesar
As a descendant of the goddess of beauty, I should showcase how Rome's best lady-killer makes his[sr]move[line 2]

Lord Caesar!? Did I just hear you speak[sr]words that should never pass your lips?

Were those the words of a man who has a queen for a wife, and yet tries to put the moves on another woman?
