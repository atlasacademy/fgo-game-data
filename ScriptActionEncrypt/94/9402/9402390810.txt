Now, much as I would like to answer the questions so obviously nagging at you, it is hard to determine where to even begin.

[charaFace A 0]

＠Holmes
Ah, perhaps I should start[sr]with how I came to be here?
[k]

＠Holmes
Ever since this mystery began, I've been wondering how much of a time differential there was between your dream and reality.

＠Holmes
I further thought that, depending on what that differential turned out to be, I might be able to intervene directly.

Your walk on the beach with Juliet during[sr]a full moon provided a significant hint.

[charaFace A 6]

Indeed, it was elementary to connect the dots, even for someone as ignorant of astronomy as myself.

＠Holmes
At Chaldea, you collapsed while[sr]looking at the moon on May 14, 2019.
[k]

＠Holmes
You woke up for the fifth time on May 15, Chaldea time, and still the moon was not yet full.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Holmes
This led me to realize that your dream was actually taking place a few days in the future.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Holmes
Once I knew that, I decided to intervene directly,[sr]and now, here we are.
[k]

？1：Wait. This is all happening in the future...?

？！

＠Holmes
I'm afraid we don't yet know how it works, but yes, that is the inescapable conclusion. Regardless, what is important is not HOW it is happening, but WHEN.
[k]

＠Holmes
If you don't believe me, go ahead and look up a lunar calendar for yourself. You'll see that the full moon in May 2019 falls on the eighteenth here.
[k]


＠Holmes
Count backwards from that, and we can determine that Cain accidentally hit you with his ball in the afternoon of May 16, Kogetsukan time, marking the point where your dream began.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Holmes
Since it was May 15 at Chaldea when I arrived at this conclusion, I had a day to plan.

＠Holmes
Granted, I will concede that making[sr]my way here WAS fairly complicated.
[k]

＠Holmes
I first contacted the Goldie family as Sheringham, using my knowledge of the threatening letter to capture Aaron's attention.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Holmes
Though of course, he was rightfully suspicious of me, so he said he would only hire me if I managed to track down where they were staying on my own.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Holmes
From there, it was simply a matter of filling[sr]in the blanks, rather like a crossword puzzle.
[k]

＠Holmes
Given the travel time from the United States, and the fact that it was warm enough to go swimming even in the middle of May, I was almost immediately able to determine that you were somewhere in the Caribbean.
[k]

＠Holmes
Finding the Kogetsukan seemed trickier, but then I remembered that “kogetsu” is an old Japanese word for “crescent moon.”
[k]

＠Holmes
Using a map, I was able to pinpoint an island that was shaped like a crescent moon. The rest, you know.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Holmes
It was all quite easy, really. The only difficult part was convincing Da Vinci to let me come here, since doing so required me to Rayshift.

In the Violet family, the eldest son is supposed to take over when he comes of age, but I really didn't want to get involved in that world.

I thought they did it to save Juliet.[sr]And I actually appreciate that much, at least.

[charaFace B 5]

＠Cain
I couldn't stand that Morris guy either.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Cain
But killing Chris just seemed wrong. The only reason I could think of for them to do that is to keep Juliet for themself, not to help her.
[k]

＠Cain
Besides, if they were willing to kill those guys, then they might also be willing to kill other people in my family.

[k]

＠Holmes
On the contrary. This is a perfect closed circle of suspects. The killer has indeed been among us, from the very beginning.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Holmes
Now, Cain, I have a question for you.[sr]How do I know you are innocent?
[k]

＠Cain
I don't know when Morris died,[sr]so I can't say anything about that...
[k]

＠Cain
...but I might have an alibi for when Chris died.
[k]

＠Holmes
Does that mean you can prove where you were at 11:25 last night?

I was playing hide-and-seek with Laurie in an empty room. I think we got found about five minutes before that.
