＠Holmes
Perhaps when meeting someone for the first time, yes, but you are unlikely to be able to hide your dominant hand from someone you've spent a deal of time with.
[k]

＠Holmes
With the notable exception of Sheringham, each of our characters here belongs to his or her respective communities. Factions, if you like.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Holmes
You attended a meal where everyone was present, right? If there was a southpaw present who suddenly began using their right hand, someone would have said something.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Holmes
Given that that did not happen,[sr]we can conclude that no one there is left-handed.

＠Holmes
It wouldn't make any difference, Professor. An ambidextrous person, by definition, would have no issue using their right hand.
[k]

＠Holmes
But according to Chris, Sheringham specifically requested a left-handed teacup for his guest.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Holmes
Would this have been necessary if they could simply use their right hand? If you have an answer to that question, I'm happy to hear it.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Professor M
Hmph. So my playing the devil's advocate only[sr]strengthened your case. [wt 1.0][charaFace B 1]Well, no matter. I actually do happen to agree with you. Do go on.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Holmes
Well, if one were to nitpick at my hypothesis...

...I cannot deny the possibility that Sheringham could have been meeting with [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1]...

＠Mash
What about a third party...?
[k]

＠Mash
Some mysterious character who's still[sr]hiding out in the Kogetsukan somewhere?
[k]

＠Holmes
No need for such intricacies, Ms. Kyrielight. Occam's razor provides us with a perfectly reasonable explanation.
[k]

＠Holmes
There is a character here who needs to use his left hand...thanks to the injury he suffered on his right.
[k]

？1：Hey, yeah...!

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mash
Morris!
[k]

＠Holmes
Most likely, Sheringham noticed Morris's injured right hand and requested the left-handed cup out of consideration.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
But then, why would Sheringham feel a need to hide his meeting with Morris from Chris?
[k]

＠Holmes
Ah, but there I am afraid you have it backwards, Ms. Kyrielight. Sheringham wasn't trying to hide Morris from Chris.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Holmes
It was Chris that he was trying to hide from Morris, in point of fact. At least, he wished to hide that Chris was bringing the tea.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Holmes
Chris was also the one responsible for Morris's injured hand, after all. Sheringham would have known that so much as hearing Chris's voice could easily put Morris in a foul mood.
[k]

＠Holmes
And as a detective, he would also be well aware that information often freely given is all but impossible to drag out of someone when they are in a foul mood.
[k]

＠Mash
But, Morris never said anything[sr]about meeting with Sheringham...
[k]

＠Holmes
Given what [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1] has told us so far,[sr]we know that Morris is both distrustful and simpleminded.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Holmes
It is no surprise that he would try to hide[sr]his meeting with someone who is now dead.
[k]

＠Holmes
Speaking up now would only arouse suspicion. Even Morris no doubt realizes others are prone to think the worst of him.

＠Holmes
Be sure to keep everything we discussed in mind as you go about investigating this incident. Remember, you are assuming the role of another person.

＠Holmes
Even if you cannot take any decisive action yourself, you can still keep a close eye on the events that play out around you. You'd do well not to forget that.
