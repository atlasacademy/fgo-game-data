(Munch, munch...) Oh, I know what this one is.[sr]It's salmon.
[k]

？1：Be funny if Fionn caught it for Cat to cook.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Ooh... Maybe it'll make me wiser then.
[k]

？2：I got shrimp and mayonnaise myself.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Are the shrimp very fresh here in Luluhawa? They certainly look better than the ones at Chaldea.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Come to think of it, this is the first time we've gone on a real trip rather than a Rayshift, isn't it.
[k]

＠Mash
This isn't just a simulation. This is a real beach,[sr]in the real tropics...and here we are...
[k]

？1：I'm glad this Singularity happened in Hawaii.

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
Master...let's not lose focus.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Mash
Remember, once we've defeated the Foreigner, and hopefully completed our book in time for ServantFes...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
...it'll be time for us to go back to Chaldea. We shouldn't forget that part of our mission, Senpai.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
...Hehe.
[k]

？2：We're actually on vacation.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
...Y-yes, I suppose you're right.[sr]Hearing you say it like that...
[k]

＠Mash
...it really does make me feel...like we're on vacation...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
I mean, I suppose putting on a swimsuit[sr]will have that effect, but still...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
Before was a race...and before that, a desert island.
[k]

＠Mash
No matter what strange things happen,[sr]we always find a way to enjoy ourselves in summer.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Someday, when you look back on[sr]this long and arduous battle...
[k]

＠Mash
...I hope you'll remember the fun[sr]times as much as the bad ones.
[k]

＠Mash
...And I hope I'm not imposing[sr]on you by sharing that, either.
[k]

？1：Not at all.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
That's a relief...
[k]

？2：Thank you, Mash.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Not at all. I'm the one who should be thanking you.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
Well, shall we head back to the hotel?
[k]

＠Mash
Alter should be just about finished by now.
