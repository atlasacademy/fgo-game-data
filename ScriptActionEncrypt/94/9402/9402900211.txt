Oh... Look, [%1].[sr]That is the Holy Grail I prepared for this event.

That accursed King of Heroes must have fitted it to his championship belt. But it should still work fine!

Take it for yourself, [%1].[sr]I have no need of it.

I am the one who secured it in the first place, after all, and it would be completely improper for an event's proprietor to go home with its grand prize.

？2：Then I'll just use it on you.

(Perhaps it is due to my mother and that poison affair...but Holy Grails make me nervous...)
