＠Mordred
The hell's going on here!?[sr]They just keep coming no matter how many we kill!
[k]

＠Mordred
And what the hell is this? He's weirdly hard to fight![sr]It's like one minute it's a Saber, then an Archer...

It is most likely all of them!

He's using data from all seven of our classes[sr]to give himself an advantage against us!

＠Chiron
It is one of the fundaments of combat!
[k]

＠Chiron
In battle, you strike at your opponent's weaknesses,[sr]and make the battle as difficult for them as possible.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Chiron
...But, with that in mind...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Chiron
...there is no reason we can't do the same.

＠Chiron
Sir Sieg, Master, please keep the orders coming!
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chiron
The Greater Grail is basing its[sr]pseudo-combatants on our battle data.
[k]

＠Chiron
It must be choosing classes and tactics[sr]depending on the current situation.
[k]

＠Chiron
Fair enough. Then let's do this:
[k]

＠Chiron
Have all thirteen of us and Sir Sieg work together.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Chiron
If Darnic's residual thoughts refuse to shut down of their own accord, we will just have to overwhelm them with combat data until they collapse in on themselves!

...But, no matter. If that is our plan,[sr]I'll go ahead and use the walls to make more golems.

The lines between good and evil are ill-defined in this.[sr]We are not fighting as proper Servants, either.

＠Siegfried
...But then again, there has never[sr]been such a thing as a perfect person.

Instead of lamenting that which we lack, let us fight here and now for that which we already possess!

[charaFace C 6]
＠Sieg
Well, I was so caught up in my own[sr]responsibility to fix this predicament...
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Sieg
...that I forgot they have their[sr]own responsibilities as heroes.
[k]

＠Sieg
Even if they are just copies, they still have pride.[sr]Without that, a Servant is no more than a shadow.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]
＠Sieg
[%1], we need your orders now more than ever.
[k]

＠Sieg
This is the final battle, the last chance we'll[sr]likely ever have to fight by each other's sides.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Sieg
It'll be sad to go our separate ways,[sr]but it's time to wake from this dream.
