If you're looking for the handsome guy in the red coat, I think the Drama Queen and Tamamo Alter (*normal Tamamo) took him away.

I think you're thinking of “grotesque.”

I've heard it originated as a deviation from “grotta,” which means “cave.”

Though of course, its meaning has changed significantly over time.

At any rate, as long as Tamamo and Emiya are there, I'm sure they'll keep things from going off the rails[line 2]
