In that case...[bgm BGM_EVENT_4 0.1]it seems that I must be the one to[sr]go after her, since I am the least susceptible.

＠General Setsubun
My apologies, Master, but it is bound to be unstable up there, so I cannot bring you with me. Please wait here until I return.
[k]

？1：I'm sorry. I suppose it's all up to you, General.
？2：Just don't be TOO hard on her, okay?
