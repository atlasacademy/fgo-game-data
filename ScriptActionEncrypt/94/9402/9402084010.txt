I-if I were receiving a gift like this...my heart would all but burst with surprise and reverence. I would faint on the spot.

It was... Yes, it was yesterday.[sr]I was agonizing over how to prepare my chocolates.

What is the matter, Nitocris? Tell me why the sky should be so gloomy in the presence of the shining sun?
[k]

＠Ozymandias
You may control the darkness of the netherworld, but you are also the reincarnation of the Sky God, Horus. Never forget that.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
I am the sun, and will not permit the sky to look so somber. Look up, and tell me your troubles.

＠Ozymandias
Reveal what troubles your mind to me.[sr]What pain plagues you?

＠C：Nitocris
I thought about giving my ally a present, but...
[k]

[charaFace C 8]

＠C：Nitocris
...if it ends up being similar to the other Servants' gifts,[sr]I worry it would not live up to the expected quality and grandeur of a gift from a pharaoh.
[k]

＠C：Nitocris
That thought has been stuck in my head...and now I am at a standstill...

[charaFace C 7]

＠C：Nitocris
I attempted to make something with chocolate,[sr]but the result was far from satisfactory...

[charaFace B 8]

＠Ozymandias
Hm. Is that so?

[charaFace B 6]

＠Ozymandias
This is a sentiment that I do not fully understand, but if you feel that way, then it must be so.

[charaFace B 0]

＠Ozymandias
Fine. Then bring the fruits of your labor to me!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Ozymandias
I will bless them with my luminescence! Haha, as my gift to you! It may end up turning into a priceless treasure... Who knows!

Pharaoh...both my chocolates and myself[sr]are unworthy of such generosity!

Nitocris. I have already decided!

B-but...but...!

Enough! Now, come, hand them over to me! Come!

My chocolates, blessed with the great Ozymandias's majestic divinity, transformed into tiny versions of the great Medjed right before my eyes.
[k]

＠Nitocris
I didn't mean to... It wasn't intentional...
[k]

＠Nitocris
I-it was probably because the Spirit Origin in this sacred garment has deep ties with the great Medjed... Yes... That must be it...
