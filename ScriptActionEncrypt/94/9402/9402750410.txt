I can't put my finger on it, but there's just something...invigorating about this place!

＠Ushiwakamaru
I don't have many fond memories of the ocean, but I really like it here at Luluhawa. It's enough to make me want to go swimming!

Good morning, Senpai. Did you sleep well last night?
[k]

＠Mash
There was so much exciting commotion coming from Waikiki Street that I couldn't get to sleep myself...
[k]

＠Mash
It looks like they hold a festival every night. It's so peaceful, and there's laughter everywhere you go...
[k]

＠Mash
I guess this is just what life in the tropics is like. I can see why so many people come here to unwind.

Very salty, though. I wonder if having[sr]so much salt at once is a good idea...

[charaFace D 6]

Aw, why not! We're on vacation, after all! Plus, there's no Benkei here to nag me about my cholesterol! All right, it's meat time!

Usually this cat's much more pawticular about how she prepares her carrots, but in this joint, it's all about quantity over quality.

After all, this cat's also a maid, and here in Luluhawa, buffets are what's MAID to order!

＠Robin Hood
Well, either way, I've got no complaints about the nosh. So from now on, we'll be starting every day with breakfast right here!
[k]

＠Robin Hood
They say it's the most important meal of the day and all, so tucking in here oughta give us plenty of energy for the rest of the day.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
As for what we do during the day, that's up to Master. We could hang out at the beach, go shopping...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
It's only our second day here, so whatever we want to do, we have plenty of time. It's important that we just relax and enjoy Luluhawa.
[k]

？1：Sounds like a plan.

I thought something like this might happen, so I made sure to bring along a top-of-the-line camera.

＠Mash
If it's photos you want, then photos you'll get! Luluhawa landscapes... Senpai hiking up a mountain...

Senpai diving into the ocean... Senpai getting on the bus... Senpai eating a waffle dog...
