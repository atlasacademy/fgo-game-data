...No, not a problem. It's just that[sr]she's in a very...unique environment.

It would be much better if you could[sr]save her, rather than defeat her.

Are you ready to leave?[sr]Then let us head for Kilauea.

It's still an active volcano, making it one of Hawaii's biggest tourist attractions.

It's also where Pele lives.

You could even buy a bunch of Pele merch[sr]at the nearby visitor center if you want.

At least I can grab lunch in Waikiki,[sr]but dinner's just too expensive...

And not only do they not accept Galactic Police Dollars here, I can't exchange for local currency...

So now I've got to work part-time at the hotel in the morning just to be able to afford lunch...
