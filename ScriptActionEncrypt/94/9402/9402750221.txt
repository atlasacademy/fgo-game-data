Well, that's just not nice.

？！

＠Blackbeard
Anyway, since you won,[sr]I'll keep my word and help you out.
[k]

＠Blackbeard
Start by heading for that hotel over there.[sr]It's one of Waikiki's finest.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Blackbeard
If you hurry, you'll be able to get the special ServantFes deal of a hundred thousand BB Bucks a night!
[k]

？1：I have no idea if that's a good deal.
？！

＠Blackbeard
Anyway, that's your only option. All the other hotels are completely booked because ServantFes.

So those are the only lodgings available to us, hmm.[sr]Although...[wt 0.4][charaFace C 0] Teach, that hotel over there...
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Am I mistaken, or is that the Shelton,[sr]the single largest resort hotel in Waikiki?

＠Blackbeard
Ayup. I'd reserved a room there for me and my old pirate crew to have a bit of drunken revelry, but then that smarmy Bartholomew was all...
[k]

＠Blackbeard
“Sorry, Teach, but I already reserved the five-star place next door. If I see you at the con, you and I don't know each other, 'kay?”
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠Blackbeard
Guh, it still makes me mad! Anyway, that's why I'm not staying at that hotel myself now. Too fancy for me.

Wonderful! Thank you, Lord Teach![sr]I had the wrong idea about you!
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Come, Master, let us hurry there,[sr]before Lord Teach changes his mind!
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
We can rest assured that that hotel[sr]is a first-class institution!
