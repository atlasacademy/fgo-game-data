＠Gilles de Rais
Ahhh... What a wonderful, sacrilegious sensation. Blasphemy! Blasphemy, I say! This must not be real!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Gilles de Rais
Ah, but it is! We cannot turn a blind eye to it! Because the natural laws of the world have already been disgraced!
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
There's no need to play at being virtuous.[sr]I see the truth in the way you tremble.
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
Now, show me. Show me how you are going to reach for the flesh of immorality...your tongue stretching for that sweet nectar of the fallen!
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
Now...come...coooommmmeee!!!
[k]

？1：Um...
？2：What are you doing? (Creeped out)
？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠Gilles de Rais
Why, if it isn't Master.[sr]How odd, seeing you at this late hour.
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
You ask what I was doing,[sr]and the answer should be obvious...
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
I was amusing myself with forbidden heresy.

Well, the heresy itself is being committed by my grimoire here, and the one who called for this spell to be cast was the empress of this place.
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
I am merely a researcher,[sr]just like the rest of us here.

＠Mash
...Um, what exactly are you supposed to be doing?
[k]

＠Mash
Depending on your answer, I may need to consult Chaldea's code of ethics to determine what future assignments you may receive.

Hm... Rather than just TELLING you about it, perhaps you would like to look into this magical circle of death, despair, and desolation.
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
What do you see?
[k]

？1：Th-this is...!

[charaFace B 1]
＠Gilles de Rais
Yes, it's a fresh, just-summoned object that appeared as if it had just been exhumed from its grave.
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
What do you think?[sr]Truly, truly, truly delicious-looking, no!?
[k]

？2：It's chocolate!

Do not fret, Mash. Forbidden though this thing may be,[sr]it is not dangerous to anyone.
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
This is an act of good that even Jeanne would be proud of. It's lawful-good, even!
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
Were I to give this ritual a name,[sr]it would be...recycling!
[k]

？1：???
？！

[charaFace B 1]
＠Gilles de Rais
We are merely using the concept[sr]of discarded, uneaten chocolate.
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
Reviving chocolates that have died, so to speak. Necromancy...or, rather...chocomancy!
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
The empress suggested this, so we have made it reality. Our research here is in the furtherance of that goal.

Hahaha... I am merely here in answer to her call, to her willingness to do anything for more chocolate. It is an endeavor of mutual interest, to be sure!
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Gilles de Rais
After all, if the supply of chocolate does not stabilize in Chaldea, there will be no material for Jeanne to use! So there would not be any chocolates for me!
[k]

＠Gilles de Rais
There could be no Luminosite Chocolanelle[sr]or La Grondement Du Choco....

I don't know that I agree with what they're doing,[sr]but I understand their logic now...I think...

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Do you think research like this is a good idea?
[k]

？1：Well...recycling isn't a bad thing...
？！

＠Mash
Yes...you're right. If they aren't causing trouble,[sr]I suppose this is just yet another means of producing more chocolate...
