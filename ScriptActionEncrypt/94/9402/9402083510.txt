Why, if it isn't Master. What's going on?
[k]

？1：You haven't done anything funny, have you?
？！

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
Haha. What kind of question is that?[sr]I've only been doing things that I should be doing.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
Huh? What would that be, you ask?[sr]Earnest effort, I tell ya.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
Like speaking with the queen with the furry ears...or observing the shining golden King of Heroes from afar... You know, that sort of thing.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
I don't know how to put it, but that kind of thing seems appropriate in a place like Chaldea.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
After all, I'm your Servant.[sr]I haven't forgotten.
[k]


？1：...That's all right then. Here you go!

Oh?

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
Ah...ah! These are...chocolates. Heh. Thanks.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
You know what, when I take a good look at these chocolates, they actually are kinda moving.

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
Who knew that cacao would turn into this...[sr]If I had only known... (Mumble, mumble)
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
Well, I suppose it's too late to regret things now. I should not dwell on the past, but set my sights to the future...to my destination!
[k]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
Don't worry, I'll give you something in return later on. Come back and see me again soon, Master.

Ah, there you are.

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
That return gift I mentioned the other day...[sr]It's waiting for you in that room over there.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
I didn't know what to get you, but I figured it'd be best to get the sort of thing you'd expect from me...
[k]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
That's right, supply and demand[sr]is the most important thing.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
My motto is this: even if we might have gotten our wires crossed a little bit, if the customer is happy, then just go with it.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
But I'll have you know, I shaped my gift[sr]in what I think is the correct way.
[k]

？1：...?
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
Ha ha! Just go and see for yourself! Eat them, take a picture of them... Do whatever you want with them, Master.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
But...let me warn you about something.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 402500:Rider of the Resistance:Columbus]
When you go in there, try to[sr]be as quiet as possible, okay?
