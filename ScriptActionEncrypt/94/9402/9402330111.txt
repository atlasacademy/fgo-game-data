That should do it.[sr]I'm glad this rescue was successful.

＠Chiron
Now, let's get out of here, shall we?

？1：What about Fafnir...?

[charaFace B 4]
＠Chiron
Yes...he was just attacked with a number of Noble Phantasms...but he seems to be no worse for wear.

＠Chiron
No wonder he's been the one keeping care of[sr]the Holy Grail. He's certainly quite durable.
[k]

？2：He still needs our help!

＠Chiron
Not to worry.[sr]Another Servant will be along soon to help him.

＠Chiron
I'm not sure what you know[sr]about our current predicament...
[k]

＠Chiron
...but I can explain that all once we are safe.
[k]

＠Chiron
Come, let us hurry to the fortress.
