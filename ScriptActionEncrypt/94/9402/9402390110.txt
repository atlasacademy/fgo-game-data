＠Holmes
Have you ever seen a face where you oughtn't to? In a stain on the ceiling, or the wood grain on a wall, or even a scuff mark on a desk, perhaps?

...Hmm, you have, eh?[sr]That is certainly no surprise.

It is human nature to seek patterns, to find meaning[sr]and make connections, whether real or imagined.

＠Holmes
To be quite frank, this is all a mistake.[sr]An illusion. A mismatch owing to human perception.
[k]

＠Holmes
People inevitably favor their own thoughts and ideas over anyone else's. To be human is to be forever out of reach of true objectivity.
[k]

＠Holmes
Now, let me tell you the tale of a curious group[sr]of people and their subjective mistakes.

This is a tragedy of two families...

...one that may have begun when bonds were mistakenly believed to exist among those attending a certain gathering.

This story has no real relevance to you,[sr]and might have taken place anywhere...

Oh, just a little unorthodox treatment.

I thought it might be a good way for [%1] to rehabilitate their memory, you see.

All right, tell me, [%1].

＠Hawthorne
How is your memory doing now that you've[sr]met everyone from both families?
[k]

？1：What's the Marble Company?

？！

[charaFace C 4]

＠Hawthorne
Hmm... Not so well, I see. They're some of[sr]the most famous people in the business world.
[k]

It's even said that any contract they're[sr]present for will never, ever be broken.

The Marble Company doesn't just own the Kogetsukan, they even own the island it's on. So you never have to worry about unwanted visitors out here.
[k]

＠Hawthorne
Of course, that also means if they DID steal the necklace, we would have no hope of getting it back.
[k]

＠Juliet
I think we can trust them, don't you?[sr]Trust IS everything for them, after all.

I'm sure that necklace wasn't cheap, but it couldn't possibly be worth ruining their reputation.

？1：Sounds like they really ARE impressive.

？！

＠Juliet
They have clients all over the world, so that DOES give them a lot of power. Neither of our families could hope to match them, even if we combined forces.
[k]

＠Juliet
Of course, we wouldn't have[sr]asked them to be here otherwise.

＠Juliet
While we're on the subject, Ann is the company's second in command, and despite his young age, Wǔ is one of the top five most powerful people in the company.

＠Wǔ
But even if I couldn't keep an eye on it the whole time,[sr]I would've noticed if any lechers had tried to get in.
[k]

＠Wǔ
From what I remember, Ms. Harriet[sr]and Ms. Eva went in first.
[k]

＠Wǔ
Then Ms. Dorothy and Ms. Laurie went in just[sr]as Ms. Harriet and Ms. Eva were leaving.
[k]

＠Wǔ
I'm pretty sure nobody else went in after[sr]Ms. Dorothy and Ms. Laurie came out.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

Though I sure didn't expect to see Ms. Dorothy back again so soon. Especially not looking like she was ready to carve me up.
