Yep. Normally, my Spirit Origin would've been made into the Holy Grail's Servant...
[k]

＠Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu)
...and I would've been forced to do its bidding.
[k]

＠Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu)
But right before I was Servantized, I cut off a bit of my Spirit Origin to prevent that.

Usually that sort of thing would be impossible.

But after everything that transpired last time, Nobukatsu happened to be inscribed near my own Spirit Origin.

＠Oda Nobukatsu (with Nobbu)
I therefore rented out a bit of space in his[sr]Spirit Origin so I could manifest, too!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠D：Oda Nobukatsu
Usually, my Spirit Origin would be[sr]too weak to materialize at all...

[charaFace D 12]

Still, this was an all-star team technique. It only worked because Nobukatsu and I are actual siblings.

That said, this Spirit Origin is a little small for me, so it's kind of cramped in here. Can't do anything about that, though!

Oryou's actually my Noble Phantasm, you see. Once I was back up to snuff, she was able to maintain her form again.
