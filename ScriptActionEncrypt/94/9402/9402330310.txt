I thought...it was horrible.
[k]

＠Jack
Yes, we guess it was.[sr]But why does it bother you, Mr. Custodian?
[k]

＠Jack
Why would other people's pasts[sr]or memories matter to you?
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Sieg
Well, I care...
[k]

＠Sieg
I wanted to save all of you.
[k]

＠Jack
Even though we're here now[sr]because you couldn't save us?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Sieg
...That's true. You're right about that.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Sieg
Hmm, what's the expression for this again?[sr]I think it's...
[k]

＠Jack
Feeling down?
[k]

[charaFace D 8]
＠Sieg
Not exactly, but it's close...
[k]


＠Jack
At a loss for words?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Sieg
That's it.
[k]

＠Jack
We see. So we lost.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Sieg
Well, technically speaking,[sr]I wasn't the one who beat you...
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Sieg
...but I WAS there when you fell.
[k]

＠Jack
That's okay. We were fighting a Holy Grail[line 2]a Great Holy Grail War, right?
[k]

＠Jack
Everybody tries to kill everybody else in those.
[k]

＠Jack
But, we were on the Black team, right?[sr]So why were we fighting you?
[k]

＠Jack
Didn't Mr. Chiron say you were on the Black team too?
[k]

＠Sieg
...It's kind of a long story.[sr]Do you still want to hear it?
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Jack
Nuh-uh!
[k]

＠Sieg
Got it.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Sieg
Why don't we talk about something else, then?[sr]How does that sound?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

Sure![sr]As long as it's not about doctors or London!
[k]

[charaFace D 6]

All right then, let's see...[sr]I know, what about food?

All right, our plan for tonight is essentially the same as yesterday. We will lure three enemy Servants out and distract the others so they don't interfere.

But tonight, I won't ask Sir Sieg and Master [%1] to handle the three Servants all on their own.

Hm? Ah, it's no big deal. I can tell you're a good Master from the way you fought last night.

So, y'know, it just makes sense for[sr]me to take my orders from you!
[k]

But hey, don't worry about me.[sr]You don't need to change anything you're doing.

Just keep following your own path,[sr]and I'll clear the way for you.

I never thought I'd end up fighting alongside him.[sr]This should make for some good memories.

？！

Well, yeah. It's nice having memories like this, isn't it? Far as I'm concerned, you can never have too many.

Especially in my case,[sr]since I don't have all that many to begin with.

It's great that all three Servants we defeated came over to our side. That's certainly the best outcome we could've wished for.

But...that's also why I'm worried.[charaFace D 4]

I can't see us having that kind of luck twice.
