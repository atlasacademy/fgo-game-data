So let's not worry so much about[sr]that and just enjoy our summer!

？1：Does that go for all the Servants, too?
？！

[charaFace C 0]

＠Da Vinci
Pretty much. They said if the staff was getting a summer vacation, the Heroic Spirits deserved one too.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
With normal summoning methods, it'd be impossible[sr]for a Servant to wander off without their Master.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But using Chaldea's summoning method, each Servant can carry around the magical energy they need to materialize, kind of like a battery pack.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Da Vinci
I don't know who Blackbeard learned that from, but he would not leave me alone once he did. By the time I gave in, he was groveling pretty shamelessly, teary-eyed and runny-nosed.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The really weird part is that all the other Servants felt the same and demanded their own summer vacation, complete with bonus.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So that's why there are so few Servants left here now. All the rest are out living it up.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Da Vinci
But hey, Holmes and I are still here, and we can always bring the rest back by force if we have to.
