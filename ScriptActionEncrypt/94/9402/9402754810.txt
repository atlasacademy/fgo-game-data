'Course it did. It's too bad I ran out of time at the end and couldn't polish it as much as I wanted...

[charaFace D 11]
＠D：Jeanne Alter
...but aside from that it was pretty kick-ass.[sr]I'm positive it turned out great.

＠D：Jeanne Alter
Now...ooopen sesame![sr]Let's see how this spicy masterpiece turned out!

I'm sure the inside is just as awesome!

It tells an epic, gripping tale just brimming with spectacle and suspense! It's far greater than the sum of its parts!

＠Ushiwakamaru
This is great. I've always liked destined duels.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Ushiwakamaru
Of course, in my case, the duels I fought were all over in a flash, so I never experienced much in the way of drama.

＠C：Robin Hood
(Sigh) This is exactly why I hate overpowered heroes.
[k]

＠C：Robin Hood
They have no idea what it's like to go through life laying traps, preparing poisons, or crawling around in stinky bogs, just to survive another day.

＠C：Robin Hood
That said...I might not have any interest[sr]in fighting a duel to the death myself...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠C：Robin Hood
...but I can tell this kind of story'll be a big hit. It's pretty badass, and that Indian king movie is awesome.

＠Ushiwakamaru
So this book should suit the tastes[sr]of people like Lord Robin and myself.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Perhaps that means it has universal appeal[line 2]the kind that will create quite a buzz for our book.
