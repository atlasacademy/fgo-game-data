...[&He:She] finally came out of the cafeteria.[sr]I knew I'd be able to catch [&him:her] if I staked it out at lunch.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
I would have preferred to do it after dinner,[sr]but then there would be more people around.
[k]

[charaFace A 22]

＠Ereshkigal
Okay. The time has finally come.
[k]

[charaFace A 21]

＠Ereshkigal
...Ha. Not bad.[sr]I'm actually surprised how calm I am.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ereshkigal
Spending two days mentally preparing myself must have paid off. And, of course, my chocolate turned out great.
[k]

[charaFace A 19]

＠Ereshkigal
Luckily, I had a whole month to practice. There should be no complaint about taste, presentation, strength of the charm, anything!
[k]

[charaFace A 25]

＠Ereshkigal
Making one prototype every day was also fun![sr]I would keep doing it if I could!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ereshkigal
Well...I suppose this IS the only one that turned out well... But if even one turned out perfectly, I can say this venture was a success!

The sound of those footsteps...it's definitely [%1]. Stay cool... Stay graceful...
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Okay, let's do this, Ereshkigal! Time to demonstrate the grace and composure of a goddess!

[charaFace A 11]

Y-yes. Thank you for such a formal greeting. I agree that formalities are very important, and that is something I like about you.

[charaFace A 7]

＠Fou
Fou.[sr]Foufou.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

I-I-I knew that. You just left the cafeteria,[sr]after all! A common thing for the living to do!
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Ereshkigal
(Awawa! What happened to your calm and focus, Ereshkigal!? I thought I had this!)

？！

＠Fou
Fou. Kyukyuuu, fou. (Special translation:[sr]But you haven't eaten dessert yet.)
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Ereshkigal
Is that so!? Well then my timing is excellent!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Ereshkigal
So, it would be a shame if you skipped dessert...
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
And I don't think you're going to get any from the other goddesses. Well, since we're following modern traditions...

I-I only realized this was coming up just yesterday, and this is just k-kind of an everyday design for me, and I didn't give it much thought or anything...

Yes, that's right.[sr]Those spear cages are very, very important to me.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
...Teehee. They trap human souls,[sr]and they impale my enemies.
[k]

[charaFace A 18]

＠Ereshkigal
What a strange human you are,[sr]understanding their importance to me.
[k]

？2：These are what you're best at, right?

[charaFace A 11]

＠Ereshkigal
Th-that's right. Making cages is second nature to me. As you know, I am the gloomy goddess of the underworld.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Ereshkigal
You always seem to forget that, so I thought I would make my chocolates into this shape to remind you.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Ereshkigal
Remember, every time you see that chocolate...remember to never underestimate me.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 11]

＠Ereshkigal
...Ahem.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
W-well, you don't have to eat it immediately.[sr]You can eat it whenever you feel like it.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
A-and it would be okay if you came...and visited me when you ran out. I...made extras...just in case.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
“I've never tasted anything like this in my life! It's too perfect, I'm never going to be able to eat anything but chocolate from the underworld!”
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
...I would be responsible for you feeling that way,[sr]so I have planned for that eventuality as well.

[charaFace A 11]

＠Ereshkigal
D-don't be so stupid. There are more calories in that chocolate than a human needs in an entire lifetime.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Th-that would last you through a blizzard on a mountain. Y-you couldn't possibly eat it in one day.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
I appreciate the thought, but come back later if you want more. In about two weeks, actually.
