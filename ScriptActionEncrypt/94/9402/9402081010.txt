Why? My hypothesis should be correct.

[charaFace A 4]

...The Throne definitely exists.
[k]

＠Semiramis
A place where chocolate heroes,[sr]who once existed and were engraved in history...
[k]

＠Semiramis
Chocolates that dictators loved, chocolates that once saved the life of an accomplished adventurer, hostile chocolates that killed hundreds...
[k]

＠Semiramis
With this spell, I should be able to download their records from the Throne and perform a summoning.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Semiramis
My formula is correct. I have made no errors.[sr]Yet why...why doesn't it work!?
[k]

＠Semiramis
I should be able to connect to it. Is there something else that is missing? What would that be!?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Semiramis
My instincts tell me...it's power. Simple, raw power.[sr]Not magical energy, nor physical power...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

The devastating power to pry open reason and destroy fate and logic... THAT is what I lack!

I even heard those guys have the audacity to create their own chocolate and replace the divine cacao this heroine worked so hard to purrcure!

The point of this ritual was to have the Choco-Spirits fight each other, then take advantage of the energy that the fallen expend in trying to return to the Throne...!

And the end result...was THIS!
