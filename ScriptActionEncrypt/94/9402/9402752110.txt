Oh, before I forget... I'm not thinking about how my victory here might affect my ServantFes sales, but...
[k]

＠Medb
...since Holy Grails are all about giving people what they want...and if what the people want is me, well... You do see where I'm going with this, right?
[k]

＠Medb
I should thank that BB chick sometime[sr]for giving me this perfect opportunity.
[k]

＠Medb
Like they say, third time's the charm. This time, I'll finally take the Holy Grail for myself and use it to turn this island into my ideal Slaveland.
[k]

[charaFace F 8]
＠Medb
Well, see you at ServantFes, I guess. Obviously I'm going to grab the most sales by far, but who knows?
[k]

＠Medb
Maybe you guys'll do really well and manage to sell almost a tenth as many books as me. Ahahahaha!

It's my duty as a tengu to punish the wicked![sr]I must pelt her with cheese until she repents!
