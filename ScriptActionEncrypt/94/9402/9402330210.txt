I'll tell you his True Name once he returns. First, I need to bring you up to speed on what has been happening here.

Gladly. Once the morning comes,[sr]I will tell you everything I know.

I see, I see...[sr]Very well then, let me explain everything else.[charaFace B 0]
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_85 0.1]

＠Chiron
To begin, this is not like a typical Holy Grail War.
[k]

＠Chiron
It does not involve seven Masters trying to kill one another, nor even seven classes of Servants with which to do so.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Chiron
...Ah, so you have no experience with that sort of Holy Grail War. Well, trust me when I say that that is usually how these things go.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Chiron
Now I hope you're paying attention;[sr]this WILL be on the test.
[k]

＠Chiron
Now, this Great Holy Grail War uses the Greater Grail's emergency system from Fuyuki to wage war with fourteen Servants rather than the customary seven.
[k]

＠Chiron
That is to say, it is a battle between[sr]two teams of seven Servants.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chiron
...However, that war had in fact already concluded,[sr]with Fafnir emerging as the apparent victor.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Chiron
That is how he came into possession[sr]of the Greater Grail.
[k]

＠Chiron
As for us, we are reproductions of the Servants who were summoned during that Great Holy Grail War.
[k]

？1：Reproductions...?
？！

＠Chiron
In this world, the only two places that exist are the city of Trifas, and of course the Hanging Gardens.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Chiron
...I suppose you could call[sr]this a sort of simulation.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Chiron
Aha. That seems to have helped you understand.
[k]

＠Chiron
Indeed, this is all one enormous simulation field designed to recreate that Great Holy Grail War.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chiron
We were originally imitation life-forms, going through the motions of battle without thought or emotion.
[k]

＠Chiron
However, as this seemingly endless simulation repeated itself, something unexpected happened.
[k]

＠Chiron
Namely, we developed intelligence, reason,[sr]and even regained our memories as Servants.
[k]

＠Chiron
That being said, we do not remember anything about the Great Holy Grail War.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Chiron
You might say that I'm starting over from scratch.[sr]At least as a Servant.
[k]

＠Chiron
It's only in this tiny world that we become[sr]something close to real Servants.
[k]

＠Chiron
Do you understand everything we've covered so far?[sr]If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.
[k]



？1：What sort of enemy are we up against?

[flag _sel01a 1]

？2：Who is that dragon, anyway?

[charaFace B 4]
＠Chiron
They are reproductions, just as we are. Unlike us, though, they have nothing in the way of intellect or reason...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chiron
...but what they do have are sheer numbers.
[k]

＠Chiron
Of the fourteen Servants who were originally summoned to the Great Holy Grail War, we now face twelve.
[k]

？1：That many!?
？！

＠Chiron
Yes, that many.
[k]

＠Chiron
As we are all starting from scratch, I'm afraid I don't know any of their True Names other than the Rider on our side...
[k]

＠Chiron
...but I believe the evil dragon does.

[charaFace B 0]
＠Chiron
His name is Fafnir.[sr]He seems to be this Greater Grail's Custodian.
[k]

＠Chiron
There is not a shred of doubt that he was the Great Holy Grail War's victor.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Chiron
Though I'm afraid I have no idea how he secured his victory, or what he is doing in a place like this.
[k]

[branch l_selend _sel01a 1]

[flag _sel01a 1]

[label l_selend]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Chiron
As the Custodian, he would like this[sr]Greater Grail to stop simulating this war.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Chiron
By rights, we should be helping him...but unfortunately, our enemies are just too strong.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chiron
What's more, we have not a moment to waste.
[k]

＠Chiron
The other Servants have learned how to use their[sr]Noble Phantasms, despite still lacking consciousness.
[k]

＠Chiron
And that brings us to the final stage of the tens of thousands of battles to the death we fourteen Servants have fought.
[k]

＠Chiron
We have no choice but to repeat this battle.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Chiron
And yet, the more we fight,[sr]the worse the situation becomes.
[k]

？1：How did you and Rider become conscious?
？！

＠Chiron
A good question.[sr]We wondered about that ourselves for a time...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chiron
It is our belief now that the Custodian altered the simulation's parameters to make us into proper Servants.
[k]

＠Chiron
As the Greater Grail's Custodian, it should be well within his capabilities to recreate us in this world.
[k]

＠Chiron
...Though it also seems he hesitated[sr]to do so until the very last moment.
[k]

＠Chiron
Had he not, we may have had[sr]a few more allies on our side.
[k]

？1：How about just not fighting?
？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Chiron
I'm afraid that would be difficult.[sr]There is nowhere to seek refuge in this world.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chiron
Though you were fortunate enough to survive tonight,[sr]there is no telling what tomorrow may hold.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Chiron
They did not attack this fortress only because of the new, unexpected elements that you and Fafnir represent in the current situation.
[k]

＠Chiron
Most likely, that was simply a function of the battle simulation program, rather than any thought or strategy on their part.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Chiron
But the next time will be different.
[k]

＠Chiron
Next time, I expect they will account for Fafnir in their calculations, and mount an assault on this fortress.
[k]

[k]

＠Evil Dragon
I'm afraid that, being a dragon,[sr]I am more vulnerable to that attack than most.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
I never thought these reproductions would ever learn how to use their originals' Noble Phantasms...
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
To make matters worse, we have only two Servants allied with us... Though at least they're two extremely powerful A-rank ones.
[k]

？1：Did you make them into Servants?
？！

＠Evil Dragon
Yes, I did.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
The idea was to convert all fourteen reproductions into intelligent Servants and investigate who or what is making them fight...
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
...but that would have been a horrible decision.[sr]Besides, creating intelligent beings on a whim...
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
Such irresponsibility would have been too cruel.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
However, my hesitation has only ended up making the situation worse.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
I never thought they could use their Noble Phantasms despite lacking the capacity for thought...
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
So in a spur-of-the-moment decision, the best I could do was turn those two reproductions into Servants.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
Even so, I'm afraid that does[sr]nothing to lessen my own sins.
[k]

＠Evil Dragon
I am too wounded to be able to move[sr]in this form for the time being.

That would be like swatting a fly with a sledgehammer.[sr]Not to mention that the other eleven Servants are unlikely to simply wait patiently for their turn.

...I'm afraid I don't know anything about that. I can only assume those homunculi were made some other way.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Sieg
They do say that we[line 2]well, the Yggdmillennia production process was the work of a distinguished family of alchemists.
[k]

＠Sieg
As for me, an Yggdmillennia mage created[sr]me so that I could provide magical energy.
[k]

＠Sieg
...[charaFace D 0]It takes a vast amount of magical energy to keep[sr]a Servant materialized, to say nothing of using their Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Sieg
So there were a lot of other homunculi besides me who were all here at this fortress to provide the Servants with magical energy.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Sieg
Over half of them ended up wrung completely dry of magical energy and died...but I ran away.
[k]

＠Sieg
...All because I didn't want to die.
[k]

？1：...You say that like it's a bad thing.

[charaFace D 2]
＠Sieg
Ah...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Sieg
I guess...I would be lying if I said I didn't feel guilty.
[k]

＠Sieg
Both about abandoning everyone so I could[sr]survive...and that I am still alive now...
[k]

？2：Do you regret that?

＠Sieg
...That's a difficult question,[sr]but...I don't think so.[charaFace D 6]
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 6]
＠Sieg
This Greater Grail is precious. Every Servant who fought in the war risked their lives for it.
[k]

＠Sieg
I can't let it fall into the wrong hands.
