So instead of a five-story pagoda,[sr]we have a hundred-story pagoda, huh.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Of course, there's no way they pulled this off with standard architectural engineering.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If they'd tried, it would've come crashing down well before the fiftieth floor.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Anyway, we're still analyzing it, but I'm pretty sure this tower is Shuten-Douji's Noble Phantasm, “Multicolored Poison - Shinpen Kidoku.”
[k]

？1：I just...can't even with this...

[k]

＠Da Vinci
According to our observational data, Shuten-Douji's Noble Phantasm was the one it had the most in common with.

Looking at what things are like there, I'm guessing Shuten-Douji combined the magical energy source with her Noble Phantasm to build this tower.

Hmm. So this is your idea of “tipsy,” huh.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Getting light-headed, losing your sense of balance... Sounds more like “completely smashed” to me.

Sorry I couldn't make it the fun kind of tipsy. These things happen when you go and turn wine into a tower.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
But don't worry. It's not so bad as long[sr]as you make your way up the inside.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Sure it might wear you out a bit, but you'll probably be fine as long as you rest up and take turns along the way.

＠Shuten-Douji
Okay then, we'll be taking it niiice and easy[sr]on the top, waiting for you to show up...

Mwaha, MWA HA HA HA! ...Phew. I believe that should be enough laughter for now. I AM getting rather tired.

[charaTalk F]
I must say though, Shuten, do you not find it wasteful to use your delicious wine on such frivolity?

[charaTalk F]
I may not be as strong as you, but I can still hold my liquor quite well, you know. If you simply wanted someone to drink with, surely you and I could have suffice[line 2]

So it looks like Raikou's current state is a result of her breaking the rule not to climb the outer walls.
[k]

＠Mash
What's more, it looks like there is no way to completely avoid this exhaustion, even inside the tower.

Hmm. And we won't be able to determine exactly HOW intoxicated or exhausted you'll get in there until you actually start climbing.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So if you want to clear this tower as quickly as possible, you'll probably need to switch out your tired fighters for fresh ones as you go along.

＠Da Vinci
If worse comes to worst, we might even need to draw on Chaldea's entire Servant pool.

(Sigh) Wine...[sr]Why did it have to be wine?

...N-no, of course not. I will simply do[sr]the best I can under the circumstances.

Now, Master, let us begin! This will be our magnificent first step towards conquering this oni tower!

＠General Setsubun
My spirits are high, and my preparations are complete. There is nothing to worry about whatsoever.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
I shall lead by example, thus demonstrating to all who follow that General Setsubun is here!

？1：Wow, you ARE fired up! This is really reassuring!

＠General Setsubun
Thank you for your kind words, Master. I must confess,[sr]I get intoxicated at the faintest whiff of alcohol...

...but I am reasonably certain I can[sr]manage as long as I keep my spirits up!
