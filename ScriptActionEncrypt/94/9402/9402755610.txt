I don't know if it's just 'cause I'm looking at it with fresh eyes after passing out once we finished and the pressure was off...

It appears to be an entry in the genre where an unremarkable protagonist gets to know a number of very different heroines...aka the harem plot.

＠Mash
It includes elements that have been broadly popular since ancient times, making it a reliable choice!

In baseball terms, it's a fastball[sr]delivered straight down the middle.

＠Mash
In manga terms, it's one of the most essential genres to ever exist. So this book definitely has a shot at winning!

Romance has been part of even those most ancient stories, so I'm pretty sure no one's gonna be turning their noses up at it.

Now come on, it's time to head to the con!
