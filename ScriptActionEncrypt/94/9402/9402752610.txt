No surprise at this point, but making this book gets easier every time. We shouldn't have any trouble finishing it now.

...Hmm. Now that we're gonna have more free time,[sr]why don't we take a break and visit Kilauea?

＠Jeanne Alter
Uh, yeah. Like, completely different.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Mauna Kea's a dormant volcano,[sr]while Kilauea's still active.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
It's got lava, magma, smoke...all of it.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
What's more, people say that[sr]Pele lives near its mouth.
[k]

？1：Wow. Any other interesting stories?

？！

[charaFace B 7]

＠Jeanne Alter
Hmm... Let's see...
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Well, if we're talking Pele and volcanoes, then we also gotta cover the snow goddess Poliʻahu! She lives on Mauna Kea, but I bet you coulda guessed that.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
They say that whenever Pele tried to chase her away with lava, Poliʻahu would cover the lava up with snow, which is why it's so cold there.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
They say Poliʻahu always wore a white cloak,[sr]and that Pele had a black one.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Pele would frequently try to kill Poliʻahu,[sr]but would always end up getting outwitted.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
According to all the legends,[sr]Pele never managed to beat her once.
[k]

[charaFace B 13]

＠Jeanne Alter
Now that we're here in Hawaii and all,[sr]you oughta brush up on your Hawaiian mythology too.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I mean, that's the sort of knowledge[sr]we're gonna need in this battle, right?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Jeanne Alter
...Though to be fair, I never thought Pele[sr]would be mixed up in all this either.

＠Robin Hood
I heard they also went for the same kind of men.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
In one of the myths I read, Pele fell in love at first sight with a male demigod from Oahu by the name of Kamapuaʻa.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Kamapuaʻa had a beautiful singing voice, one that carried all the way to Pele's ears on the island of Hawaii.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Robin Hood
But when she went to meet him, she learned the truth: Kamapuaʻa was actually half man, half pig.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
They say Pele mocked him for being a pig,[sr]but that didn't stop her from marrying him.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]

＠Robin Hood
Don't know if it was the fact that she'd already fallen for him, or if she just didn't mind the pig side as much as she let on, but anyway.

＠Ushiwakamaru
...That doesn't surprise me. Pigs are smart, docile creatures who like to keep clean, yet can grow to be fearsome boars if left in the wild.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I can understand why some people don't care for pigs...but regardless, there aren't many gods who rule over them.
[k]

？1：So Pele married a pig, huh...
？2：Is this why BB wanted to turn you into a pig, Robin?
