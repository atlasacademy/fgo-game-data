Even I don't know many reckless fools who went from forming a club to making a book in less than a week!

But next time, make sure you submit[sr]your final draft with more time to spare.

[charaFace G 10]
＠Gorgeous P
Get your book done early[line 2]printed, bound, and what have you[line 2]and use the remaining time to make photocopies. That's the mark of a club that truly knows what it's doing.
