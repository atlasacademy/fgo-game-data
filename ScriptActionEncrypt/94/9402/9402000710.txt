＠Quetzalcoatl
Hello! This is the tower's halfway point, yes!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Can you guess what awaits you at this wonderful milestone? Get it right, and you'll win a fantastic prize, yes!
[k]

？1：I can see the ring, you know!
？2：Lucha. It's a lucha match. A lucha match awaits me.
？！

＠Quetzalcoatl
Thaaat's right! You just earned the privilege of competing in this ring, yes!
[k]

？1：Called it!

＠General Setsubun
Hmm. I have seen this before.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
One of the characters in my favorite fighting game has a home stage that looks like this. I often select this character when it is time to do battle.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠General Setsubun
He is a very muscular man, and it is a lot of fun to make him twirl his opponent and throw them around like...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠General Setsubun
I apologize. I have gotten rather off topic.

Ahem... Tell me, goddess from a foreign land,[sr]why do you side with these oni?

¡Es simple![sr]They scratch my back, so I scratch theirs.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
I don't want beating hearts and the like, no! But I WILL take other kinds of sacrifices! I am a goddess, you know!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
And just when I was getting a little down from not quite getting enough exercise, Shuten and Ibaraki came to me with something wonderful!
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Quetzalcoatl
They offered a place small enough to focus solely on lucha, on a floor at an altitude high enough to toughen up my heart and lungs...
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
...AND a situation where a bevy of opponents would show up all of their own accord. What more could I ask for?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Quetzalcoatl
Basically, it means I get student after[sr]student showing up to enroll, yes!

Ahh, an enclosed space where escape is not an option. This takes me back to my gladiator days! As such, the only choice I have left is to rebel!
[k]

＠Spartacus
Now come, hurt me. Injure me! I shall take everything you have, and rebel with love!

By the way, that vigilante Assassin is sitting this one out, yes.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
I still remember our promise, but it just didn't seem right to lump the Assassin in with the rest of my students, you know?
[k]

？1：I'm surprised how well Spartacus fits in here.

I suppose he is used to taking[sr]his opponents' attacks head-on.

Well, he was a gladiator, so he's probably used to fighting in rings like that...

So! The rules on this floor couldn't be simpler. No need to dredge up the past or worry about old acquaintances showing their faces here.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Quetzalcoatl
All you have to do is pin me for a three count, yes![sr]If you can't the stairs to the next floor will never open!
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
In other words: Buster x Buster x Buster.[sr]Simple, yes!?

I see. Then it really is simple.[sr]Essentially, all we need to do is defeat you.
[k]

？1：I'm surprised you knew the term “KO.”
？2：Sure, but that's easier said than done.
？！

[charaFace B 0]

＠General Setsubun
Indeed. I have KO'd many an[sr]opponent in my games of video.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
All I need to do here is use my[sr]arms instead of my controller.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
And although it is a bit embarrassing to admit this as a woman, I have every confidence in my physical strength.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠General Setsubun
Watch, Master, as I defeat every opponent who dares challenge me! I shall pound them all into the mat!
