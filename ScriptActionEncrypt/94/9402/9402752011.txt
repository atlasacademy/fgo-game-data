＠BB Pele
Phew, glad that's all settled.[sr]Thanks for the help, [%1].
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠BB
Pele's influence when I'm in this form is a little too strong for me when it comes to enemies of that type...
[k]

＠BB
It makes it so that, whenever I face a pig monster, I, uh...I end up destroying it so brutally that it makes everyone else cringe.
[k]

＠BB
And nobody wants to see that[sr]from a swimsuit-clad beauty, right...?
[k]

？1：Pele's influence, huh...
？2：Riiight. Had to be Pele. No other explanation.

？！

＠BB
Anyway, the night is saved now,[sr]and it's all thanks to you guys.
[k]

＠BB
I hope you continue to enjoy your stay in Luluhawa![sr]Of course, that goes for your doujin efforts too.

[charaFace B 6]
＠BB
Only two days to go until ServantFes, Jeanne Alter.
[k]

＠BB
I can't wait to see your finished,[sr]properly printed book.

I think that's almost certainly asking too much.

＠Ushiwakamaru
I may be an amateur when dealing with doujin, but I don't see any way for a newly formed club like ours to outperform skilled and seasoned veterans.

Yes, I know.[sr]It really is much easier said than done, isn't it.

？！

[charaFace B 13]
＠BB
Whoops! That's enough extra hint dropping!
[k]

＠BB
Anyway, this damaged street isn't going to repair itself. Why don't you all go back to the hotel and let little old me handle this?
[k]

＠BB
Enjoy your ServantFes time, Senpai♪

＠Jeanne Alter
Who, BB?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
...I guess I see it.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
If she really does have Pele the volcano goddess installed as one of her subfunctions, that'd make her actually kinda badass.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
From what I know about Pele, she was a goddess of fire who came to Hawaii from the land of the gods.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Her sister, the goddess of water, ended up killing her, but even that wouldn't keep her down.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]
＠Jeanne Alter
She went on to rule Hawaii's volcanoes with her mind alone. From then on, no one could touch her.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
She has lots of love to give, but she also takes it away. She's a goddess of civilization who granted fire to the people, and she's also a goddess of destruction who took that same civilization away.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
And just like Hawaii's volcanoes are still active,[sr]Pele still lives on in Kilauea.
[k]
