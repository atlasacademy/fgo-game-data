...Ahem.

Forgive me.[sr]I know you are busy, my lord...

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
...But I would like you to accompany me somewhere.

Ah, the crows caw...

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Even when I think I've gotten used to it,[sr]it still strikes me as strange somehow...
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
What a finely crafted trick, this Simulator. Interesting, to think that I am merely standing in an illusion.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
But if I were to criticize, its scents are pale imitations. The smells of the wind, grass, trees[line 2]and especially the dirt[line 2]do not seem to have any life to them.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
On top of that...

How unimaginable...that I, Yagyu Tajima,[sr]would frolic about merrily at my age.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Even though I should be used to this manifestation as a shadow by now, I've been chattering about trivialities.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Heh. Fortunately, Shichirou is not[sr]here to see me behave this way.

One of the ten Yagyu sights: Momoji Bridge.

It is the bridge at the foot of Reigenzaka, the hill that leads to Houtokuzen-ji, the Yagyu family temple that was built by the monk Takuan.

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
...I'm glad you think so.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
It was worth asking Lord Da Vinci and Lord Holmes[sr]to pour some resources into the simulator.
[k]

？！

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
This bridge is one of my favorite places. It looks splendid at sunset, especially alongside autumn foliage.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Obviously, this is a fake. An illusionary[sr]product of the simulator.[charaFace A 0] However...
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
To me, the shadow of Yagyu Tajima, one could[sr]say that this is the true Momiji Bridge.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Perhaps not.[charaFace A 1][sr]Heh. Excuse my jest.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-kami
Hahaha. Ah...hahaha...
