We need to eat lots of good food now so we'll have the strength to face the challenges ahead.

We certainly can't live off protein bars and energy drinks, like that weird bat girl. That's the kind of idiocy that would get us killed.

Heh. When you reach my level of excellence, you are able to write your own ticket, so to speak. Any number of establishments will seek your skills.

In addition to waiting tables, I am also a master chef and a fastidious cleaner. Suffice to say, there is much more to me than my penchant for popsicles.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
Now, what will it be? If nourishment is what you need, I recommend the Hawaiian Burger Combo Meal.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
The burger is too well prepared to offer much sustenance, but the mountain of fries that comes with it is cooked in delicious oil, and will ensure you leave with full bellies.

Why did you give her that extra money just now?[sr]Was it a bribe for her to spare our lives...?
[k]

＠Nitocris
No, no, it was her tip. I know they don't do this where we come from, but in Western countries like the United States, it's customary to pay waiters a percent of your bill as a tip. Required, even.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠C：[servantName 503000:Caster of Storytelling:Scheherazade]
I see... I had no idea...
[k]

＠Nitocris
I was surprised when I first learned about it too.
[k]

＠Nitocris
But after thinking it over, I realized it was no different from offering a word of praise to the servants who would fan me all day on top of paying their salaries.
[k]

＠Nitocris
In that sense, it's an excellent opportunity to show off the generosity of the pharaohs!
[k]

[charaFace C 3]

＠C：[servantName 503000:Caster of Storytelling:Scheherazade]
I see... So, how much are you required to give them?
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Nitocris
How much money, you mean? It depends.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠C：[servantName 503000:Caster of Storytelling:Scheherazade]
...!
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Nitocris
I heard that it tends to be around ten to twenty percent of the total bill.
[k]

＠Nitocris
Oh, but in fancy restaurants like this one, it's more common to tip twenty to twenty-five percent, so that's what I did just now.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠C：[servantName 503000:Caster of Storytelling:Scheherazade]
Y-you're kidding... Then, there's no telling how much money you might be required to spend!?
[k]

＠C：[servantName 503000:Caster of Storytelling:Scheherazade]
That's horrifying.[sr]I could wind up dead...well, financially!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Nitocris
...
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Nitocris
I didn't say anything when we left our room because I thought you already knew, but...you're actually supposed to tip housekeeping too.
[k]

＠Nitocris
That's why I left that bill on top of the bed.
[k]

＠C：[servantName 503000:Caster of Storytelling:Scheherazade]
N-now that you mention it, you did, didn't you! I just thought that was some sort of ritual peculiar to the pharaohs...
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠C：[servantName 503000:Caster of Storytelling:Scheherazade]
Incidentally, what would happen if one forgot to tip?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Nitocris
Well, it's very rude not to, so I imagine[sr]housekeeping would be fairly upset.
