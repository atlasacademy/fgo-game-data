“Today at 2:00 p.m., come to My Room alone. Be careful of your surroundings, and take care not to be followed.”

？1：...That was the message I got from Alter, Fou.
？2：Guess I'd better brace myself...

Oh, Cath[line 2]I mean Fou. You're here too, eh? What are you, [&his:her] bodyguard? Impudent little thing, aren't you!
[k]

[charaFace B 11]

＠Altria Alter
Hm. I told [&him:her] to come alone, Fou, but I suppose it is all right if it is only you. You are hardly a complete stranger to me, anyway.
[k]

[charaFace B 10]

＠Altria Alter
Now then, [%1].[sr]Did you read my message?
[k]

＠Altria Alter
I'm sure you already know why you're here.[sr]But...well, you know...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Altria Alter
As you can see, I'm taking a break from my maid duties today. I have no concern for either status or hierarchy at the moment.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
Take this.[sr]This is your requiem.

...Oh, uh, I wasn't talking to you, [%1]. I meant that beast.

[charaFace B 7]

＠Altria Alter
Honestly...why would you think I am a hit man?[sr]They're obviously made of chocolate.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Altria Alter
No matter. My business with you is concluded. Take them back to your room and have them as a midnight snack or something.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Altria Alter
They're not particularly sweet, but hey, you get six. That should keep you satisfied. If that is insufficient, then go get some more chocolate from the other Servants.
[k]

？1：It's okay. I don't need six.
？2：The first shot already got to me.

＠Altria Alter
...Anyway, allow me to reiterate. The chocolates are sweet enough for you, now, aren't they?
[k]

＠Altria Alter
Enjoy them, then.[sr]This is a gift you will have but once a year.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
So, just one shot was enough, eh? Heh. There's nothing that makes this maid happier than hearing that.
