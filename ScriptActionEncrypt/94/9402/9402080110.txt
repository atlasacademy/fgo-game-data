Hey, Master.[sr]We're done planting the trees.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
All that's left is to see how they actually grow.[sr]'Course only this empress lady would know about that.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Cú Chulainn
Really, though...why did we even get called over here to do this?
[k]

？1：Uh... Well...
？2：I thought you were right for the job...
？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠Cú Chulainn
I'm not complaining or anything.[sr]I'm actually surprised how easy this was.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
...I'm sure these guys feel the same.

I concur. Though I am a warrior, I did not find working with the dirt to be especially difficult.

After all, the proper placement of a stake requires it to be thrust into the earth. This merely requires a different perspective than my norm.

Farmwork is like a battle against oneself.[sr]This is good, honest work.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
Admittedly it's a bit unsettling to think that this is all for chocolate and the evil ritual of Valentine's...but that's another matter.
[k]

＠Diarmuid
Cacao trees are not tainted by sin.[sr]They have nothing to do with charming others.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Diarmuid
Were I to make a wish, it would be that these cacao beans are put to peaceful uses.

Sheesh, what the hell is that empress think[line 2]

Why the long face, young warrior? You look like[sr]you're very worried about things yet to come.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
Well, I don't blame you. Women get so wound[sr]up this time of year. It's such a pain.
[k]

＠Cú Chulainn
I mean, I don't give a rat's ass about chocolate or these traditions, but if getting a box of it'll settle things, I'd rather deal with it than with them.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Cú Chulainn
And really, if it wasn't chocolates, I'd be REALLY worried about what the replacement might be.[sr]I doubt I'd even be able to sleep.

Yeah, especially with Medb[line 2]

Well then, I suppose I'll have to start from scratch in my strategy for Operation: Get My Cú.
[k]

＠Medb
Maybe I should change it up by smacking him in the face with my chocolates so he'll physically get the message!
