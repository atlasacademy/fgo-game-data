＠Jeanne
Good evening, Master.[sr]Lovely weather tonight, isn't it?
[k]

？1：Still wearing your swimsuit, huh?

＠Jeanne
Of course. That way, I can go[sr]swimming whenever I feel like it.
[k]

？2：Are you taking a break too, Jeanne?

＠Jeanne
Yes, I am. I'm just on my way to the beach now.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Jeanne
Would you care to join me, Master?

＠Jeanne
I must say, Master, you certainly have your work cut out for you every year. First there was that desert island, then a race, and now, ServantFes.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Jeanne
And since it's summer, lots of Servants[sr]tend to get a little...out of hand.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Jeanne
Does it just not occur to them to try[sr]and conduct themselves more modestly?
[k]

？1：You sound like a head prefect...

[charaFace A 11]

＠Jeanne
Hehe, a head prefect, huh. As my Ruler self,[sr]that might well be what I most closely resemble.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Jeanne
But right now, I'm an Archer, and I have[sr]just a little more freedom than usual!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Jeanne
...Yes, just a little!
[k]

？2：You sound like a mother...

[charaFace A 2]

＠Jeanne
I believe you mean “big sister,” right?[sr]Riiight?
[k]

＠Jeanne
I'm still too young to[line 2]I mean,[sr]it's too soon for me to be a parental figure...
[k]

＠Jeanne
So I'm perfectly happy sticking[sr]with my big sister position!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Jeanne
That said, I'm still in perfectly[sr]high spirits myself.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Jeanne
I can tell this place has had[sr]a relaxing effect on you too, Master.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Jeanne
Sure, it looks like there's something more going on behind the scenes, but never mind that now.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Jeanne
We're in Luluhawa![sr]Relaxing is the order of the day!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Jeanne
Please, don't think of me as your Servant here.[sr]Let's see...
[k]

＠Jeanne
How about you think of me as your big sister?
[k]

＠Jeanne
That way, once it's time to get[sr]back to restoring humanity...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Jeanne
...you can still count on me for any help you need.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Jeanne
Once you see what a good big sister I am, thanks to all the practice I've had with Alter and Alter Lily...
[k]

＠Jeanne
...you'll be saying, “You're the best[sr]big sister ever!” before you know it!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Jeanne
All right, let's start by holding hands.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Every good big sister holds[sr]hands with her little [&brother:sister]!
[k]

＠Jeanne
[f large]Now let's go!
[k]

？1：So I guess I have a big sister now.

[charaFace A 12]

＠Jeanne
And a super reliable one at that!
[k]

？2：Sister?

[charaFace A 10]

＠Jeanne
No, that doesn't sound quite right.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Jeanne
You really must call me “Sis,”[sr]or I'll simply ignore you!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 8]

＠Jeanne
...What's that? I'm the one who's[sr]still acting a bit too formally?
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Jeanne
H-hmm. You may be right.
[k]

＠Jeanne
I guess I need to learn how to be more casual[sr]if I'm going to be a good big sister...
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Jeanne
Ahhh...[sr]Ahem, ahem.
[k]

＠Jeanne
Wh-what's up, [&buddy:sweetie]?
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Jeanne
...[sr]...I must say, that was a rather novel experience...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Jeanne
You know, while we're at it, why don't we[sr]invite Alter and Alter Lily to join us?
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Jeanne
We'll be one big happy family![sr][&Three sisters, one brother:Four sisters, all together]!

Listen, Master...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Jeanne Alter
When it comes to this kinda weird, creepy bullshit,[sr]you just gotta learn to be firm and say no.

Hmm. I suppose we have no choice left but[sr]to persuade them a little more forcefully.
