Ugh, that fan of hers kicks up a literal storm![sr]What a pain in the ass!

＠Medb
Braves, we're leaving! There's no point holding a photo shoot if she's going to rain on my parade!

Roger that! I'd suggest switching over to a wet T-shirt shoot in that case, but I suppose we would need special equipment for that!

All right guys, you heard Her Majesty! Remember, we're still on for the deep-sea dive shoot this afternoon!

Welp, this has been "fun" and all, but I'm afraid[sr]I'm too busy to play with you dweebs anymore.

＠Medb
Good luck with your little book project! You're gonna need it, since there's absolutely no chance a club of newbies like you could ever make anything good!

Anyway, I'd better get going. I don't want to keep Marie waiting for our lunch date.

＠Jeanne
You've all got a club too, right?[sr]Then I'm sure I'll see you again at ServantFes!

Sheesh... So we just ran into the reps for[sr]two major clubs purely by accident, huh.

Between Jeanne's production talent and Medb's unorthodox approach, we've got our work cut out for us...
