There is another reason you[sr]made this tower, isn't there?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Hmm?
[k]

＠General Setsubun
If all you truly wanted was to ask me whether I was an oni or not, you would never have made it so tall. That is much too complex an endeavor for such a simple goal.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
It may make sense in the abstract, but I cannot[sr]believe you ever pursued it in earnest.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
So of course I would expect that your true intentions lay elsewhere.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Shuten-Douji
Ahaha...[sr]You're thinking waaay too hard about this.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I'm just an oni who loves her drink. You can't expect me to go around taking everything seriously, sweetie.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
But if you reeeally insist, I guess I might have thought it'd be fun to do something big for Setsubun.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I really WAS trying to get you to admit to your true oni nature by making this tower, and having a bit of fun while I was at it...
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
...but it wouldn't have been much fun if[sr]you were the only one making your way up.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
So I thought, if we make a big Setsubun festival[sr]out of it, we could ALL have more fun.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
I see. Does that have anything to do with[sr]the man you prevented from climbing?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Shuten-Douji
...Oooh, you're a lot sharper than you look.

＠General Setsubun
I AM a general, after all. It is part of my job[sr]to keep a close eye on everyone's condition.

[charaFace A 3]

＠Shuten-Douji
This time around...if me and the brat faced off, we'd only end up killing each other. That's just how it is.

＠Shuten-Douji
I mean, that's fun in its own right, but I'm having so much more fun being Master's Servant right now.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
So keeping him on the ground was basically me[sr]saying “We don't have to do this NOW, okay?”

She stretched out dejectedly, and got to her feet.

It was then that I had a thought.[sr]A wild, baseless, unfounded thought...

I wondered if perhaps her true objective in building this tower...

Up on that roof, she wouldn't have to worry about anyone else interrupting us, or overhearing what we had to say.

A safe haven for an oni...and the one invited to join her.

Perhaps that was what she truly needed. A place where she could be herself...and someone who would join her there.

No matter how I squinted my eyes,[sr]I could never look directly upon its light.

All I could do was let loose my arrow, taking with it my love for him, knowing with certainty that my beloved lay in the direction it flew.

I was, in essence, dreaming.

I dreamed of the long life I once lived, solitary and alone. Of dying together on the battlefield, a fate that never came to pass.

And, of parting ways with the battlefield,[sr]and living a long, long life, happy together.

Indeed, even if I were to lay my hands on the omnipotent wish granter known as a Holy Grail, and could receive anything I asked for...

Up to that very moment, I had wished fervently for nothing more than for my beloved to rest in peace.

That much was certain.

I had wished as greedily as an oni,[sr]and as modestly as a human.

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Hm?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Well now. I thought it'd be a fun change of pace to try drinking in the rec room, but look who's already here.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
It's nice to see you two getting along so well.
[k]

？1：Heya.

I've been waiting all this time for you to come and pay your respects, and now you invite me to[line 2]
[k]

＠Gaming Archer
I only resort to violence when there is no alternative. ...Here, consider this an advance.

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Hmm, this is azuki bean daifuku.[sr]It tastes just as sweet as I remember... (Munch, munch)
[k]

＠Gaming Archer
As I told you, I could use all the help I can get.[sr]Now please, come here and take this controller.
[k]

＠Gaming Archer
I am currently engaged in a three-on-three[sr]team battle against Lady Osakabehime.
[k]

＠Gaming Archer
I let the CPU fill in for our missing team member, but I see now that the more allies I have to whom I can give orders freely, the greater my chances of victory.
[k]

＠Gaming Archer
It is fortunate that Master happened to show up when [&he:she] did, but I could still use another player...
[k]

[charaFace D 2]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
(Munch, munch) And why should I help you with that!?[sr]Hand-eye coordination isn't really my strong suit!
[k]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
An oni does not concern herself with her allies' placement in battle! Why else do you think I fought on Mt. Ooe all by myself!?
[k]

＠Gaming Archer
Ibaraki... (I cannot believe how much consideration she shows to those around her...)
[k]

＠Gaming Archer
That is too bad. I was planning to repay your[sr]kindness with more azuki bean daifuku, but[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace D 1]


＠Ibaraki-Douji
Mwahahaha, [se ad215][charaMoveReturn D -128,0 0.4]give me that controller! I will show you[sr]what an expert co-op match looks like! Just watching you play a bit is all it took for me to master this paltry game!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Soon I shall hear the wailing and lamentations[sr]of that bat woman as she cowers in abject defeat!

I swear, Ibaraki's sweet tooth will be her downfall... Oh well, guess it's better than getting kicked out, since we ARE oni and all.
[k]

？1：Like that Setsubun saying “Out with oni, in with good fortune”?
？2：You know, in some places, people say “In with oni” too.
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
Hehehe, is that so? I can hardly imagine what sort of nutjobs would want to invite oni into their homes.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
Oh well, I suppose I'll just cheer[sr]you all on from back here.
[k]

？1：Want to trade with me?
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Shuten-Douji
No thanks, sweetie. I can't drink if I'm holding a controller with both hands, now can I?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I'll just watch you all so my drink goes down easier. Make sure you put on a good show for me, 'kay, sweetie?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Cause if you don't, and I get bored, I might just start nibbling YOU, starting with your ears...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
Fufufu. Good luck out there, 'kay?
[k]


＠Shuten-Douji
If you're gonna invite this many oni into your home, you better be ready to handle us aaall the way to the end.
