Mwahahahaha, this was fairly entertaining.[sr]Farewell!

I went real hog wild this time around. I'll never forget the look on those couples' faces after I turned into a shark and drove them all apart!

Hmph, I'll never understand how these oni end up so twisted. Still, in the end, she is merely a lion with the mind of a house cat.

I mean that while she may present herself as a lion, she still possesses the heart of a tame house cat.

Forget it. [%1], I presume[sr]you are here to ask me about BB?

Strangely enough, it seems I bear some innate resistance to repeating worlds of this sort.

[charaFace C 4]
＠Count of Monte Cristo
...Then again, it could be a skill that[sr]belongs to my class, rather than myself.
[k]

＠Count of Monte Cristo
Perhaps those who came before me experienced world-ending cataclysms of an endlessly repeating nature...

[charaFace C 0]
＠Count of Monte Cristo
But I digress. As a matter of fact,[sr]there is something I wish to ask you as well.

＠Count of Monte Cristo
What is BB's goal?[sr]If anyone here would know, it's you.

？1：Well...

I have not yet gotten that far.[sr]But, with all of you here, perhaps that can change.

My guess is that BB is the one[sr]who sent Ibaraki-Douji after me.
[k]

＠Count of Monte Cristo
...Robin Hood, I would request[sr]that you lend me your cloak.

That's right. You and BB are particularly ill-suited for one another...or is it well-suited?

Ill! Definitely ill!

[charaTalk C]
[charaFace C 0]
＠Count of Monte Cristo
Regardless, using the No Face May King would put[sr]you at considerable risk of being found out.
[k]

＠Count of Monte Cristo
Not through any fault of your own,[sr]but merely due to a twist of fate.

Oh, yeah... I think I know what you mean.

In fact, I think BB's already got me[sr]pegged whenever I go out on my own...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
...and that will only get worse if I try to track her.
[k]


[charaTalk C]
＠Count of Monte Cristo
That is why I can use it to follow where BB goes.

In the meantime, I shall handle Luluhawa's[sr]encroaching darkness alone, during the night...
