Okay, I'm calling it now!

Alter, Ushiwaka, Mash, [%1].
[k]

＠Robin Hood
ServantFes begins in six hours, and we still have over half the book left to complete.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
This is as far as we go. I get how you all feel, but since I'm the manager here, I gotta give it to you straight.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
We need to give up on the idea that we're going to finish this book in time to send it to the printer, and settle for photocopies of what we have right now.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Personally, I think that's the best we can do at this point in time. Any objections?

Ow, ow, ow. I'm happy with how the inks turned out,[sr]but I think my blisters are getting blisters...
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Yes, I guess you're right. There's just no way[sr]for us to finish the last eighteen pages in time.

...I'm afraid not. No matter how I look at it,[sr]I don't see any way we could finish by morning...
[k]

＠Mash
I'm so sorry, everyone.[sr]If only I'd been a better assistant...
[k]

？1：Are you okay with this, Alter?

Eh, whatever. Photocopies are fine.[sr]Just did this for fun, anyway.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Jeanne Alter
...I mean, it sucks that we couldn't finish, but at least this'll be better than sending an unfinished draft to the printer.
[k]

[charaFace B 13]

＠Jeanne Alter
What about you, Robin?[sr]Aren't you worried about turning into a pig?

＠Robin Hood
Nope. BB said we need to “make” a book,[sr]and the way I see it, photocopies count just fine.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Robin Hood
Besides, we all did our best to draw it, so there's no way it's gonna turn out badly, photocopy or not.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Robin Hood
Considering this was our first time doing anything like this, I'd say we more than made the grade. Great work.
[k]

？1：Robin... Thank you...
？2：Pig or not, you'll always be Robin to me...

Now, now. Even if we are switching to photocopies, there's still a lot of work to be done.
[k]

＠Mash
We need to finalize a design for the finished part, find a place with a photocopier...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
...fold the copies into a book,[sr]and staple them all by hand.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
It's going to take us at least[sr]three hours to get through it all.
[k]

＠Mash
So let's get started now, or we won't[sr]get any sleep at all before ServantFes.

Well, we can't have that. I know I would much rather rest and relax in the morning. All right then, we shall make one last push until daybreak.

Guess that's settled then. How about you, [%1]?[sr]You gonna stay up with us, or get some shut-eye?
[k]

？1：You better believe I'll be sticking around to the end.
？2：Hey, I'm part of this club too.

？！

[charaFace B 6]

＠Jeanne Alter
Damn right. That's what I wanted to hear.[sr]Right then, can you take care of this last page?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Just add something that lets the reader know the rest of the story will show up in part two. You know, “To be continued” or whatever.
[k]

？1：Ooh, I've got one.

？！

[charaFace B 8]

＠Jeanne Alter
Wh-what!? No, not that! That just makes it sound like it's been canceled or something and there won't be a part two at all!
