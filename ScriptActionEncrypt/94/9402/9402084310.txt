Tee hee...
[k]

＠Helena
Listen up, Master. This year, I'm fully prepared.
[k]

＠Helena
I never really put much thought into it before, but I now realize that children in modern society should receive modern gifts.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Helena
Which got me thinking...[sr]What sort of things do today's children like?

＠Helena
It's not like I went to great lengths to find out or anything. No data collection, no research. Nothing. Something just struck me as appropriate.
[k]

＠Helena
I'm sure you'll like it. Mash too, in fact.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Helena
...Then again, I suppose I shouldn't exaggerate, either. It'll get your hopes up.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Helena
Still, I'm serious.[sr]This is exactly the sort of thing today's youth loves.
[k]

＠Helena
It hit me...like it was instinctual![sr]And it's different than the voice of Mahatma, so[line 2]

＠Helena
Wait, no, no. Being pretentious never did anyone any favors. All right, here it is![charaFace A 1]Happy Valentine's Day!

＠Helena
Hee hee. What do you think? Modern, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Helena
I asked Da Vinci to show me various archived data,[sr]and spent half a day looking through it.
[k]

＠Helena
What I found were these cute chocolates with caricaturized images of various characters.
[k]

＠Helena
And because this gift is for you, I made the chocolates look like cute little versions of certain Servants here in Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Helena
Tee hee...what do you think? Modern, right?[sr]Modern kids would LOVE this, right!?
[k]

？1：Th...thank...you!

＠Helena
Oh no, no! Not a problem!
[k]


[branch select03_end]

？2：Let's just put aside the question of whether[csr]modern kids like it or not...but thanks!

＠Helena
Hm?

＠Helena
Did I make a mistake? Don't tell me. It's not modern at all... It's even a generation or two behind!?
[k]

＠Helena
R-really!? Eh... B-but it...it struck me as appropriate![sr]I thought THAT was the way to go...
[k]

＠Helena
...
[k]

＠Helena
...Is it really that bad?
[k]


[branch select04]

？！

[label select04]

？1：Not at all.
？2：I'm really happy. Thank you!

[charaFace A 1]

＠Helena
