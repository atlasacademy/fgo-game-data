That's why we shouldn't limit ourselves[sr]to just the doujin from here on.

We need to spread out, find other Servants,[sr]and hear what they've got to say, too.

＠Jeanne Alter
It's rough, but if BB was telling the truth, and we're gonna keep looping until we take first place...
[k]

？1：We'll just have to keep at it until we get it right?
？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
Pretty much, yeah.

I'm afraid you're gonna end up being real busy too.[sr]Better steel yourself for that.
