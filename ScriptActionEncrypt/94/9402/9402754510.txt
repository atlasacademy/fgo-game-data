Oh, that. It took way longer than I thought to get enough reference materials and draw the guns.

That's why we had to give up by the end and fill out the remaining pages with the 3D schematics we used as reference.

To tread far off the beaten path and blaze a new trail is the very essence of making doujin!

Anyway, I'd best be on my way.[sr]So much to see, so much to do!

I'm especially looking forward[sr]to the cosplay gathering later.
