＠Danzo
Did you call for me?
[k]

？1：I knew it...
？2：I had a feeling you would come.

？！

＠Danzo
Master. You are now the one I take orders from...my [&lord:lady]. Of course I shall always answer your call.
[k]

＠Danzo
And what business do you have with me today?
[k]

？1：It's not really business, but...
？2：[&You know, today's a day of chocolates...:I wanted to discuss my Valentine's Day plans...]

？！

＠Danzo
[&Chocolate, chocolate...:Valentine's Day, you say?]
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Danzo
Ah.
[k]

＠Danzo
Now that you mention it, the staff did mention something like that. Yes. I do also have some knowledge of it.
[k]

＠Danzo
I believe today is this so-called festival of Valentine's. I hear that one offers gifts to express their feelings for important people in their lives.

Even I...well, let's see... If only I had something to offer...
[k]

＠Danzo
...to those who take good care of me each and every day...
[k]

＠Danzo
Oh, that's right.[sr]How silly of me.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Danzo
...I-I'm terribly sorry![sr]This event completely slipped my mind!
[k]

＠Danzo
I do not have anything prepared...!
[k]

＠Danzo
How...how very foolish of me...
[k]

＠Danzo
As a puppet, I at least thought my short-term data storage system was not broken...but it really did slip my mind.
[k]

＠Danzo
...
[k]

＠Danzo
Perhaps I can offer...
[k]

＠Danzo
...Ascension materials...[sr]No, not something like that...

＠Danzo
Yes. It is a manjyu.[sr]This manjyu should suffice as a gift.
[k]

＠Danzo
This is a revised version of the Fuuma Manjyu.[sr]It is a product of superb quality from the Fuuma clan.
[k]

＠Danzo
I have made some additional improvements of my own as well.
[k]

＠Danzo
A single manjyu contains an entire day's worth of nutrients, and is said to give you the strength of a hundred men.
[k]

＠Danzo
In modern terms, it is high in protein, chock full of vitamins, and high in calories.
[k]

＠Danzo
Eating this manjyu will not only stave off starvation, but it will fill your whole body with energy.
[k]

＠Danzo
It would even be possible to increase your magical energy temporarily.
[k]

？1：Amazing!
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Danzo
Thank you.[sr]Yes, indeed. This is an amazing product.
[k]

＠Danzo
As one of the developers who worked on improving it,[sr]I am quite proud of it.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Danzo
But there's just one point of concern...

[charaFace A 2]

＠Danzo
[f large]It may taste terrible!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Danzo
You see, I do not have a sense of taste...
[k]

＠Danzo
The members of the Fuuma clan were very excited that the manjyu was revised. However, when it came to the flavor...
[k]

＠Danzo
Nobody dared to comment...
[k]

＠Danzo
Obviously, my work was focused wholly on its effects and performance, to the point that I failed to even consider its taste...
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Danzo
So that's why...um...
