This talk of a welcome party was merely a pretense for hiring all those guards, wasn't it?
[k]

＠General Setsubun
Your true goal was to drag me down the path[sr]of the oni as well, wasn't it, Shuten-Douji?

Aww, you finally make it here, and that's the first thing you have to say to me, sweetie? I guess patience isn't your strong suit, is it?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Look, even our young Master is at a loss for words.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
And drag you down? That's hardly how I'd put it.[sr]A little unfair really, don't you think?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
Wait, waaait. Has NO one said it? Really? All this time? Maybe they're just being polite, as teeerribly obvious as it is.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
Ah, well. If no one else will say it, I guess[sr]that means I have to. Sweetie, you're an oni.

[charaFace B 4]

＠General Setsubun
Did you somehow think that showing me all the Heroic Spirits forced to play Setsubun oni in this tower...
[k]

＠General Setsubun
...would convince me that oni were[sr]in actuality wonderful creatures?
[k]

？1：Yeah, that would never happen... I hope.
？！

[charaFace B 0]

＠General Setsubun
Master is right.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
The very notion is absurd. Preposterous.[sr]If this is some manner of jest, it is far from amusing.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
Your actions here might have endangered the whole world. And for what? Some misguided attempt to convince me that we are somehow alike?
[k]

＠General Setsubun
This has gone on long enough.

This abomination of a tower cannot be allowed to exist. Get rid of it at once, Shuten-Douji. Otherwise[line 2]

Oh, I almost forgot. You even use fire, right?

I can tell how strong you are just by looking at you.

There's an oni inside you. I can tell. Deep down, you're one of us, sweetie. That's all there is to it.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Shuten-Douji
...But even now, you refuse to admit it.[sr]You just won't accept who you really are.

And you know, if I'm being[sr]reeeally honest about it...

I remember the joy of being accepted for who I am.[sr]The joy of running into battle alongside powerful allies.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
I have not felt those joys in a long time, but...

＠General Setsubun
That right now, before anything else,[sr]I am Master's Servant.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
I could not be more fortunate to have a Master who accepts me as I am. I consider [&his:her] wishes to be my own.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
Whatever [&he:she] asks of me, I will happily oblige.[sr]Now, Master, what is your command?

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_4 1.5]

This will most likely be my last mission as General Setsubun. If I should be reduced to ash in its undertaking, then so be it!
[k]

＠General Setsubun
I shall use this newly rediscovered joy to stoke the fires of my loyalty, and bring them down upon your head!
