Is this not the site of the final battle?[sr]Has there been some kind of mistake!?

It is no mistake. I determined from the start that there would be two teams advancing to the finals.

Hahaha, I expected you would make your way here, mongrels! You have put on a most entertaining show!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
As your reward, I shall give you the opportunity to compete directly with your king. You will have a chance to bask in the honor as you fall to the ground.

So you mean to take us all on at once? If that is what your pride as a king demands, I have no objections.
[k]

＠Nero
But first... I know that my reserves alone could not possibly have sufficed to pay for this extravaganza.
[k]

＠Nero
So tell me, just how much did[sr]you spend to put on this event?

Heh. I would estimate it cost about three times what you had in Rome's treasury...but that isn't to say I had to spend much myself.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
One came up with a business deal to restore your treasury's funds. It succeeded brilliantly, so you now lay claim to several times what you did before.

It is no wonder he is known as one of the Nine Worthies. His powers of elocution are no less effective in modern show business than they were in his own time.

He must have been thinking harder about how[sr]to help Nero Fest succeed than you were.

Besides, it is not the proprietor that is the star of the show, but the brave heroes who take part in it! Now, as the undisputed strongest of them all, I shall reclaim the Holy Grail that is rightfully mine!

Foolish emperor. That is exactly why I will be fighting you in this form. The King of Heroes has been the star of this show from the beginning, and the star I will remain to the end.

Unfortunately for you, I have grown tired of counting my money and playing the kind, understanding king.

No, what I have in store for you is nothing less than hell itself! Your half-baked heroism will not be enough to defeat me!
