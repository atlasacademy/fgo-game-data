[font large]Convention staff, line up!
[k]


＠Leonidas
Listen up, all of you. You must not think of the attendees as ordinary people.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Think of them as living race cars who will burn every bit of fuel they possess in search of the books and merch that give them life!
[k]

＠Leonidas
However, race car or not, that does not give them carte blanche to zip around the convention center as they please.
[k]

＠Leonidas
Our duty here is to maintain order, to prevent people from panicking, and of course to allow them to roam the convention freely.
[k]


＠Leonidas
Thus, we swear here and now!
[k]

＠Leonidas
We shall ensure we provide Courtesy to attendees,[sr]and suffer neither Running, Accidents, nor Pushing!
