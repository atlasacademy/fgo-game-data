...I've been reading them for a while.[sr]They were helpful for learning to read and write.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
It was only recently that I started trying to understand how they work. There's both an art and a science to things like panel layout, writing dialogue, and so on.

So you used a reference then. Does that mean you didn't come up with this art style yourself?

＠Jeanne Alter
What? You got some kinda problem with imitation?

＠Ushiwakamaru
Not at all. Every learning endeavor begins with imitation. I have certainly learned my share of things via monkey see, monkey do.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Now that you have the fundamentals down,[sr]all you need to do is work on improving your art.

In fact, why don't you go with [&him:her], Mash?[sr]You put off eating out of deference to us, yeah?

But anyway, I didn't let that stop me from making some jelly do[line 2]I mean, rice balls and such.
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
I've got a bunch of different kinds, including spam! Ever had rice balls with spam before? Way better than you'd think.
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
Most of our carbs for the next three days are gonna come from bread, so it's nice to mix it up a little, you know?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]

＠Tamamo Cat
Why don't you take them down to the beach and have a nice, relaxing meal there? You might just find some new ideas out there!

Yes, it is.

Okay.

Here, have some mineral water, Senpai.

You're right, though.[sr]This place is like paradise.

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Yes. Very much so.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
Although, I also find the Luluhawan sea a little scary at night. It almost feels like the darkness and the water are blending together...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Oh, right. Shall we have our rice balls now, Senpai?

[charaFace A 13]

They look yummy.

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
I see...
[k]

＠Mash
It's a much more pervasive[sr]sourness than, say, a lemon.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
I've read that these picked plums are soothing to upset stomachs. It was very considerate of Cat to include them in these rice balls.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
All that aside...things certainly[sr]have gotten strange here.

＠Mash
Between the Singularity, ServantFes, forming a club, and making a doujin...not to mention that mysterious Foreigner...

Right now, we need to take care of these enemies. For some reason, they remind me of an author Servant whose night is day and day is night!
