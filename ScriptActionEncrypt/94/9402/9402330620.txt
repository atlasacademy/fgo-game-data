You know, like in a strategy game.
[k]

＠A：Xanthus
In games like that,[sr]it is very expensive to create powerful units.
[k]

＠A：Xanthus
First you have to work your way up the tech tree,[sr]and that takes a long time on its own.
[k]

＠A：Xanthus
And all this time, our opponent in this game,[sr]this Great Holy Grail War within the Greater Grail...
[k]

＠A：Xanthus
...has been laying the groundwork to produce the most powerful units possible.
[k]

＠A：Xanthus
No doubt whoever it is put in a lot of hard work.[sr]So, if this opponent is in the Hanging Gardens now...
[k]

＠A：Xanthus
...then of course, they'll be waiting for the right time to use their new units. This just occurred to me.

＠Sieg
And the Lancer of Black, Vlad III.

＠Sieg
Since we have other Servants on our side,[sr]we'll have to defeat them, no matter what.

[charaFace H 6]
＠Sieg
...It's possible these three are[sr]the ones seeking the Greater Grail.
[k]

？1：Even Karna...?
？！

＠Sieg
True, that would be very out of character,[sr]so it's probably not Karna.

[charaFace H 0]
＠Sieg
If there's anyone who wants the[sr]Greater Grail more than anything...
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Sieg
...it would have to be that other man.

Best they can do is some normal,[sr]orthodox planning, y'know?

[charaFace B 1]
＠Mordred
So I figured if we hit them with a reckless, batshit insane plan like mine, where one false step would get you killed, they'd HAVE to fall for it!
