All right, that's it, I'm done for today.[sr]We'll settle this in four days, at the Medb Contest!
[k]

＠Medb
And we'll do it fair and square!

＠Medb
What was that?

Look at you all well informed. That's right![sr]And when it comes, I'll mop the floor with you guys.

That's the spirit! Think positive!

[charaFace E 12]

＠Medb
Just what I like to hear!
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 13]

All right then, see you all around. I've got a lot of relaxing and other environmentally friendly endeavors to pursue, and not nearly enough time to do it.

If you've got time, I was hoping you could[sr]give me some art lessons. For my manga.

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Ah, don't worry 'bout that. Toto-sama here used to take hundreds o' pupils, and I used to tutor people to help with the bills.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Nothin' I can teach you can make you a good[sr]artist by itself. Still gotta put in the work.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
And above all, actin' all modest and stuff don't suit you. So go ahead and ask me what you really want!
