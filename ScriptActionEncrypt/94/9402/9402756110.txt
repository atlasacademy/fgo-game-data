And why is the long-haired professor the one suffering the brunt of the consequences?

So this spread in the last battle, it's exciting to read and all, but I don't understand why they're settling their differences as giant pro wrestlers in the Grand Canyon.

[charaFace H 1]

＠Ishtar
This is good! I didn't know Japanese storytelling favored stories of reincarnation!
[k]

[charaFace H 10]

＠Ishtar
But I don't get why you made this chick in the blue dress the main character. I mean, in the end, she just resolves things with brute force, right?
[k]

＠Ishtar
If you were going for a story about intelligence, mind games, and romance, you should've focused on this chick in the red dress.
[k]

[charaFace H 8]

＠Ishtar
In fact, you should change that right now, unless you want to feel the wrath of a divine curse.
[k]

？1：The point is to avoid messing up at the end, though...
？2：I mean brute force is...kinda what they both rely on...

？！

[charaFace H 13]

＠Ishtar
Well, that aside, I still like it.[sr]At least, this body seems to be really happy with it.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I guess this is what homesickness feels like. Once humanity is all back how it should be, I'll take you to visit my hometown as a reward.
