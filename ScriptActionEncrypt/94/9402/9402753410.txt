If I don't have enough, I'll have to take what I need from others. Every ServantFes exhibitor knows that.

But don't worry, I'm nothing if not fair.[sr]If I lose, I'll be willing to give up my space.

So yeah, they're scraps of paper. But they're not just any old scraps of paper. They're a storybook.

A story that's all about my love for them.

The only way they die is if I lose my special gleam,[sr]or if I'm disgraced in a spectacularly ugly fashion.

That's never going to happen, of course, but hey, you've got to have insurance juuust in case.

In which case, that's still no reason for[sr]Medb to try and steal another's space.
