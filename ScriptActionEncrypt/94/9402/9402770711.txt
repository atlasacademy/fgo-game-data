I'm surprised to see you out here on[sr]the beach by yourself, [%1].
[k]

？1：Well, you know...
？2：I just really needed a breather...

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Count of Monte Cristo
Heh. No need to justify yourself to me.

＠Count of Monte Cristo
You have your own battles to fight.[sr]Of course you need your rest.

＠Count of Monte Cristo
The nighttime waves offer no solace for me,[sr]but for you...that may not be the case.
[k]

？1：Do you not like the sea?

[charaFace A 0]

＠Count of Monte Cristo
Hmph. I don't care about the sea.
[k]

？2：(Look at the sea without saying anything)

Hm? ...Someone's there.

＠B：???
Well, well. I thought it might be nice to go for a moonlit stroll for a change, and who should I encounter but the two of you...

＠Scáthach
Your dress suggests otherwise.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Count of Monte Cristo
Let's just say that I got tired of hearing others constantly tell me I was in danger of losing my mind if I continued to wear black in the tropics.
[k]

＠Scáthach
I see. And you believe that outfit[sr]lets you blend in, do you?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Count of Monte Cristo
Perhaps.
[k]

＠Scáthach
I don't buy it. You are a Servant.[sr]You may have just decided to follow Master's lead.

Kuhaha... Interesting. By virtue of being a Servant, huh. I suppose that's one way to look at it.

Hmm, using your spirit form to flee? Well that's too bad. I was planning on putting you both through your paces.

？1：Uh[line 2]

＠Scáthach
Of course it does.
[k]

＠Scáthach
It must be fate that brought us together on this moonlit beach. What better way to spend it than with a little training!
[k]

＠Scáthach
You're working hard to finish a book in time for ServantFes, aren't you? Then you'll need all the stamina you can get.
[k]

＠Scáthach
Haha, don't worry, it's no trouble! I'll just have you run a few wind sprints, dodge a few beach balls...
[k]

＠Scáthach
...and finish up with a little spear dodging as well. I'll have you working up a good sweat in no time!
[k]

？1：Th-that's very kind of you, but[line 2]

＠Scáthach
I told you, it's no trouble![sr]I could do this all night! In fact, I think I will!
[k]

？2：Help me, Count of Monte Cristo!

＠Scáthach
Hahahaha. I told you, don't worry about it.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 2]

＠Scáthach
Now come on! We have all night,[sr]so let's make the most of it!
