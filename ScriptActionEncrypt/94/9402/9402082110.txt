＠Emiya Alter
Oh? Chocolates, you say?
[k]

？1：You don't like them?
？2：You don't like sweet things?
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Emiya Alter
It's fine. Nothing wrong with chocolates. You're starting to act more like a proper Master to me now.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
But you have given chocolates...to someone[sr]who no longer has a sense of taste.
[k]

？1：S-sorry!
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Emiya Alter
There's no need to apologize.[sr]Good intentions are like sandpaper.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
At first, whatever they are applied to is irritated,[sr]but in the end, everything gets smoothed out.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
If that makes the thing look good, then it all worked as it should have.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Emiya Alter
The purpose of a gift is the thought behind it.[sr]Taste, in this case, is not what matters.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Emiya Alter
But...now that you've put me on the spot, it wouldn't be appropriate for me not to reciprocate.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Hmm...

＠Emiya Alter
Yes. If you ever fall into an abyss, tie it around your waist.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
It's not that long, but I should probably[sr]be able to use it to pull you up.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Emiya Alter
I do not have anyone special that needs saving.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
That's why it only makes sense for my Master,[sr]who maintains my existence, to hold onto it.
[k]

？1：Um...thanks.

[charaFace A 0]

＠Emiya Alter
You're too kind, being grateful for such trash.
[k]

？2：It's a great present.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Emiya Alter
You think so? Either way, this leaves both of us, the one being pulled and the puller, with bloody hands.
[k]

？！

＠Emiya Alter
...I really can't taste anything.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
And it's not even a nutritious item for a Servant.[sr]Even rations are better than these.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
But...I must confess that today will be[sr]recorded as a special day in my diary.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Emiya Alter
Honestly, it's difficult for a man[sr]like me to admit to keeping a diary.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Though its only purpose is recording the day's activities, since even my yesterdays are so uncertain. Now then...
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
One day, when I read back through my diary and see the entry for this special day, I'll be sure to wince and laugh, Master.
[k]
