I think being on this island has helped her get a bit closer to who she used to be back when she was training on Mt. Kurama.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Benkei
...To the best of my knowledge, she didn't have many friends back then. At least, none who were human.

＠Benkei
The only reason she survived was her[sr]affinity for nature, animals, and tengu.

But later, when she was commanding[sr]us as a warrior for the Genji clan...

Well, she still had moments of lighthearted mischief, but she was first and foremost a cold, calculating general who strove for perfection in all of her actions and pursuits.
