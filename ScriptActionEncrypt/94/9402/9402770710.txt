＠Nightingale
I originally thought that making doujin was more[sr]of an idle pursuit, but it seems I was mistaken.
[k]

＠Nightingale
I have since learned it is an act of creation[sr]just as arduous as writing a book.
[k]

＠Nightingale
As such, I will not hesitate to take any and all measures I deem necessary in order to preserve[sr][%1]'s health.
[k]

＠Nightingale
Is that clear, everyone?
[k]

＠Nightingale
No staying up all night.

No staying up late, either.

Repeatedly staying up late leaves you drained.[sr]I won't have it.

＠Nightingale
If your schedule is so tight that it requires you to sacrifice crucial sleep, I would say that's a problem with the schedule, wouldn't you?
[k]

＠Nightingale
One must know what one can and cannot do, and work accordingly. To do that, one must begin by going to bed and waking up early.
[k]

？1：So making doujin is as arduous as writing a book, huh...

[charaFace A 0]

＠Nightingale
Yes, that is what I'm told.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Nightingale
I heard all about it from Andersen and Shakespeare, the two unhealthiest Servants in all of Chaldea, so I have no doubts regarding its accuracy.
[k]

＠Nightingale
And now, you're attempting[sr]to follow in their footsteps.
[k]

＠Nightingale
This, I cannot ignore.
[k]

？2：Did Andersen and Shakespeare tell you that?

[charaFace A 0]

＠Nightingale
They did.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Nightingale
Thanks to them, I managed to get wind of this situation before you all collapsed from exhaustion.
[k]

＠Nightingale
It was a close call to be sure...but now that I'm here, you can all rest easy.

Whatever it is, I won't have it. Modern sensibilities and this island may allow it, but I forbid it!

Health and life are all that matter.[sr]Public decency is secondary at best.

That isn't to say it doesn't have its place,[sr]but this? This is a matter of life and death!
