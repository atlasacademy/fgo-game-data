＠Inshun
Ah, what's going on, Master?[sr]It's a little early for dinnertime.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Inshun
Or have you come to take a nice nap and enjoy the fragrance of this bamboo grove?
[k]

＠Inshun
Then I believe I shall take a rest myself.
[k]

？1：It's snack time.
？2：Here you go.
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Inshun
Snack!? Sweets?
[k]

＠Inshun
Hm. I neither drink nor smoke, but I do like to indulge myself with sweet things.
[k]

＠Inshun
Then I shall happily accept!

Ahhh...I see. So this is what they call “chocolate.”
[k]

＠Inshun
And now for my first bite...

[f large]It's sweet!
[k]

＠Inshun
Nngh. Hnnnnngh![sr]Sweets of this time period are THIS sweet!?
[k]

＠Inshun
Unlike the complementary sweet and sourness of fruits, this is like an assault on the tongue!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Inshun
...Hm. But this is nice in itself![sr]There's a time for delicacy and a time for bluntness.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Inshun
But now, I'll have to give you something in return.[sr]A conventional gift would be boring, though...
[k]

＠Inshun
Okay. Taking your current situation into consideration,[sr]I will deliver a fitting gift!
[k]

＠Inshun
Master, head back for now, and wait a bit!

Hey there, thanks for waiting, Master![sr]It's a little early for supper, but are you hungry?
[k]

？1：I was just about to head to the cafeteria...

[charaFace A 1]

＠Inshun
Ah! Good timing!
[k]

？2：I've been stuffed from all the chocolates...

[charaFace A 1]

＠Inshun
Hahaha. Then my prediction was accurate.
[k]

？！

＠Inshun
First off, take a look at this!

＠Inshun
That's right. It's a Buddhist meal.
[k]

＠Inshun
Chocolate is a stimulating food.[sr]It probably sits in your stomach for a long time.
[k]

＠Inshun
Knowing that, I made a vegetarian dish that is gentle on your stomach and warms you up for the cold winter days.
[k]

？1：You did this, Inshun!?
？！

＠Inshun
Indeed. It may not be as good as what the cooks in a Buddhist temple made, but delicious food is nutrition for one's soul.
[k]

＠Inshun
In my past life, I made it a point to try to learn how to make anything.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Inshun
I'd like to be proud about that anyway, but it's been quite a while, so I'm a touch...rusty.
[k]

＠Inshun
Really, I've spent so much time on my spear skills that I never really did get particularly good at cooking!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Inshun
Anyway, as I am, I would be ashamed to cook for Master.
[k]

＠Inshun
So I asked for help from the Servants here who are masters of cooking, and I had them assist me in flavoring it.
[k]

＠Inshun
So other Servants took a taste of it first, but I can at least assure you that it is delicious!
[k]

？1：Thank you...!
？！

＠Inshun
Good, good![sr]Now, let's put our hands together and say...
[k]

？1：Thank you for the meal!
？！
