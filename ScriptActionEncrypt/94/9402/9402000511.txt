(Sigh) There are few things in the world more dull than background checks. All without an ounce of mystery.

[charaFace C 3]

＠Holmes
Nonetheless, as a now former guard, I will tell you just a bit about this tower before we part ways.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Holmes
In brief, this will not escalate into a major crisis.[sr]On that much, you have my word.
[k]

＠Holmes
You will find that the guards past this point[sr]are thinking things along the lines of...
[k]

＠Holmes
...“Hey, this is more like a vacation than guard duty.” Some more so than others, of course.
[k]

＠Holmes
That said, this tower is unlikely to disappear until someone makes the trek up to the top floor.
[k]

＠Holmes
So your task remains unchanged,[sr][&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].
[k]

＠Holmes
Continue climbing this tower at your own pace, and you WILL eventually reach the top. That is the name of the game, as it were.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Holmes
...Now, before we go our separate ways,[sr]would you mind if I asked you something?
[k]

＠Holmes
When Ms. Da Vinci told me to return, why did she point towards the window rather than the staircase?

？1：It's just a bungee jump cord!
？！

[charaFace D 2]

＠Da Vinci
Non non, it's a cutting-edge return kit with built-in automatic elevation adjustment!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Sure, it may bounce you a few times more than could be considered necessary[line 2]or safe[line 2]but hey, even a genius has to get her kicks somewhere!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Just watch out that you don't slam into the building when you bounce. It'd be a waste of good rope if it ended up snapping.

Heh. Very well then. No true gentleman would flinch at such a thing. Besides, this jump is nothing compared to the falls at Reichenba[line 2]

I'm not so stupid a writer that I'd actually go out in public. I'm well aware where I belong in society.

Besides, you kings only ever talk about the same thing, over and over! I swear, have none of you ever heard the word “clichéd” before!?

So don't worry about me. Just pretend I'm not here,[sr]and give me something I can work with!

You guys might be walking clichés, but at least you've refined those clichés to an art by now!

＠Kid Gil
I'm not sure even my grown-up self[sr]could change you or your principles.
[k]

＠Kid Gil
It'd be a dream come true if you and the great playwright ever collaborated on something. Since he loves himself as much as you hate yourself, I'm sure whatever you came up with would be[line 2]
[k]

＠Andersen
Are you always like this, or has the heat gotten to your head? You couldn't make me collaborate with him for all the gold pieces in the world.
[k]

＠Andersen
Just imagine what would happen if we tried writing a story with the same theme. The book would be split right down the spine.
[k]

＠Kid Gil
Right, sorry about that. I should have known you'd never go for something you really wanted. I admire your restraint.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]

＠Andersen
You really ARE an idiot! I couldn't possibly care less about collaborating with him!
[k]

＠Andersen
If we really did write two halves of the same book, we'd only end up arguing over who deserved the greatest share of royalties!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Kid Gil
Hmm, good point.[sr]That IS a major problem for authors, isn't it?
[k]

＠Kid Gil
You know, you seem to be in an even[sr]worse mood than usual, Mr. Andersen.
[k]

＠Kid Gil
Do you not care for hot springs?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Andersen
Hmph. I like lounging about naked after a bath just fine, but no, I don't find hot springs to be especially enjoyable.
[k]

＠Andersen
...To begin with, I'm not in the habit of taking my clothes off around others. But you'd never know it from all the fuss those fools make about how good hot springs are for the creative process!
[k]

＠Andersen
So let's get something straight. The idea that bathing in a hot spring will make your manuscript write itself is, at BEST, a myth.
[k]

＠Andersen
If you're going to push an author into a hot spring thinking he'll emerge with a manuscript, you might as well give a bunch of monkeys typewriters instead. You'll get the same results either way!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]

＠Andersen
Relaxation? Stress relief?[sr]Soothing aching writing hands and shoulders?
[k]

＠Andersen
Fools! Do you think we use nothing more than our arms and heads to write our manuscripts!?
[k]

＠Andersen
What's more, we are forced to sell our work at cut-rate prices! We've never been anything more than slaves to our pens and publishers!
[k]

＠Andersen
I can't even count how many times I've written something down only to wonder what I was thinking!
