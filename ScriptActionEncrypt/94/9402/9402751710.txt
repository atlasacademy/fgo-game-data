...Everything's getting jumbled up in my head, so I want to decompress. Come and join me at the beach.
[k]

？1：Sure.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Jeanne Alter
Can't you at least ay something polite,[sr]like “It would be my honor” or something?
[k]

？2：It would be my honor.

What do you think this is, one of Shakespeare's plays? Can't you just say “sure” like a normal person?

Yeah, I was! Got a problem!?

...I'm stuck on where to take the story from here.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
If we use the drafts we have now, I think the story will feel like it's dragging on a bit.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
But I'm worried that if I cut scenes to speed things up, later developments are gonna feel contrived.
[k]

？1：Could you cut some stuff from the first half?
？！

[charaFace A 8]
＠Jeanne Alter
N-no way! We need those scenes for world-building!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Jeanne Alter
...Then again, reading it over now, I'm more embarrassed than anything. I guess world-building isn't really that important...
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
The readers aren't gonna care how the world got the way it is, or what its god is like...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Jeanne Alter
What do you think? Do you think it feels tedious?[sr]Is it okay to linger on the details like this?
[k]

You don't see those every day.[sr]Let's go look for it!
