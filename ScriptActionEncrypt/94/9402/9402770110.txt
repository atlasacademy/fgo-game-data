＠Ushiwakamaru
[f large]Let's go swimming, Master!
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Drawing manga is all well and good, but we mustn't forget about the ocean right in front of us either.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I still can't believe how nice Luluhawa's beaches are. Not a single stone in the sand... Pleasantly warm water...
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Sure, you need to wear flip-flops when going near the reef, but it's still a paradise compared to other waters.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ushiwakamaru
By the way, Master, would you[sr]say you're a good swimmer?
[k]

？1：Good? Nah. Try great.

[charaFace A 0]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Oho. You've got guts, saying that in front[sr]of Ushiwakamaru, famed leaper of ships!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Ushiwakamaru
...Although, strictly speaking, I'm much better[sr]at running over water than swimming in it...
[k]

？2：I'm good at sinking like a brick.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Well then, this is your lucky day! I'll teach you everything I know from the ground[line 2]uh, water up!
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Swimming is an essential skill for any warrior!
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
I remember seeing many fall into the sea left and right, armor and all, during the Genpei War.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Ushiwakamaru
...Of course, in my case, I was so incredibly skillful that I never lost my footing, so there aren't any stories about my swimming exploits...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Ushiwakamaru
At any rate, the waves aren't too big today, so I think now would be a perfect time to go swimming.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
We could start by warming up in the shallows,[sr]then try swimming out towards the buoy.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Alternatively, we could also borrow some[sr]boards and try our hand at surfing.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ushiwakamaru
To tell the truth, I've been curious about surfing.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Think about it! For Lady Mordred to have[sr]gotten that hooked on it, it must be fun!

Oh, you're going surfing?[sr]Would you mind if I joined you?
[k]

＠Martha
I was trying to relax on the beach, but there were too many men who kept trying to talk to me.
[k]

＠Martha
So I was just thinking about[sr]going swimming to refresh myself.
[k]

？1：It's Martha...!
？2：Martha...!

＠Ushiwakamaru
We would welcome your instruction on enjoying the waves, as you are more experienced traveling on the sea than either of us!

“Traveling on the sea”? ...Oh, you mean Tarasque.[sr]Well, yes, I do ride on Tarasque's back...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Martha
...but as far as surfing goes, I'm as much of a beginner as you two. Why don't we all practice together?
[k]

？1：Come to think of it, you're both normally Riders, right?
？2：Come to think of it, you two are kinda similar, huh?

？！

＠Martha
Aww, that's sweet. I'm flattered to be[sr]compared to the legendary Ushiwakamaru.

I-I see. For my part, I feel like I'm a little out of my league, being compared to someone as wholesome as you...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Ushiwakamaru
But then, I suppose once we get in the water, we're both no more than another couple of Servants in swimsuits.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
All right then Master, Lady Martha,[sr]I'll go borrow some surfboards from the hotel.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Soon, I'll be leading the charge against Luluhawa's waves, or my name isn't Ushiwakamaru!

Oh... Sorry about that. I tend to laugh[sr]kind of loudly when I get too excited.

[charaFace A 1]

Anyway, now I know an altogether different way to handle waves. The ocean here really is fun!

On that note, Tamamo the dangerous summer fox[sr]maiden is here, and she brought beach balls!

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
You've all got energy to spare, right? Then why don't we put it to use and work up a good sweat before lunch?

How about a game of beach volleyball?[sr]It's a classic for a reason, after all.

？1：Sounds good.
？2：I'm fine with whatever as long as you're enjoying yourself, Ushiwakamaru.

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Ushiwakamaru
Then it's settled! For our second round, we'll play a game of beach volleyball! At last, never skipping leg day will pay off!
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
You must have done a lot of thigh workouts yourself, Lady Martha! Now's the time to put them to good use!
