That's right! It is that time of year once again![sr]I am proud to announce the fourth Nero Fest!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

Hehehe. Quite the jubilant reception, is it not,[sr][%1]? And who can blame them!
[k]

＠Nero
Of course it is! This is a festival of Rome, by Rome, and for Rome! Why shouldn't I be excited!?

[charaFace A 1]

＠Nero
I have prepared plenty of prizes once again, and would like nothing better than for everyone to test their strengths against one another in fierce competition!

[charaFace A 7]

＠Nero
Though it hardly need be said that I will be this year's victor! Yes, this is the year where all will sing my praises as Rome's greatest swordsman!

[charaFace A 8]

Of course! The mere fact that Olympia shall open its doors again is enough to content me!

Nero Fest is getting a bit long in the tooth, so I thought it would be a good time to present myself in all my steamy goddesslike glory!

Emperor Nero happened to find me fixing up the latest such Grail, and I agreed to let her have it at a fair price as long as she made it her grand prize☆
