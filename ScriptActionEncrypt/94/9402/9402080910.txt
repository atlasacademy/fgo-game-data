I am a model magical stick that LITERALLY protected my Master with my entire being. I'll just give myself a little praise here. I deserve that much...

I-I'm sorry. But I really didn't have a choice[sr]in that situation. I'm really sorry!

Soon after, Semiramis developed a special Mystic Code: a sword-shaped chocolate chunk that sparkled like a jewel.
[k]

＠
The Mystic Code had an unbelievable ability of gathering chocolates with just a sweep of the arm...
[k]

＠
This, of course, boosted chocolate production further still... However, nobody knew how the thing worked.

This nonsense with Semiramis and her[sr]Hanging Gardens is getting ridiculous!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Too many preposterous, impossible feats... Even for a Heroic Spirit or an ancient empress with extensive knowledge of magecraft! There's no way something like this would work!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Indeed, my research confirms what I expected all along...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's a Holy Grail.[sr]She's using a Holy Grail.
[k]

？1：I knew it...
？！

＠Da Vinci
We didn't realize it because the Grail was hidden deep in the Hanging Gardens, in the core that powers and operates the whole thing.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
See, the Hanging Gardens have both real and mystical components. Remember...? It's made from the soil and stone of her homeland...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...but at the same time it's pure Noble Phantasm.[sr]All of that combined makes it very hard to investigate.

So what is her intent?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Who knows? At this point, she says she's just out to make chocolates. Beyond that, I couldn't say.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
However, it's clear this is just going to keep escalating.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Bluntly, all this extra chocolate is going to start causing serious problems.
[k]

[charaFace G 15]
＠Mash
This sounds like a joke...
[k]

[charaFace F 4]
＠Da Vinci
But if we don't take them here, the chocolates are just going to pile up and likely be spread around the world...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...and that would be a real disaster.
[k]

？1：Is there a way to stop it?
？！

[charaFace F 0]
＠Da Vinci
Well, according to my calculations, there's simply no way we can destroy the Hanging Gardens to retrieve the Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It'd be like sending a small boat out to sea in the middle of a hurricane. That's how dangerous it is when a Holy Grail is functioning normally.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So I checked to see if we can do anything about Semiramis, who's controlling the whole thing.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But, bad news there, turns out that even if we stop Semiramis, we won't stop the Hanging Gardens.
[k]

？1：But it's a Noble Phantasm!
？！

＠Da Vinci
Even so. It has some sort of automated attribute, or there's something else going on. Either way, this is getting to be rather complicated.
[k]

[charaFace G 15]
＠Mash
S-so, what can we do?
[k]

＠Mash
Is there nothing we can do to stop the chocolate production without her help?
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 1.5]

＠Da Vinci
It's not that there isn't a way. We just need to change how we think. We need to make even more chocolate in a very short space of time.
[k]

[charaFace G 14]
＠Mash
!?
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_4 0.1]

＠Da Vinci
The Holy Grail may seem to supply boundless power,[sr]but it is not in any way everlasting.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And right now, it's supplying the Hanging Gardens with incredible amounts of power.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Space, mass, time, causality...all of those have been twisted for the purpose of producing chocolate.[sr]It's bound to reach its limit soon.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The best case would be to have it exhaust itself, but if the magical energy is circulating well, we can't count on that happening.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That's why, instead of maintaining its expected pace of chocolate production, we're going to make it work at a pace it doesn't expect.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In other words, we're going to destabilize the magical energy circulation. That way, even if only for a brief while, it will run out of magical energy.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It may just give us an instant, but that brief moment of stagnation will be our chance.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If the Holy Grail goes inert, we should be able to get to it. Then we can either take or destroy it.
[k]

？1：It's all or nothing.
？2：If that's our only option, then so be it.
？！

[charaFace G 7]
＠Mash
...Yes. If Master and the others have decided on it,[sr]then I have no objections.
[k]

＠Mash
It may be dangerous, but we shall[sr]increase production to reach overflow!
[k]

＠Mash
Please don't worry... I am confident that in our ability to weather this storm. I will make sure that Chaldea can ride out the chocolate apocalypse coming our way!
