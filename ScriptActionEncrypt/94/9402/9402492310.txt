What was the deal with all those weird Mini Nobus, anyway? Is it just me, or did they sound broken?

＠Avenger Yodo
...So, you've finally made it this far,[sr]evil servants of Tokugawa.
[k]

＠Avenger Yodo
I'm impressed you managed[sr]to defeat my Seven Spears...
[k]

？1：Can we just go now? It's dinnertime and I'm hungry.

[charaFace C 3]
＠Avenger Yodo
Really? Chacha wants curry! With a little flag in it![sr]Oh, and lots of honey and apples!
[k]

？2：Uh, I'm pretty sure none of us are with Tokugawa?

[charaFace C 7]
＠Avenger Yodo
Don't argue with Chacha's backstory!
[k]

＠Avenger Yodo
When you get right down to it, this whole Imperial Capital thing was Tokugawa's idea in the first place!
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 10]
＠Avenger Yodo
Hey! Don't try to change the subject!
[k]

＠Avenger Yodo
Chacha is no longer Chacha! Chacha is Avenger Yodo, the empress of Toyotomi who burns with fiery vengeance!

...Master, I know this situation seems like a joke that's gone too far, but she is seriously powerful! I think she may have reached a point where the Counter Force needs to get involved.
[k]

＠Okita Alter
...Then, wait... Does that mean that the[sr]whole reason I am here is for this moment!?
[k]

？1：Yeah, I reeeally don't think so.
？2：I think the Counter Force is better than that.

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Okita Alter
Yes, I suppose you're right. If that were the case,[sr]I'd have to disappear all over again.

Why does Cha[line 2]Avenger Yodo get the[sr]feeling you're not taking me seriously!?
[k]

＠Avenger Yodo
All right, that does it. Now that it's come to this, I'll show you just how powerful I've become.
[k]

＠Avenger Yodo
Taste the power I gained from the unyielding fury that turned me into an Avenger when I learned that you had finished the WHOLE event without me!
