Besides, when you're on my level, you can just gender-swap the characters in your mind, no probl[line 2]I mean, never mind.

I never would have thought there was another collector as fervent as Blackbeard. Is that...Arjuna?

Hmm, a battle between two brothers over which of them will inherit the throne... Fascinating.

Indeed, brothers in India are quick to fight one another. I don't see how it could be otherwise.

No, wait. It would be foolish[sr]to read the whole thing now.

I'll take one[line 2]no, five copies,[sr]in the hope that the archer wins.

And what's this? He used coconut trees as catapults to fire soldiers with iron shields at the castle? What a frighteningly effective tactic.
