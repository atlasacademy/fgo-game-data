＠Pirate A
Vacation spot or not, ye oughta know better'n ta come ta the bottom of a cliff like this all by yer lonesome.
[k]

＠Pirate A
Tell me, Master, do ye understan' how this happened?
[k]

？1：The ball Martha popped was blowing away...

？！

＠Pirate A
Go on.
[k]

？1：So I went to pick it up so it wouldn't just end up being trash on the beach. Then you showed up.

？！

[charaTalk off]

＠Pirates
Bahahahaha! Did ye hear that, boys!?[sr]Talk about no good deed goin' unpunished!

＠Pirate A
Maybe now ye'll think twice before ye go traipsin' around tryin' ta be a Good Samaritan.
[k]

＠Pirate A
Not that ye'll ever get a chance at that![sr]Right, boys!?
[k]

＠Pirate B
Right! I still remember what[sr]happened in Okeanos clear as day.
[k]

＠Pirate B
Sure, I mighta made a mistake[sr]signin' on with Blackbeard...
[k]

＠Pirate B
...but it was your Servants what threw me overboard.

＠Pirate C
An' ta add insult ta injury, yesterday...
[k]

＠Pirate C

＠Pirate A
Do ye get it now? We're all victims here!
[k]

＠Pirate A
Now, yer gonna pay us what we're due.
[k]

＠Pirate A
Let's see... How 'bout we start by having ye use up all those Command Spells of yers? Don't want no Servants showin' up here, after all...
[k]

＠Pirate B
Hehehe... Don't bother callin' fer help...

Indeed, he is. The handsome Frenchman[sr]has been most at home here in Luluhawa.

He was the first of the Round Table to strip off his armor and head straight for the ocean.

At any rate, I'm relieved to see[sr]you are unharmed, [%1].

I apologize if we overstepped our bounds in staging our little rescue, but we couldn't help but worry.

＠Gawain
Still, the last thing we would wish to do as[sr]Knights of the Round Table is to offend you.
[k]

＠Gawain
So you would be doing the four of us a great kindness if you could laugh this off as just a bunch of busybodies unable to stop themselves from butting in.

So I've been trying to avoid going[sr]out in public as much as possible...

But now that I'm here, I'm relieved to see you don't think anything of it. I guess this outfit wasn't as strange as I thought.

Oh! And hello, [%1]. I hope Sir Tristan[sr]wasn't being too much of a bother?
