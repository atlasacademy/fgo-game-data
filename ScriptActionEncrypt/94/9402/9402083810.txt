＠Nero
Umu, good of you to come, Master![sr]I know, I know...it's Valentine's Day.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Nero
This year's gift is going to knock your socks off![sr]Be both moved and amazed by my incredible talent!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Nero
Hm? My outfit grabs your attention more than the chocolate? Heh. I like the way you think!
[k]

＠Nero
I have long awaited this day, and so for the occasion,[sr]I have donned a summer dress, that I might be elegant, prim and proper, and Rome!
[k]

＠Nero
It's nice to let my hair down once in a while, isn't it?[sr]It's like being in my element because I'm on vacation.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Nero
But...umu. Today is not about me.[sr]I'll just take your praise and keep it in my heart for now.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Nero
Anyway...ahem! Now let me reveal this year's[sr]heart-stopping surprise chocolate!
[k]

＠Nero
I designed this miraculous confection, I collected its materials, and pulled out all the stops for the occasion!
[k]

＠Nero
Behold, the ultimate work of art...a colossus-grade chocolate...!

Umu! The statue that adorns my maritime theater Illustris, produced in an affordably priced, moderate size!
[k]

？2：A Venus de Milo...or rather, a Venus de Nero.

＠Nero
Exactly! When one thinks of the goddess of beauty,[sr]one imagines her scantily clad!
[k]

？！

＠Nero
Umu, umu. Should there be a time when an enemy strong enough to force me to use divine powers appears, I would like to dress like this.
[k]

＠Nero
I do not favor gods of war, nor omnipotent gods. I'd rather have the goddess of love or the goddess of beauty be my guardian.
[k]

＠Nero
That is the sentiment that I put into this chocolate when I designed it.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Nero
Well, I'm self-aware enough to know that this seashell bikini is a bit much...so I will not wear such a thing.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Nero
Either way...much as I know you may think it wasteful, don't hesitate to eat up.
[k]

＠Nero
I'm a bit embarrassed myself, but it is normal for the heart to race on Valentine's Day, yes?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Nero
Also, the chocolate is only a surface coating![sr]Beneath it is a golden statue!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Nero
It is delicious beyond words and a wonderful decorative piece! You will make such wonderful memories with it, just as we did during summer, Master!
