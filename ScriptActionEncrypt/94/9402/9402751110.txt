＠
I first learned about doujin when I came across a book that had been left in one of Chaldea's hallways.
[k]

＠
It was about a young girl who had been cursed by a witch, and a monster that hated the way he looked.
[k]

＠
They fell in love, had a falling-out, fought the witch together, and went on to get married.
[k]

＠
The girl's curse was never lifted, and the monster never turned into a handsome prince or anything.
[k]

＠
Even so, they loved each other, just as they were.
[k]

＠
It was only a thirty-page manga, but I must have read it at least a hundred times that night.
[k]

＠
It made me so angry I screamed.
[k]

＠
I'll admit it was good, but I just freakin' hate whoever drew the thing.
[k]

＠
I KNOW I can come up with a better story than this!
[k]

＠
...I didn't realize how stupid that was until I started trying to draw one myself.

That would be really inconvenient for me... See, I kind of forgot that I'd made a promise with Pele...

Yes, it is. Pele is still all but powerless now.[sr]She's practically a dead goddess walking.
[k]

＠BB
The only thing that can save her now is faith, and magical energy resources that want peace for Hawaii.
[k]

＠BB
So I came up with the idea to use the ServantFes[sr]attendees' passion to make a Holy Grail.
[k]

＠BB
From there, I just needed someone[sr]with a good heart to use it.
[k]

Someone who wouldn't make a selfish wish,[sr]but one that would bring peace back to Hawaii.

[charaFace C 14]
＠BB
But instead, you all got so caught up in sightseeing that you neglected your bookmaking duties.
[k]

＠BB
And because of that, Medb ended up winning ServantFes, and now I can't bring Pele back to life.
[k]

？1：Mm-hmm. How decent of you.

[charaFace C 1]
＠BB
What's that supposed to mean?[sr]When have I not been a decent and helpful kouhai?

＠BB
Yep! I mean, she's definitely got her share of problems, but she's still Hawaii's guardian deity.

At its core, a Holy Grail is really just a big ball of energy, so that should restore Hawaii's leyline.
