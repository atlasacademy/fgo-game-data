You know, I was quietly checking the restaurant out earlier, and I noticed something on their wall. It appeared to be a photo with a caption that said...

John, Jane, and Doe here are the only three of their kind. Their photo rights don't come cheap.

＠Blackbeard
It costs ten Gil Bucks per bird, per person, so three birds times five people comes to one hundred and fifty Gil Bucks.

Hey, don't blame me. I'm just “parroting” what my lawyer said! (Rim shot)
