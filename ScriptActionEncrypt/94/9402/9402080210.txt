＠Paracelsus
My apologies.[sr]It appears an explanation is necessary.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
Let me ask:[sr]What is chocolate production, really?
[k]

＠Paracelsus
It's the result of processing a fruit called cacao, which is transmuted into something else via heating and drying techniques and other human intervention.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
This changes its shape and aspect into[sr]something not possible in nature...
[k]

＠Paracelsus
It is, therefore, truly the work of man.
[k]

？1：In other words, chemistry.
？2：In other words, alchemy.
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Paracelsus
Exactly. You are very quick to understand.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Paracelsus
Therefore...unworthy though I may be,[sr]I have come to help.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
Different people working to produce chocolates using cacao beans will not always yield to the same results.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
The efficient refining of such materials takes skill.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
As such, my facility with alchemy[sr]may be of some use to you.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
What do you think, Master?

＠Paracelsus
It's quite simple.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
The amount of cacao beans produced will increase daily. There is, however, only one of me. If things continue as they are, I will not be able to manage matters by myself.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Paracelsus
So I have created more of me.

It is a special homunculus given a specific set of skills for a predetermined period of time. That would be the simplest way to think of it.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
It demonstrates extraordinary talent only in the task of producing chocolate using cacao beans.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
To use more modern parlance: this is like[sr]a robot designed for a specific task.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
Hmm... Yes, that might be more appropriate.[sr]Not a genuine homunculus, but a robot.

Obviously it is capable of acting autonomously.[sr]Remote operation would be another burden on me.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
But, again, it is expressly limited in its function.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
While it can be fully entrusted with the process of chocolate production, it will not take any other commands.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
By creating more of these, I can boost[sr]the efficiency of our chocolate output.
[k]

＠Paracelsus
...Master, I'm sorry to trouble you, but I'd like you to procure the materials necessary for that endeavor.

I have given it sufficient discretion to make any changes it determines would result in the more efficient production of chocolate.

So a modification of the production[sr]system may very well be possible.

I don't mean to be rude to Paracelsus,[sr]but I have a bad feeling about this...!
[k]

＠Mash
I'm not saying he's going to betray us or anything, but...
[k]

＠Mash
...there is a possibility that his good[sr]intentions may cause trouble in the long run...
[k]

？1：That's Paracelsus for you.
？2：We'll keep an eye on him. It'll be probably be fine... Yeah...
？！

＠Mash
Yes. Sorry to trouble you,[sr]but please watch him carefully!
