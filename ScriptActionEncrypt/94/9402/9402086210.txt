＠Semiramis
...Oh, don't be so alarmed, Master.[sr]I am still quite new as a Servant in Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Semiramis
And as such, I desire to know you better.[sr]Wouldn't that be a natural thing to wish for?
[k]

？1：I guess...
？2：It's true, but...!
？！

[charaFace A 2]

＠Semiramis
Forget about Chocoramis.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Semiramis
That stain on my good name has been completely expunged from my Spirit Origin.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Semiramis
Now, prepare yourself. I am about to bestow upon you a Valentine's Day chocolate.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Semiramis
But as am opportunity has presented itself,[sr]allow me to pose a riddle to you.
[k]

＠Semiramis
What manner of flavor do you envision for my chocolate?
[k]

？1：Um...it's hard to explain...
？2：A sort of numbing sensation...?
？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Semiramis
I see. Poison. You are correct.
[k]

＠Semiramis
What simple, natural logic.[sr]Of course I infused my chocolates with poison.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Semiramis
...However.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Semiramis
Have you forgotten?[sr]As I am the world's oldest poisoner...
[k]

＠Semiramis
I am also mistress of treachery.

＠Semiramis
Teehee. I have made it seem as if I slipped poison into my chocolates, or at least made them appear poisonous...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Semiramis
But, in actuality, this is no more or less than a proper, completely normal, beautiful assortment of chocolates.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]

＠Semiramis
Now then. Would I be so uncouth as to[sr]infuse poison in these masterpieces?
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Semiramis
Obviously not.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Semiramis
Hehe...even I think it turned out wonderfully.[sr]...Would you mind if I take one?
[k]

？1：Be my guest.

[charaFace A 5]

＠Semiramis
What a boorish response.[sr]Do not repeat that mistake.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Semiramis
No matter. I will take one...
[k]

？2：Say “ahhh.”

[charaFace A 12]

＠Semiramis
Heh. Is your plan to embarrass me,[sr]that you might escape trying them yourself?
[k]

＠Semiramis
Unfortunately for you,[sr]I am well accustomed to such sweet deception.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Semiramis
Come, place a chocolate in my mouth. Ahhh...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Semiramis
(Munch, munch)... Ah, delicious.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Semiramis
Even though I was the one who made it,[sr]the flavor itself holds no surprises.
[k]

＠Semiramis
It was neither supremely delicious,[sr]nor did it elevate me in delight.
[k]

＠Semiramis
No. In fact, it was quite plainly flavored.
[k]

？1：Oh, don't say that...
？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Semiramis
Oh, you think?[sr]Well, that is a relief.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Semiramis
Come, you should take a bite too.
[k]

？1：It's good...
？2：Feels tingly...
？！

[charaFace A 9]

＠Semiramis
Ah yes, that's the poison of a puffer fish.[sr]The scientific term is tetrodotoxin.
[k]

？1：!?!?!?
？！

[charaFace A 12]

＠Semiramis
Don't be so surprised.[sr]You have resistance to poison.
[k]

＠Semiramis
See, you don't feel breathless or anything, correct?
[k]

？1：But still...!
？2：It's puffer fish!
？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Semiramis
You should be able to endure exposure[sr]to far more potent toxins without dying.
[k]

＠Semiramis
But I have learned something of interest.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Semiramis
Your resistance doesn't completely nullify the poison, but rather it degrades it to the point where it makes you feel the effect of poison and flavor at their edge.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Semiramis
Had you nullified the poison, my chocolate would have been completely tasteless and odorless to you.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Semiramis
Nutrition can at times turn to poison.[sr]As can medicine.
[k]

＠Semiramis
Even flavor.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Semiramis
I have heard that, in bygone days, there were some who willfully ate puffer fish and met their ends, simply because the fish's toxin was so delicious.
[k]

＠Semiramis
But you need not worry.[sr]You and I can enjoy poison together.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Semiramis
Hehe...[sr]Good. Very good.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Semiramis
Now come, keep eating.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Semiramis
The next chocolate...contains amanita muscaria,[sr]the essence of a poisonous mushroom.
[k]

＠Semiramis
A normal human would be overcome with nausea and confusion...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Semiramis
But you are not a normal human.[sr]And so...
[k]

＠Semiramis
It is, after all, a once-in-a-lifetime flavor, you know.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Semiramis
Hehehe...once-in-a-lifetime indeed...
