And on top of that, this warm weather pretty much ensures that people dress lightly, which makes it real easy to tell if they're carrying a weapon.

The two families may have finalized their alliance by betrothing their children, but having the killer's identity remain a mystery is sure to create tensions.

If there's any consolation to be had, it's that our culprit won't be attempting anything sufficiently violent that it might easily be seen as foul play.

＠Professor M
...but for you, young Mash,[sr]I suppose an exception can be made.
[k]

＠Professor M
Holmes and I are both working with the same information this time, so all I needed to do in this case was fit those pieces of the puzzle together.
[k]

＠Professor M
We would naturally both arrive at the same conclusion, unless he were delirious with fever or the like.
[k]

[charaFace C 7]

＠Mash
Then, you know where Holmes went, Professor?
[k]

[charaFace C 12]

＠Mash
You both mentioned the full moon...[sr]He's not planning to GO there, is he?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Professor M
No, Mash, don't be silly.[charaFace C 3][sr]Though I imagine Holmes might find the notion amusing.
[k]

＠Professor M
I'll explain about the moon in due time. Unfortunately,[sr][%1] was only awake for a short while this time, so we were unable to warn [&him:her].
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Mash
...That's true. There was something[sr]I wanted Senpai to look into as well.
[k]

＠Professor M
Oh? And what might that be?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Mash
Well, nobody's come out and said it, but...

[charaFace D 0]

＠Professor M
Yes, that certainly seems likely.[sr]One could tell as much from her behavior.
[k]

＠Professor M
I imagine Aaron must have entrusted Chris to his[sr]mother after refusing to take him in himself.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Mash
...So then, Ann lost her son, too.

＠Mash
We have to solve this case quickly, before anyone else dies. Is there anything else, Professor?

There is indeed: Chris's dying message. Though there may not be much point in bringing it up now.
[k]

＠Professor M
At any rate, assuming this message was indeed meant to point to the killer, we cannot assume he would simply write the killer's name.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Professor M
A defining attribute of the killer would more than suffice. Personally, I believe he meant to write “mom.”
[k]

[charaFace C 12]

＠Mash
“Mom”? But how would that point to the culprit?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Professor M
It may not be a complete message, but it's also only three letters, making it much easier than writing out a full name.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Professor M
Though it's unfortunate Chris evidently failed to finish writing even that, giving the false impression that it was actually “mor.”
[k]

[charaFace C 8]

＠Mash
“Mom”... Wait a moment.[sr]If Chris was talking about his OWN mom...
