Besides, I've been sealed away so long that I am not exactly at my best. There is no reason for me to remain here anyway.

As a reward for cleaning this up, you may take the Holy Grail I used. You have just received a gift from an empress. Be grateful.

Well...um...

The moment I manifested here, I was given knowledge of Valentine's Day...and chocolate...
[k]

＠Semiramis
Bitter, yet sweet... It has the power to move one's heart... And at times, the power to damage a heart beyond repair...
[k]

＠Semiramis
All of this led me to consider[sr]chocolate to be a kind of poison.
[k]

？1：(Chocoramis said something similar.)
？！

[charaFace A 12]

＠Semiramis
I am the Queen of Poison.[sr]That makes me, also, the Queen of Chocolate.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Semiramis
As such, I must create the best[sr]and most powerful of poisons...
[k]

＠Semiramis
...something nobody has ever seen, and something that nobody but I can create... The ultimate chocolate (poison).
[k]

？1：But you got carried away and made a chocolate doppelgänger.

Until then, you will remove all those chocolate facilities you scattered across my garden. They stink of cacao.

And obviously, you will need to take all the remaining chocolate. I trust you have no qualms with that, at least, given there is no more risk of oversupply?

My chocolate is of superior quality, given the techniques used to make it. I have no use for it, but I am sure it is of some value.
