No wonder he didn't respond when I called him. I guess he must have found out about this before the rest of us.

Hey, Great De-Slack-tive. What do you think you're doing over there instead of helping me out back here?

Hm? What am I doing here, you ask?[sr]I am afraid I must give you two contradictory answers.

I am doing exactly what I always do,[sr]and I am doing something I can't usually do.

＠General Setsubun
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm afraid I have never been very good at solving riddles.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
That goes for puzzle games as well.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
There is just something irritating about a game where you cannot win by skewering your opponent...
[k]

？1：(It wouldn't be a puzzle if you could solve it with violence.)
？2：(Don't worry about it. That's just Holmes being Holmes.)

Well now, it seems my habits have unwittingly claimed another victim.
[k]

＠Holmes
Please pay it no mind, my lady. I assure you,[sr]it is not as difficult a riddle as it may seem.
[k]

＠Holmes
The first answer is, of course, solving riddles.[sr]It would seem I am something of a riddle-solving oni.

Riddles...? Then, do you mean you have already unraveled the mystery of this incident, Lord Holmes?

You know what it is Shuten-Douji and Ibaraki-Douji mean to accomplish with this tower?

Naturally. And so as not to break with tradition,[sr]I shall refrain from sharing the answer.
[k]

＠Holmes
You are a gamer, so I imagine you[sr]will understand my reasoning.
[k]

＠Holmes
It would be the height of boorishness to reveal a game's secrets so early on.

Ah! You mean like when people go around posting spoilers!? Of course I am familiar with that!
[k]

＠General Setsubun
Those scoundrels who so callously reveal the last boss's name are far worse than any wicked demon!
[k]

＠General Setsubun
Indeed, just the other day I stuffed Lord Blackbeard into a barrel and inferno'd it after he told me the heroine is the true last boss of the game I am currently playing!
[k]

？1：(I've heard THAT one before...)
？2：(I can totally see that happening...)

That is why I have chosen to remain silent on this matter. Furthermore, this time, I am not here at anyone's behest.
[k]

＠Holmes
Given that this is a highly personal case, I decided I was entitled to act for my own reasons as well.
[k]

＠Holmes
Specifically, this reason...

＠Holmes
Mmm... Delicious.
[k]

＠Holmes
Indeed, the only complaint I could make about Chaldea would be its limited assortment of wines.
[k]

＠Holmes
Servant though I may be, I still enjoy a good Bordeaux or Tokay from time to time.
[k]

＠Holmes
Of course, strictly speaking this is not the genuine article...but it is quite a creditable reproduction.
[k]

＠Holmes
Doubtless it is the result of such an...avid drinker tapping into an abundant magical energy source.

In fact, I've got a special mission for you on this floor and this floor only.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Beat the hell out of that lazy wino and drag him back here! Preferably kicking and screaming!
