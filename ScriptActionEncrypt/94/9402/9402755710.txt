I'm gonna step out to that café for a bit. I hear they got a real pretty maid with short hair working there...

If I see someone reading a romantic comedy I made right in front of me, and they start grinning or laughing, well...

So I'm gonna make myself scarce before I end up roasting a customer. Good luck. Don't let me down.

Good morning!

＠Blackbeard
Ooh, this is kind of cute![sr]I'll take a copy, if you please!
[k]

？1：It's a wholesome romantic comedy, Blackbeard.
？2：Don't expect much skin from this one.

？！

[charaFace C 2]
＠Blackbeard
No problem here. There's room enough for rom-coms and ecchi comedies in this wide world!
[k]

＠Blackbeard
The former gives me a chance to exercise my imagination in picturing what happens after it fades to black!
[k]

＠Blackbeard
That said, if you DO decide you want to swim into more adult waters in a spin-off, you have my full support!

...I really sympathize with[sr]this green-haired love interest.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Kiyohime
No matter how fervently she pursues the object of her affections, he only has eyes for the blonde.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Kiyohime
It's obvious he should end up with the delicate, modest, beautiful green-haired girl and live with her forever and ever. What could he be thinking!?
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Kiyohime
If he starts lying to her because he doesn't know what else to say, I think I might just snap! (Short burst of flame)
[k]

？1：Whoa, whoa, whoa!
？2：You're burning the book!
？！

[charaFace E 1]
＠Kiyohime
Oh, I'm sorry. At any rate, I really love this character you've come up with. I can't help but want to root for her.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
If she and her love end up Romeo and Julieting themselves, I can live with that.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Kiyohime
Anyway, I'll take three copies, please.[sr]Including the one I burned.

Oh? I thought I would have to ban this book for corrupting innocent young minds, but perhaps not...
[k]

[charaFace G 7]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I see now this older dark-haired love interest is merely trying to protect the protagonist in her own motherly way.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
What a touching story... I would be happy[sr]to let my own children read this book.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Why, it's positively brimming with opportunities to further their moral education.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
It would be perfect for teaching them to always listen to their mother, and for extolling the virtues of bathing and sleeping together...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I'll take three copies, please.[sr]One for me, and one for each of my children.

H-hmm, so the main character and this love interest were hitting it off before circumstances forced them apart, huh.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
Those sorts of things do happen on long adventures.[sr]N-not that I'm speaking from experience!
[k]

[charaFace F 13]
＠Ereshkigal
Oh... The main character might not have spelled it out, but he really treasured the memories they shared...
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Ereshkigal
I like that. This kind of story is right up my alley! In all matters, be true to thyself, as they say!
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Ereshkigal
The more...p-provocative scenes aren't really my thing, but I guess that's just how it is for two people in love.
[k]

＠Ereshkigal
So if you ever put out a more adult version,[sr]I'll just have to make my peace with it.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Ereshkigal
And on that note, in the hopes that this is only book one of an eventual ten book series...
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Ereshkigal
I'll take ten copies,[sr]so I can donate nine to Kur's library!

We also heard some feedback from customers who purchased copies in the morning. However, it was mostly stuff like:
[k]

＠Mash
“The next one should focus on the kouhai.” “The next one should focus on the classmate.” “The next one should focus on the senpai.” “The next one should focus on the mother”...
[k]

[charaFace B 12]
＠Mash
...I guess this is one of the hard parts of having such a large cast. You can't focus on one character without neglecting the others...
[k]

＠Mash
So it may be very difficult to make something that would live up to everyone's expectations.

Yeah. Stacking up love interests like this feels a lot like playing one of those games where you try to stack a wood tower without letting it fall.

'Course, reading with bated breath to see which love interest is left standing is all part of the fun.

Regardless, this was one of the hardest stories I've done so far. The longer it goes on, the more the conclusion weighs on the readers and creator.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
...This genre might've been a little too much for us to handle. Next time, we'll have to make it a one-shot...
