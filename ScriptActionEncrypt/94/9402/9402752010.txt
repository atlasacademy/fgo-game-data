After hours upon hours of hard work, our twenty-odd-page manga is finally about to be born.
[k]

＠
...Looking back on it now, I still can't quite tell[sr]if it was worth it or not. It's a strange feeling.
[k]

＠
Only two days left to go. It looks as though we'll be done on time...only now, Master's starting to show signs of exhaustion. Not that I blame [&him:her].
[k]

＠
Since we can't have [&him:her] burning out,[sr]I decided to have [&him:her] take half of today off.
