...At first, I was just drawing manga to beat her. Then, I became obsessed with improving my craft.

...And now, I'm chasing after something. Something that's almost...but not quite in my grasp.

But...when I do finally get hold of it, this dream will be over. Mmm... And it's been such a long dream.

...You're probably right, annoying as it is.[sr]As it stands now, the ending is kinda cheap.

It's not about whether it's a happy ending[sr]or a “bad” one. It just doesn't feel earned.

What do you think of adding a scene like this to make the new ending more convincing?

＠Jeanne Alter
But what?
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Jeanne Alter
It'll increase the number of pages we need to draw?[wt 0.4][charaFace A 4][sr]...Well, yeah, that's true...

[charaFace A 8]

＠Jeanne Alter
Ugh. Yeah, that's true...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Jeanne Alter
I guess it would be pretty tough to add another page or two now, when we're only just squeaking by as it is.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
...But...the story needs this scene.
[k]

？1：It's also kind of a downer.

[charaFace A 16]

＠Jeanne Alter
...W-well yeah, I know it's not[sr]one of those fun action scenes...
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
...but if the monster's body and soul are gonna end up all battered, there has to be a battle here, right?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
It's not enough to just tell the reader about it.[sr]We have to show it.
[k]

？2：Then we'll have to rework the entire story structure.

[charaFace A 16]

＠Jeanne Alter
...Y-yeah, I guess so, huh.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
We'll have to go over the draft again... Restructure the pages... Tighten up the panel layout...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠Jeanne Alter
...Guess it's no use. We'll never finish in time.
[k]

？1：What if we got everyone else to pitch in?
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Jeanne Alter
You and I are already doing all the heavy lifting. I'd say Mash is the only one who could help out at all.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
So we'd have to adjust the panel layouts, add background characters in the battle scene, and...and...
[k]

[charaFace A 15]

＠Jeanne Alter
...Ugggh. I'm sorry, I need to go out for a bit.
