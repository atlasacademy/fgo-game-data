You've got such a goofy look on your face.[sr]Did something scare you?

[charaFace A 14]

Oh, the room?[sr]Heck, half of this is just a backdrop.

The rest is just furniture I had[sr]Miss Da Vinci scrounge up.

[charaFace A 11]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
I've gotta tell you,[sr]this Chaldea place is so drab and empty.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Well, since you've come, why don't you sit over there and warm yourself by the brazier?
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Want a cuppa? If you're okay with re-re-re-used tea leaves, that is! Ahaha!

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Actually, I was just hoping for someone to chat with.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
I'm gonna get some paintings done at the same time, but don't mind me.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Come on up, and just make yourself at home.
[k]

？1：(But this place is so messy, I can't even see the floor...)
？！

？1：A painting commissioned by someone at Chaldea?
？！

[charaFace A 9]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Yeah, that's right![sr]I've been taking requests from my fellow Servants.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
I figured it'd be a good opportunity[sr]to introduce myself to the folks here.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Actually, I'd rather they just[sr]let me paint what I wanna paint...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
But since the requests are starting to pile up,[sr]I thought I'd tackle them all at once.
[k]

？1：I see. Can I ask who made these requests?
？！

[charaFace A 15]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Hmmm...I think I'd rather keep that a secret...
[k]

First is...[charaFace B 7][charaPut B 2][charaFadeTime B 0.4 0.7]Miss Osakabehime.
[k]

[charaFace A 16]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
She's apparently something called a “guest writer,” and has the tightest deadline, so I'm handling her first.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Next is [charaFadeout B 0.1][charaFace C 0][charaPut C 2][charaFadeTime C 0.4 0.7]Mister Andersen. His request is for some[sr]illustrations for his latest picture book. I like jobs like that.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
And[charaFadeout C 0.1] then we have Kai Dou Maru...I mean,[charaFace D 1][charaPut D 2][charaFadeTime D 0.4 0.7][sr]Lord Kintoki of Sakata.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
An em...blem? For something called a motor...bye-cycle? Or something like that.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Anyway, he asked for something golden.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Maybe I'll try painting a golden carp.[sr]Or maybe a picture of him wrestling a bear...

But since you look so worried, maybe I[sr]should put those requests aside for later.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Mister Blackbeard even brought a whole stack of his personal reference materials for me...see?

[charaFace A 1]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
No worries. I've already started painting.

I don't mind you calling me “Hokusai.” But I don't feel comfortable with you calling me Sensei...
[k]

[charaFace A 15]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Right, Toto-sama?
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
A painter is a painter. Townspeople are townspeople. Servants are Servants.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
I know my own place.
[k]

？1：Mentally, are you “Oei” right now?
？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Mentally?[charaFace A 9][sr]Ahaha! Master, you sure are a strange one.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Little stuff like that actually bothers you, even here in Chaldea, a place so bizarre it's practically a house of horrors?
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Well, whenever I'm speaking with you, the Oei part of me is more pronounced. The physical body is hers, after all.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
But whenever we get serious in our work, it's both of us.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
This part of my head right here and my fingertips have definitely kept Toto-sama's memories and painting skills.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Truly strange, this Foreigner class...
[k]


[charaFace A 7]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
I told you this before, but for the time being, Toto-sama and I[line 2]one person and one octopus[line 2]make “Katsushika Hokusai.”
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
And it all started from Toto-sama's stubbornness.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
He made a wish on the Holy Grail, stole the Divine Power of the evil god of the Abyss, twisted logic...
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
...and yet he still clung to this world, shouting,[sr]“I want to paint the world! I want to be a true painter!”
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
“But no way am I getting' taken over by an evil god!”
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
...And he was so stubborn that WORKED![sr]He's unbelievable! Haha!
[k]

[charaFace A 15]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
But things can't always go the way we want.[sr]Just look at Toto-sama now.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
...And since that happened...
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
...it's really not that different from back when we lived in that cramped tenement house. I just have to be with Toto-sama to care for him.
[k]

？1：Were you okay with that, Oei?
？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Of course! Is that weird?
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
If I could do painting jobs with Toto-sama,[sr]with our heart and brush combined...
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
That is MY[line 2]Katsushika Oui's[line 2]true ambition!
[k]

[charaFace A 16]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
But...then again...
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
I was honestly flabbergasted when his bad habit of moving from one place to another became him moving into ME!
[k]

？1：Does that mean I can call you “Oei” right now?

[charaFace A 14]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Sure, I don't mind.[sr]Call me whatever you want, Master. But...
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Don't blame me if Toto-sama takes over without telling you! He's got a pretty wicked sense of humor!
[k]

？2：What would you think if I called you “Hokusai-chan”?

[charaFace A 12]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Hoku...sai...chan???
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Ahaha! That's not a bad pseudonym!
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Comin' all the way to the modern age just to gain another crazy pseudonym! That's something, alright!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Anyway, guess that's about it for our talk.[sr]Satisfied?
[k]

？1：I think I understand a little.

[charaFace A 13]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
It's all fine as long as you understand.[sr]I admire your broad-mindedness, Master.
[k]

？2：Anyway, please give me chocolates?

[charaFace A 5]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Ahh? You're persistent![sr]I already said I don't know what the heck that is!
