After a long and bloody fight, both the monster's body and soul are bruised and battered.

[charaFace C 12]

＠Jeanne
And the princess's love...[sr][wt 0.7][charaFace C 5]wouldn't be enough to revive him.

It should be something more all-encompassing, something that transcends love altogether. Don't you think?

Something bigger than love would be way too[sr]good for this monster. It'd just be a waste.

Because he's been doing everything[sr]he can on his own up to this point.

Do you really think he'd be happy to be loved by something intangible like a country or community?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Jeanne Alter
...No, he wouldn't. And the princess's love for him isn't given freely, and it isn't platonic.

[charaFace B 5]

It needs to be more self-righteous and possessive... Like she wants to keep him all for herself.
