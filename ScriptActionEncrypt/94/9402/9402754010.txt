I'm going to have to give the staff at Chaldea's Hawaiian office a veeery stern talking-to, so they know better than to go around making hopeful observations!

Well, since the goal is to weaken me, I was thinking the easiest way to do that would be in battle.

I already scattered some clones of myself around Luluhawa, so just go take them all out.
[k]

＠BB
The more of a name you make for yourselves in Luluhawa, the more people will want to jump on your bandwagon.
[k]

＠BB
That'll get my clones to come out of hiding and attack, as they won't like all that attention going to you instead.
