I guess this'll work for this loop's story. Hmm, though I still think it could be improved a little.
[k]

？1：Really? I think this could make for a really fun read.
？！

[charaFace B 0]

＠Jeanne Alter
Yeah, I guess you're right.[sr]...Okay, let's do this, [%1].

[charaFace B 6]

＠Jeanne Alter
This manga will help us debut with a real splash!
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
And this time, we're gonna beat that[sr]photo book and you-know-who's manga!
[k]

？1：You know it!

＠Jeanne Alter
By the way, there's something that's been nagging[sr]at me. Come out on the balcony and I'll show you.

Yeah, that's it. That mountain over there.

Mauna Kea.

[charaFace B 13]

＠Jeanne Alter
Normally, you wouldn't be able to see it from here, since it's supposed to be on the island of Hawaii...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Jeanne Alter
...but now that the islands have combined together, it's a lot closer. Wanna see if we can walk there?

？！

[charaFace B 6]

＠Jeanne Alter
Things like this, it's best to just up[sr]and do them as soon as they come to mind.

Worried you might not have the legs for it?[sr]You are technically human, I guess.

It might be one of Hawaii's most famous tourist attractions, but it's also the most opposed to the whole tropical island thing.
