...Ahh. I can feel the water seeping into every nook and cranny of my gears. It is a very pleasant sensation...

As such, I was hoping that, by virtue of removing as much of our external armaments as possible to enter the bath...
[k]

＠Danzo
...a frank exchange of information about our internal mechanisms and hidden parts might arise naturally.

By better knowing oneself, and knowing others, I can record the differences and make better use of my abilities.

Once I do that, I am certain my efforts will be rewarded.
