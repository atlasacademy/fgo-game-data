Good, we have nearly reached the tenth floor.
[k]

？1：Are you feeling all right?
？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠General Setsubun
Oh yes, I am not the least bit inebriated.[sr]Thank you for your concern, Master.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
I admit I was a bit worried about what might happen,[sr]but it seems the oni alcohol fumes need not have been a cause for concern.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
As long as we keep our spirits high,[sr]there is nothing we cannot do!

That's...Katsushika Hokusai, isn't it. Well, I suppose it would be more accurate to say “the father and daughter team of Katsushika Hokusai.”

My art, of course. What, didja think I was gonna use my paint to make soba or somethin'?

[charaFace D 9]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
I gotta say though, that oni from Mt. Ooe's really generous!

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Take a gander at all the rare paints she got me![sr]I feel like the court artist to the Tokugawa family!

I wouldn't say instructions. It's more like...I just can't say no to girls who look like that. I used to have a little sister, you know.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
So when they look up at me with their big doe[sr]eyes and ask for a favor, all I can say is yes!
[k]

[charaFace D 14]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Course, with her offerin' me pretty much any kinda paint I could want, a place all my own where I don't gotta think about nothin' but my art...
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
...AND a buncha new subjects I ain't heard sight nor sound of before making their way to me of their own accord...
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
With all that, there was no way[sr]I was gonna turn her down! Hahaha!
[k]

？1：Subjects...?
？！

[charaFace D 1]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
What, you serious, Master?[sr]Just take a look around.
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
You're surrounded by warriors, generals, monsters, and fairies that look like they walked outta a picture book.

If anyone's being rude,[sr]it's ME, ya dummy!
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
After seein' how valiant, graceful, and sad you are behind those big red eyes of yours, it'd be rude of me NOT to paint you!
[k]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
If I just let you go now, the deity of art'd whap me on the head askin' why I passed you up!

＠Katsushika Hokusai
If you ask an artist to choose between the brush and the chopsticks, it'd be the brush every time. Hell, if she ain't careful, she might end up eatin' with her brush.

[charaFace D 10]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
You know, Toto-sama actually did that a good few times before he realized his mistake and spat out his miso soup... Such a waste of good food...

＠Katsushika Hokusai
My brush's itchin' to paint you too. Be warned, if you come at me thinkin' I'm just some little girl who paints, that choice of yours will be your last mistake!
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
My brush can paint anything and everything. That includes pain, numbness, and shortness of breath, so don't you forget it!

[charaFace D 2]

＠Katsushika Hokusai
Now come on! I'll show you how Hokusai, the great painter of Edo, handles herself in a scrap!
