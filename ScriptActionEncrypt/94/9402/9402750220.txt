＠BB
See, I heard they were having trouble finding a convention center for this year's ServantFes, and I thought I could help.
[k]

＠BB
Turning all of Hawaii into a Singularity would make sure the Mystics stay secret, so now everyone can really cut loose!
[k]

＠BB
The Servants get to make the most of their time in Hawaii, and ServantFes gets to be bigger than ever before!
[k]

＠BB
And once ServantFes is over, the Singularity will disappear and the Hawaiian Islands will go right back to normal♡

[k]

＠BB
So, for this ServantFes,[sr]I've instituted a ranking system!
[k]

＠BB
Listen up! Once the festivities are underway in six days' time, I'll be rewarding the most popular club...

[charaFace G 1]

I AM the one putting on this con, so of course[sr]I'd have the authority to do that. Duh.
[k]

＠BB
And as a result, over half the Servants here at Luluhawa have said they're going to be joining clubs.
[k]

[charaFace G 6]
＠BB
Now, I have a question for you[sr]and your group, [%1].
[k]

＠BB
What are you going to do while you're here?

＠BB
Don't worry, you don't have to make anything.[sr]You can just spectate if you want.
[k]

＠BB
After all, you can't have entertainment without creators and an audience!
[k]


＠BB
So go ahead and join a club, or just sit back and take it all in. It's up to you♡
[k]

[charaFace G 19]
＠BB
Though of course, the only way to get the Holy Grail will be by joining a club, so do keep that in mind.
