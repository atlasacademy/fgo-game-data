[charaFace A 4]

＠Captain Scáthach
The captain of the Celtic Head range was forced to retire this morning following a tragic encounter with vicious wild chickens.
[k]

＠Captain Scáthach
I'm sure you were all very excited about experiencing an authentic ex-military drill sergeant's methods, but I am afraid you will have to settle for me.
[k]

＠Captain Scáthach
Now let us have ten seconds of silence to honor him.[wt 1.0][charaFace A 0][sr]...Okay, enough about him!

＠Captain Scáthach
Now, let's get the formalities taken care of.[sr]First, I'll need you to sign this oath.

“Oh em gee, I actually shot a gun☆” or “Man, who knew hitting a target eight meters away was this easy!”

It seems you have some experience[sr]with firearms then. Good call.

...and you want to try firing slugs from the Mu870 too, huh? Along with twenty rounds from the 12GA? Impressive.

Fifty 9mm rounds with the Shlock 17 handgun, fifty rounds for an MUK25, and thirty 9mm rounds with a rifle...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Captain Scáthach
What are you, an utter novice?[sr]Have you ever fired a gun before? No? I see.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Captain Scáthach
Then I'll teach you starting with the basics.[sr]By the time we're done, you'll be an ace marksman.
[k]

＠Captain Scáthach
If you do miss the target, I'll just beat the skill into your skull until your brain leaks out of your ears!
[k]

＠Captain Scáthach
So as long as you return home alive from this range, you'll know you're a competent shot.
[k]

？1：Uh... I'm not[line 2]
？2：ALL the bad feelings about this. All of them.
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Captain Scáthach
Now let's start with the basics. Right hand on the grip, left hand steadying the right.
[k]

＠Captain Scáthach
Simple as that may seem, beginners tend to mess this part up. The right hand is only there to hold the grip and pull the trigger.
[k]

＠Captain Scáthach
The left hand is the one that truly holds the gun. Gripping it with your right hand too strongly makes the barrel drop when you fire.
[k]

＠Captain Scáthach
Naturally, that affects the bullet's trajectory, leading to it just carving a furrow in the ground.
[k]

＠Captain Scáthach
Here's a couple of extra bullets, on the house.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Captain Scáthach
Now, first you're going to get past your nervousness about firing a gun. Then you're going to learn that hitting the target is harder than it looks!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Captain Scáthach
I've set your first target at fifty meters.[sr]That's the absolute minimum range I'll permit.
[k]

？1：It's so small I can barely make it out!
？2：Are you sure this isn't more of an expert range?

？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠Captain Scáthach
This is how you stand. Elbows in, legs apart,[sr]chest forward. Look at the sight with both eyes.
[k]

＠Captain Scáthach
Now listen close.[sr]Every shot you make irritates me that much more.
[k]

＠Captain Scáthach
Irritate me enough, and the only way to calm down is to use my Noble Phantasm on whoever's causing that frustration. Get the picture?
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Captain Scáthach
Now if you want to live to see[sr]another sunrise, get to shooting!
[k]

？1：I can't.
？2：Nope, sorry. I'm out.

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Captain Scáthach
Oh? You can't go through with it? You want to cancel the tour? Well, too bad. Nobody leaves my class in the middle of a lesson.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Captain Scáthach
I will make you into a great soldier before our three hours are up, whether you like it or not!
[k]

？1：I knew I should've thought twice before coming here!
？2：All right, fine! You wanna do this? Let's do it!
