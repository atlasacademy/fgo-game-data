＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]
...What do you think?
[k]

？1：I thought I was going to die.
？2：My life flashed before my eyes.
？！

＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]
That is fine. Had you looked upon this chocolate and said it was beaut[line 2]THAT, then your life would be forfeit.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]
And that's why I shaped it like this.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]
You're not HIM, nor do you call me beauti[line 2]THAT.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]
And so I acknowledge that you are indeed a good Master to me.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]
This, therefore, is a reflection of my assessment,[sr]or its proof...or...something along those lines...
[k]

＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]
Ahem. More than that,[sr]to make a gift only of food is unbecoming.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]
And so I have made this, that you might train with it.[sr]It is strong enough to kill Demonic Boars...probably!
[k]

？1：(I don't think that's possible!)
？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]
Go up into the mountains. There, you will train and train and train until you have abs like mine. And if you get hungry, eat my gift.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]
That is all I have to say on the subject.[sr]I look forward to you becoming a strong warrior.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 702700:Berserker of El Dorado:Penthesilea]
Should you truly work your hardest, there is still time for you to become my right-hand [&man:woman].
