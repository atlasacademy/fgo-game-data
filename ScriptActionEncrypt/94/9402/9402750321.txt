I had no idea that was going down while I was getting ready to toy with[line 2]I mean, reward you for all your hard work...

＠BB
So, I get that this Foreigner is a visitor from outer space with a special Spirit Origin, and that she's an existential threat to mankind...

＠BB
...but I don't get why she[sr]showed up here at my Luluhawa...

Sure, it sounded like she'll probably come back at some point, but you can just send her packing again, right? I mean, that IS your job and all.

So I'm trusting you guys to handle that.[sr]Remember, ServantFes is in your hands♡

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Still, it is lucky that we ran into the[sr]Foreigner so soon after we got here.
[k]

＠Mash
And since it looks to be very likely that she'll show up of her own accord again...
[k]

＠Mash
...I think the smart thing for us to do would be to set ourselves up here on Waikiki Street and wait for her to appear while we investigate Luluhawa.

Basically, we've just gotta make a book, right? So let's just slap some photos of Luluhawa into an album and make a guidebook or something.

That's where you're wrong, missy. Creative endeavors start small! You think your first novel could be your magnum opus? Or your first painting would be a masterpiece? Or your first game a smash hit? No way!

[charaFace D 1]

＠Robin Hood
As the manager of this operation, my first order of business is this: we've gotta polish our skills, refine our sensibilities, and find inspiration wherever we can!
[k]

＠Robin Hood
If we explore Luluhawa, we can look for leads on this Foreigner, collect reference material, and learn the tricks of the trade!
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Personally, I think that's the way to go.[sr]What do you think, Dragon Witch?

＠Jeanne Alter
We'll scrounge up all the BB Bucks or Gil Bucks we can, buy art supplies, and go look for stuff we want to draw.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Got that, [%1]?

The success of Gespenst Ketzer[sr]is riding on your shoulders.

As our Master, it's your job to train us and make sure we don't waste a single day!

？1：So you just need reference material, huh? Leave it to me!
？2：So you just want to go sightseeing, huh? Leave it to me!
