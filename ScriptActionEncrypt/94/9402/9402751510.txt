All right, so I can kind of understand same-day printing before the con opens, but how can you offer to print after the con's already begun?

It's simple.

We send our printer into Void Space,[sr]invert cause and effect...

＠Moolah
...and finish the printing the[sr]moment you finish your final draft.
[k]

[charaFace H 9]

＠Moolah
That way, once you're ready to send it[sr]to the printer, you don't even have to!

It's our new landmark printing service♪

But you must understand, printing a book on the day of the con is a fairly difficult endeavor for us.

＠d'Eon
It is not simply a matter of being able to afford it.

[charaFace D 0]

＠d'Eon
We want to print books into which the creators have poured their heart and souls.

That is why we want you to show us how strong your resolve is. Are you prepared to do that?
