You've got a point. Martha makes a great protagonist, but she doesn't have any connection to the other characters.
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
So she just ended up going around picking[sr]fights for essentially no reason at all.
[k]

I should have caught that during the[sr]rough draft phase, but I didn't. (Sniff)

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Ordinarily, bringing a sword to a brawl[sr]would end in one-sided slaughter...
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
...but in your case, Lady Martha, I must concede that your fists far surpass any blade.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Sasaki Kojirou
Indeed, I see that in the end, you catch and snap my sword in your hands before trapping me in a deadly grapple.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sasaki Kojirou
Hahaha, it would seem my goose is well and truly cooked now. When you're through with me, I daresay I will look like one who has just been through a meat grinder!

＠Martha
Oh come now, don't exaggerate. They really[sr]captured how I would actually behave here!

Of course I'd go easy on you after putting you in a choke hold. See? I'm even giving you a chance to admit defeat!

Although...[sr]May I ask you something, [%1]?
[k]

＠Martha
Here, in the last scene.[sr]Why am I the one in the choke hold now?
[k]

＠Martha
I can't possibly imagine this samurai[sr]managing such a thing with his twiggy arms.

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Are you familiar with judo, Lady Martha?
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
I understand it has become something of a sport in recent years, but originally, it was designed to help one survive an encounter with the enemy while remaining armored.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Sasaki Kojirou
Any samurai would at least know the fundamentals, so I can easily imagine this one being able to surprise you at least once, especially if you had permitted yourself to let your guard down.

...! All right! You and me, on the beach, right now! Let's see for ourselves whether this comic is right!
[k]

＠Martha
Need I remind you, this fighting style originated with Jacob, and he used it to wrestle angels into submission!
[k]

＠Martha
It could not possibly lose to some amateur's judo!
[k]

[charaTalk G]
＠G：Sasaki Kojirou
Hahaha, forgive me, but I am not ready[sr]to depart this world just yet. Farewell!
