Same here. This one was much more about the feel of it than the think of it, so I'm real interested in the finished product.

W-well, you said you were going for a slice-of-life story, without any conflict...

Dammit, if only the cover had at least turned out[sr]a little better... Who drew this cover, anyway?
[k]

＠D：Jeanne Alter
Anybody could make the Round Table guys look good. And why's it so lighthearted? Hasn't the artist ever heard of dramatic tension?

“The Round Table? I just gotta draw those guys? Pfft, piece of cake. I can bang that out in three seconds.”
