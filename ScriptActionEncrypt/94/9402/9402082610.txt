Master! Master!
[k]

[charaFace A 11]

＠Chacha
Argh! Unbelievable! Chacha is personally out searching for Master, and [&he:she] doesn't come running. How insulting!
[k]

＠Chacha
This is unacceptable behavior for one of Lord Toyotomi's favored generals! The consequences for this egregious lack of decorum will go well beyond just losing lands!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Chacha
And if the Lord gets wind of this,[sr]it'll be [&his:her] head on a pike!
[k]

？1：I'm here!
？2：When did I become a retainer of the Toyotomi clan?

？！

[charaFace A 3]

＠Chacha
Oh, Master! There you are![sr]Over here, over here! Chacha's over here!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Chacha
My poor little Master who hasn't received a single piece of chocolate from anyone, Chacha has prepared something stupendous for you!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Chacha
Come on, don't sweat the details.[sr]Just follow Chacha!

Ta-da! What do you think of this gorgeous, luxurious blooming spring banquet!? It's like a reproduction of the Daigo Flower Viewing!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Chacha
Well, it's not that extreme, but the scenery is nice, and don't you think it's amazing?

[charaFace A 1]

＠Chacha
And...this! Chacha's favorite:[sr]red bean soup with mochi!

I call it: Chacha's special “Sun's Red Bean Soup with Mochi”!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Chacha
Eh? It's not chocolates?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Chacha
Heh. Plain old chocolate cannot satisfy a palate as refined as Chacha's, so Chacha chose red beans instead!
[k]

＠Chacha
Call me Chacha, a refined pâtissier.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Chacha
I would never let you know that I wanted to make my favorite red bean soup with mochi since I was planning on having some, too!
[k]

？1：...Thanks.
？2：...Did you make it for me?

？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Chacha
Eh!? ...Well, I, uh...well...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Chacha
It's just that, you know! Chacha had a feeling Master wouldn't get a single piece of chocolate, so this is kind of like getting chocolate from your mother.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Chacha
You know, pity chocolates.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Chacha
Whatever! Come on, just eat it already![sr]Chacha's going to eat beside you, too!

？1：Yep. It was really good.
？2：Eating red beans for Valentine's is pretty stylish, too!

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Chacha
Yep, yep! Well, that's a given,[sr]since Chacha personally prepared it!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Chacha
Oh by the way, this is just pity red bean paste soup with mochi, okay? Think of this like your mother giving you chocolates on Valentine's Day.
[k]

＠Chacha
You shouldn't get any silly ideas![sr]If you fall for Chacha, you'll get burned!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Chacha
...Oh hey. You've got some red bean on the side of your mouth.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Chacha
Hold still. Chacha'll wipe it clean for you!
