＠Mash
Senpai...I do understand what you're trying to do...but the package that Par is carrying...
[k]

＠Mash
...is definitely a present for you.[sr]Although I have to say it is quite unusually shaped.
[k]



＠A：Pārvatī
Whew...I hope Master will be happy with this!
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Mash
See? She even said “Master”...
[k]

＠Mash
There seems to be a significant amount of pressure[line 2][sr]I mean, weight[line 2]placed on that package...
[k]

＠Mash
...but I hope you know that you won't be able to hide from this forever. The longer you put this off, the worse it will get...

And for the occasion, I used my godly[sr]power to its fullest and made this!

So there you have it. This is an exact chocolate replica of my favorite bull, Nandī!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Pārvatī
Tee hee. It's so cute, right?[sr]And so delicious-looking...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Pārvatī
...Well, there may have been some slight hiccups when I thought of creating the likeness of Nandī...but let's just put that issue aside...
[k]

＠Pārvatī
Honestly...that Nandī is so bullheaded![sr]“How dare you use me as a model!”
[k]

＠Pārvatī
“There's a critical problem in your choice of gift... It's immoral.” “At least make it smaller! You need to make it a size that's easier to eat!”
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Pārvatī
...And all of the other disheartening advice that I received... That bull is going to get some supersonic waves to his stomach from my staff later on...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Pārvatī
...Ah! I'm terribly sorry.[sr]I forgot I was in front of Master!
[k]

＠Pārvatī
I am offering this chocolate Nandī to you, Master.[sr]Please enjoy it.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
I'm confident that it is the most delicious chocolate in Chaldea. So please eat every last bite of it. I'm going to come back and check with you later.
[k]

？1：Thank...you...!

[charaFace A 1]

＠Pārvatī
You're welcome! Then I shall get going!
