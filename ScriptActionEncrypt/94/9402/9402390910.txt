＠Holmes
We can tell from Chris's response that she is telling the truth. He died without ever knowing who his mother was.
[k]

＠Holmes
As such, he would never have accused[sr]Ann by writing the word “mom.”
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Holmes
No, I believe that he simply meant to tell us that his killer was a mother, if not necessarily his own.

Very well then, let us take a more roundabout approach. If we remove all other possible suspects via the process of elimination, I'm certain none of you will have any objections.

＠Holmes
Your alibis for the time of Chris's murder.
[k]

＠Holmes
You see, the culprit had no idea that Chris broke his beloved pocket watch at the moment of his murder.
[k]

＠Holmes
As a result, the watch stopped at precisely 11:25 p.m.
[k]

＠Holmes
Given the circumstances of Chris's death, we know that he had time to converse with the culprit beforehand.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Holmes
Even estimating conservatively, I should think the culprit was in his company for five to ten minutes prior to killing him.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Holmes
This means that we can safely rule out anyone whose whereabouts around 11:25 p.m. on the night of Chris's murder are accounted for.
[k]

＠Holmes
Let's start by winnowing down our suspect pool.[sr]The poker players at that time can be excluded.

Naturally. What's important is the fact that[sr]you can all verify each other's alibis.
[k]

＠Wǔ
Guess that means [%1]'s alibi is solid too, since we could all hear their snoring in the next room.
[k]

＠Holmes
That leaves six possibilities.
[k]

＠Wǔ
Six? You mean, seven, right?[sr]Why do you automatically get a pass?
[k]

＠Holmes
You did lock the outside doors and windows securely, did you not? If I had forced my way into Chris's room, surely you would have seen some sign of that.
[k]

Tch, you got an answer for everything, don't you?[sr]Fine, six it is, then.

That leaves us with three...

？1：Juliet's got an alibi too, so it couldn't be her, right?

...Yes, that's right.[sr]She also has someone who can verify her alibi.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Holmes
I wish you had waited to say that...[sr]I have a method for this, you know.
[k]

＠Holmes
At any rate, that leaves us with two...but enough suspense. One of the two already knows she's innocent.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

And that makes the other our culprit.

The culprit was not inherently opposed to your families forming an alliance. She understood it as necessary for your continued survival.
[k]

＠Holmes
That's why Cain and Laurie are both still alive.[sr]They must be, after all, for the alliance to happen.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Holmes
And yet she resorted to murder not once, but twice,[sr]and at peril of compromising the whole alliance.
[k]

＠Holmes
That is key to understanding her motive.[sr]THAT is how opposed she was to Juliet's engagement.
