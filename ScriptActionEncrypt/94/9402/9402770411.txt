＠Shuten-Douji
Hmm...
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
I'm not really sure how one should[sr]go about naming a Noble Phantasm...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Shuten-Douji
Oh, wait, I just thought of something.[sr]Now what was it called again?
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
We didn't have a word for it back when we were alive. You know, those things that tear off when you twist them, and fall apart if you squeeze them.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Shuten-Douji
Hmm. What was that called?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Shuten-Douji
Anyway, back to Noble Phantasms. If, by some quirk of fate, you find yourself with a new one someday, the question is this: What should you call it?

Listen, Ibaraki.

＠Shuten-Douji
Oni like us are supposed to be greedy about[sr]everything, you know? It's in our nature.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
So if there's two things you want,[sr]you have to make sure you get both.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Shuten-Douji
Sure, you could find one thing you want and hang on to it, or find one person you want and gnaw on them till you'd gobbled up every last bit.
[k]

＠Shuten-Douji
That's a nice, simple, modest way of life.[sr]All well and good...for people who aren't us.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Shuten-Douji
We're oni. We don't do modesty or restraint.[sr]We take anything and everything we want.
