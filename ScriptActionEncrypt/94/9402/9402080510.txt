I mean, I'm not sure why it was a good idea to crossbreed cacao plants with mandrakes...
[k]

I was hoping at least the cacao plant would make it lose the whole...deadly scream aspect. But I think that's actually gotten worse...

Indeed. We took such care in raising these crops.[sr]It would be a shame to allow them to wilt.

It would be like letting an enemy go after you've pushed them to the brink of defeat. True victory lies in finishing your enemy off.

Crossbreeding cacao with mandrakes[sr]to make chocolate-bodied mandrakes...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I'm not sure how good of an idea that was... Is this even something within the boundaries of ordinary magecraft,[sr]I wonder...?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If we just treat chocolate as a kind of poison and assume this is all being done to create superior poison-based magecraft, then fine. But if not...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...Hm. It looks like Chaldea's supply of and demand for chocolates are starting to balance out.

I had better keep an eye on the situation...
