Awawawa![sr]I-I-I...I'm sorry!

I didn't mean any harm. I wanted to give you chocolates...but I couldn't figure when was the best time to do it...

？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠Passionlip
No. It's my fault. I'm always so timid...which just leads to me acting like a stalker.

[charaFace A 3]

But I'm glad you found me, [%1].

＠Passionlip
Thank you.[sr]I'm glad you scolded me properly.

Wh-what do you think?[sr]Does it look good...?

Squeeze them harder! Your hug is like a casting net[line 2]don't let them escape! And what are you gonna do with the crab that you catch!?

＠Tamamo Cat
That's right...you need to kiss it! Whenever a huge pile of canned crab... I mean, huge spread of sweets is placed before anyone, they'll want to take the biggest of big bites!

[charaFace B 5]

＠Tamamo Cat
But this alone is just a fancy-looking treat. It's not really girly or pretty. I guess this calls for a pâtissier's expertise!
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
I'll do this...and that... Hm, it's not really...balanced.[sr]And it looks boring.
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
Maybe I'll go a little outside the box and top it with dried sardines... No, no. Stay calm. The age of violence has ended.
