Wooow, increíble! We've got a contender on our hands, yes! I would love for you to join my lucha team!

If you combined that sheer power with lucha's speed and technique, I think you'd be unstoppable!

That's very kind of you, but I must humbly decline. Fighting games are fine and all, but constant one-on-one fights feel like nothing more than endless brawls.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
I still prefer strategy games. Besides, there are still many genres of game I have yet to try.

I will not, no! Where is the fun in that! I am a benevolent goddess, but those two are far from benevolent, yes.

＠Quetzalcoatl
Sinceramente, I don't mind playing along as long as there might be[line 2]or is[line 2]a good reason to do it.
[k]

＠Quetzalcoatl
That is an act of benevolence on its own, yes!

Besides! I got to spread the joy of lucha!

Anyway...adiós mis amigos♡

She was not even trying, and yet her prowess in combat was incredible... What extraordinary skill...

At any rate, we have finally crossed the halfway point. Let us keep this up for the next fifty floors as well!

Snooort...[sr](Translation: Man, that guy really stands out...)

＠Sanzang's Steed - Bailong
Neiiigh... (Translation: You certainly[sr]don't see someone like that every day...)
[k]

＠Kyogoku
(Perhaps he only showed up here because this bath is reserved for steeds. But then, what about the man on top?)
[k]

＠Bailong
(Say, I just noticed he's barefoot, Kyogoku![sr]Maybe he's just here to soak his feet?)
[k]

＠Kyogoku
(Then all is well!)

Wh-whinny... (Translation: That aside, this latest battle is quite a big to-do, isn't it?)

Neigh! (Translation: It IS certainly a new experience, even for veterans like us.)

＠Kyogoku
(Ah! Are you a, um, mare, Llamrei?[sr]Your proportions are a sight to behold!)
[k]

＠Llamrei
(Sorry about that. I'm afraid there weren't separate baths for male and female steeds.)
[k]

[se ade145]
＠Kyogoku
(Snort...)
[k]

＠Bailong
(A-anyway, I admire all the hard work you two have been putting in. I'm sorry Kyogoku and I have mostly just been on standby this time.)

[cueSe Servants_603100 bac557]
＠Dun Stallion
(Oh no, we still have a very long way to go.[sr]Lord Bucephalus isn't here right now, but he must have been working far harder than Llamrei and I.)
[k]

＠Bailong
(I've heard rumors about him. They say he can actually respond to summons on his own, depending on the situation. Talk about powerful...)
[k]

[cueSe Servants_603100 bac557]
＠Dun Stallion
(That goes for Lord Tarasque over there as well. He may be snoozing away without a care in the world right now, but I'm told he's contributed immensely.)
[k]

＠Bailong
(I heard him talking in his sleep about how he wishes his rider were more refined, but I'll just pretend I didn't.)
[k]

[se ade144]
＠Llamrei
(Well aren't you guys having fun. Still, there's a fine line between harmony and tedium. I, for one, don't envy your situation at all.)
[k]

＠Kyogoku
(Now, now, it's more exciting here than you think...)
[k]

＠Kyogoku
(My master finally got tired of going back and forth between these hot springs and the tower, and decided to stay in her swimsuit to avoid having to change clothes...)
[k]

[se ade145]
＠Kyogoku
(Now I'm terrified I might get called up at any moment. Not that I wouldn't be happy to serve, of course! I mean, we're talking swimsuits here!)
[k]

＠Kyogoku
(By the way, I just remembered something I wanted to ask you about. May I?)
[k]

＠Dun Stallion
(What is it?)
[k]

＠Kyogoku
(It's about the difference between the master who rides you, and the one with the same face who doesn't.)
[k]

＠Kyogoku
(I've always wondered about why the one who rides you is...y'know...“bigger” if you take my meaning.)
[k]

＠Dun Stallion
(Well... There are many different elements that go into the sacred lance, so...)
[k]

[cueSe Servants_603100 bac557]
＠Kyogoku
(So I had a thought! A hypothesis, even!)
[k]

＠Kyogoku
(What if...what if your hide produces some sort of special, temporary growth hormone?)
[k]

＠Dun Stallion
(...)
[k]

＠Kyogoku
(If they do, and my OWN master were to ride you, well... I can't stop thinking about it!)
[k]

＠Kyogoku
(I mean, they're already gloriously huge as they are, but what if...they got even bigger?)
[k]

[se ade145]
＠Kyogoku
(Not only that, I wouldn't be the one carrying her at the time, so I'd have a perfect opportunity to ogle them as much and for as long as I wanted!)
[k]

[se ad83]
＠Kyogoku
(Ahh, just the thought of it makes me... Makes me...!)
[k]

＠Bailong
(C-cool it, Kyogoku! Can't you see Lady Llamrei's about to kick the living daylights out of you!?)
