I remember Ibaraki drawing like a woman possessed...

I do remember hearing strange sutralike chants and smelling an aroma that put me weirdly at ease...

Hah, don't be silly. Of course you didn't hear any sutras! You think there's any Buddhists here in Luluhawa?

＠Ibaraki-Douji
Actually, wait, hold on.[sr]I poured my heart and soul into this manual.

At some point, it must have crossed the border[sr]into the realm of the SUTRAnatural! Mwahahahaha!

Huh? What's with this cover?

It was supposed to show a (grown-up) Ibaraki-Douji standing fearlessly in front of a hundred-story pagoda during the Kyoto fireworks festival...
