See that red spot on top of his right hand?[sr]It's a puncture wound, likely made be a needle.

＠Hawthorne
If the killer used a poison like, say, wolfsbane, it would only take a single prick to paralyze the victim.

This other red spot on his hand is likely a second needle prick just to be certain he didn't survive.

At this point, I can't say what kind of poison was used, but if two small wounds were enough to kill him, it must have been very strong stuff.

I just wanted to go for a little swim, since we came all the way to this lovely resort and all.

I doubt Wǔ will approve, though,[sr]so I don't know what I'm going to do...

Ms. Violet? Well that's a strange question...[sr]No, Mother turned in early last night.

？！

[charaFace E 6]

＠Adamska
It's okay. It's the truth. And while we're on the subject, I'll admit I'm a terrible leader, too. I'm a coward.
[k]

＠Adamska
But it's because I'm a coward that I[sr]can tell which way the wind is blowing.
[k]

＠Adamska
I saw that if I didn't do something,[sr]the Violet family would have no future whatsoever.
[k]

＠Adamska
If we didn't suffer heavy losses in an all-out war with the Goldie family, we would only end up falling prey to a powerful enemy from elsewhere.
[k]

＠Adamska
That's why I came to the conclusion that an alliance with the Goldie family was our only option for survival.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

＠Adamska
I never had anything going for me besides my family name. I was never cut out for this world.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]

＠Adamska
I was just lucky enough to receive an offer for an arranged marriage with the Violet family's daughter. I was intoxicated by her beauty at first sight, and it wasn't long until we were married.
[k]

＠Adamska
...I thought there was nothing I couldn't do as long as it would make her happy.
[k]

＠Adamska
That was what let me do my best at a job that was frankly beyond me for the next twenty years.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Adamska
But now, I'm the head of the whole Violet family. I have to think about what's best for my children, and for my subordinates.
[k]

＠Adamska
My wife was against this idea, but for once, I went against her wishes. Especially since Juliet agreed to go ahead with it.
[k]

？1：...Did she, though?
？2：You mean, because you knew she wouldn't say no.

？！

[charaFace E 1]

＠Adamska
You really do know her well.[sr]I'm actually relieved.
[k]

＠Adamska
As it turns out, Dorothy just came to me with an interesting proposition. If Aaron agrees to it, it should solve all of our problems...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Adamska
But then, I guess there isn't much point in telling you about this. Just forget I said anything.
[k]

＠Adamska
The point is, if all goes well, Juliet will be free.[sr]I'm sure you want that just as much as I do.
[k]

＠Adamska
Now, if you'll excuse me,[sr]I need to think of a way to convince Aaron.
