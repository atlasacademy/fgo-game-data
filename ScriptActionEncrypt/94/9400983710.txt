I cannot stand how cramped it is.
[k]

？1：What's wrong?
？2：Is the ceiling in your way?

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Gorgon
This place is so small, too cramped. Everything is so enclosed. I require a ceiling at least double this height.
[k]

＠Gorgon
If you are the contractor who summoned me, do something about it.

？2：You bumped your head. Does it hurt?

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Gorgon
...Physical attacks are ineffective against bodies of ether.
[k]

？1：Need to go to the infirmary?
？2：You should probably duck a bit.

？！

＠Gorgon
...Quiet, you...
[k]

？1：Let me take a look. Are you okay?
？2：The problem is Chaldea's low ceilings.

？！

[fontSize x-large]Just shut up.

Hmph. Even a casual glance from my Mystic Eyes must be taxing to you. If you don't want that happening again, watch what you say next time.
[k]


＠Gorgon
You may be speaking to a Servant you have summoned, but watch your mouth. You may not get away with just paralysis next time. You will be petrified.

That suits me, though.[sr]There is something I have to give to you today.

＠Gorgon
A gift from me to my foolish and undersized contractor...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Gorgon
...is not what it is. Don't get the wrong idea.[sr]This is simply a gift from me to my older sisters.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Gorgon
But look at me. I am too twisted and ugly to stand in front of those beautiful beings.
[k]

＠Gorgon
I do not want to frighten my sisters.[sr]I do not want them to have to recall their ultimate fates.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Gorgon
Therefore, my contractor. I am giving this to you.[sr]Be sure to deliver it to them.
[k]


＠Gorgon
And if possible... Please give some to the me that's not in this pitiful form...
[k]

＠Gorgon
...The big one or the small one, it does not matter.[sr]If possible, both.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Gorgon
Listen: Do not tell them where these came from.
[k]

＠Gorgon
Just tell them that it's from you. Got it?

I don't mind if you take a little bite of one.[sr]Of course...that is only if my older sisters allow it.
