Fou is in a good mood too.[sr]Maybe Fou knows that we're going to harvest the crops.
[k]

？1：Harvest... is a good civilization.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Heh heh, are you copying Altera, Senpai?[sr]It does seem like something she would say.
[k]

？2：Isn't it exciting?

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
Yes. It has a nice ring, “Harvest.”
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
It took us a while to make them, but now that we have some crops, our line of produce has become stable.

＠Scáthach
Yes. However, there's a lot more work ahead for us. First of all, in farming, what's important is the nitrogen in the soil[line 3]

Hahaha. Your words tend to slip from my ears, queen of the Land of Shadows.
[k]

＠Fionn
Knights like us couldn't do anything even if you told us about our grandmother's secret in farming.
[k]

＠Fionn
We can swing swords, but we knights couldn't swing a hoe right even if we wanted to. The most we could do is help out with the harvesting where it requires power.

＠Scáthach
Humph. It sounds as if you're calling me a babbling nitpicky old lady...

[charaFace B 1]
＠Scáthach
Am I correct, the guardian of Erin?[sr]I hope it was me mishearing things... but how about it?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Fionn
Of course not, I would never.[sr]However, if that was how you took it, I am to blame.
[k]

＠Fionn
I was told that I was not good at reading the room...[sr]Isn't that right, [charaFace D 1]Diarmuid?

But Fionn mac Cumhaill, you are a hero of the Celt.[sr]I hear you hold some superior wisdom, do you not?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Fionn
As I mentioned earlier, farming is not my specialty.
[k]

＠Fionn
I'm sure if I think hard enough, I could find a way to maintain the crops. However, I did not think of using my thumb for this.
[k]

＠Fionn
If we were facing a serious matter where my wisdom was required, then I would not mind using my thumb of course.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Scáthach
Hm. Well, if that happens, I'll look forward to it.

Anyway, the crops have become an important asset to us. We'd like to take good care of them.

This is... Our crops have been destroyed!

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Calm down, Master, Altera is not on this island!
[k]

？2：What kind of monster would do this!?

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Please calm down, Senpai.[sr]This island have nothing but monsters!

Hmm... I cast runes around the field so no beasts could bring harm to it. It is a mystery indeed.

Anyway, we need to rid the enemies before us.[sr]Let us investigate after we have defeated them!
