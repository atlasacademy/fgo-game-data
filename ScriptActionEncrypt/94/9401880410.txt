I am Ereshkigal, the goddess of the underworld, and the leader of the Gallû Spirits who see the dead off.

You know the Heroic Spirit who's been summoned to be its gatekeeper, right? In that case, I'd like you to talk to her before we fight.

[charaFace C 8]

Mesoamerica, hm...? She sounds like a warmhearted deity. I wonder how well we'll get along now that I'm Santa Claus...

Demiurge or not, an outsider's an outsider. And outsiders aren't allowed to stay in the underworld, not for any reason.
[k]

＠???
Besides, she's a goddess of Venus, and that's just rubbing salt in the wound as far as I'm concerned.
[k]

＠???
She didn't deserve any leniency whatsoever. So as the ruler of the underworld, I crushed her mercilessly.

In Quetzalcoatl's case, I ended up making her as small as a pebble and flinging her back up to the surface.

Even gods can't stand against me. Humans have NO chance. If you aren't sure why, I'll tell you...

？1：The stronger you are, the weaker you get here.

？！

It's because here in the underworld,[sr]I have more power than any god to ever have[line 2]
