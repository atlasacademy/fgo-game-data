There's been a major development on our side.[sr]A decisive improvement, you could say.

We were able to observe several factors that were still uncertain, allowing us to share much more information with you while still avoiding paradoxes.

Why would a huge ceremony involving a battle for an omnipotent wish granter take place in the middle of nowhere, so far from the Clock Tower?

＠El-Melloi
And then there's the fact that out of seven participants, only one slot was provided for the Mage's Association.

[charaFace F 0]

＠Kayneth
Yes, well... that's why I participated. Even if it didn't live up to its reputation, it was still a fun game with little risk.

It's worse than simply not living up to its reputation.[sr]The whole Fuyuki Grail War is a fake.

The plan was to get you away from the Clock Tower for a period of time,
