Really, writing letters to Santa as a full-grown man...[sr]What a problematic adult. Seriously.
[k]

[charaFace G 3]
＠David
Yes, seriously problematic.[sr]One should limit one's childish dreams.
[k]

＠Emiya
What? King David... Um.[sr]Pardon me, but wasn't it you?
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠David
Of course it wasn't.[sr]The only one I send my prayers to is our Lord in Heaven.
[k]

＠David
And anyhow, isn't the idea of Santa Claus a bit scary?[sr]It's nothing but trouble to receive gifts from someone who wishes nothing in return.

Don't be embarrassed. All are equally accepted in the[sr]eyes of Santa Claus. Especially you in the green. You have worked hard.

＠Santa Alter
Your method of supporting your Master from the shadows rather than coddling them is most praise-worthy. Though a tad under-handed.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Santa Alter
In contrast, you in the red. You spoil your Master too[sr]much. What are you, the mother of an exam student preparing for Exam Day?

Rather, why don't we reflect on our battle just now?[sr]Despite our loss, don't you think the three of us make a good team?

Nameless One, with your AOE Noble Phantasm.[sr]And Faceless One, with his single-target Noble Phantasm.

True. We wouldn't be the most powerful team, but we're[sr]all elite Archers. With the three of us combined, there'd be no enemy who could[line 3]
