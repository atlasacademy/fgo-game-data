It's supposed to be a precious object one can only obtain at the end of a long, grueling Holy Grail War.

50 years ago, demon boars suddenly appeared in great numbers. We can assume it had something to do with the Holy Grail.

After that, we will reincarnate again and again, holding on to our memories, and we shall witness the extinction of the cosmos together. That would be the end.
