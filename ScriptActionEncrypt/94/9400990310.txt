Oh, [%1]. To see you aimlessly strolling around the halls today of all days...
[k]

＠Merlin
You must be pining for Valentine's chocolates too!
[k]

＠Merlin
That is fine! Lovers' quarrels, romantic adventures...experience it all!
[k]

＠Merlin
You see, if I'm the only one hitting on so many people, it'll make me look bad. But as long as everyone else is riled up and excited, I won't have to worry about that.
[k]

＠Merlin
If you want to hide a leaf, hide it in a forest. If you have some secret to hide, hide it in a party! That's[line 3] Hm?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Merlin
That thing on your hand...could it be for me? Really?
[k]

？1：Yes. Did it on a whim.
？2：Yes. Not sure what I was thinking.

...I see. Actually, a gift of sugar doesn't really give me much in the way of sustenance.
[k]

＠Merlin
But the sentiment behind it is absolutely delicious. Emotions are food for an incubus, you know.
[k]

＠Merlin
This little exchange is proving to be a one of a kind feeling...
[k]

＠Merlin
It's fluffy, yet viscous. It is almost too rich to eat, and yet I find myself wanting more.
[k]

＠Merlin
Hm. So this is what “sweet” is. I suppose this is what they mean when they say “don't judge a book by its cover.”
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Merlin
Yep. I must give something back.[sr]Actually, I'm glad I already had something prepared.
[k]

＠Merlin
Take this. It's a special artisanal creation of mine, and it has no monetary value.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Merlin
To give you a bit of insight, he and I are quite similar. You may say that even the circumstances of how we came about are similar.
[k]

＠Merlin
That's why we look similar too. So every time you look at this, I want you to think of both us.

＠Merlin
We've always watched your journey from the shallow sea of this planet. That is what kept the pair of us going.
