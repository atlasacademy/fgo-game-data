The Château d'If?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
It was a prison tower that existed in France, in the Bay of Marseille. It was a fortress built in the 16th century.
[k]

＠Mash
It was primarily used to hold political and ideological offenders.
[k]

＠Mash
But the prison was closed at the end of the 19th century, and now it's just a historical site.
[k]

＠Mash
It became world-famous after Dumas wrote his[sr]novel[line 3]

[line 3]Can you hear me, Master?
[k]

？1：...I was just in Chaldea now.

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
I guess you should properly recognize the reality.
[k]
[charaFace B 1]
Haha. Listen. You're still in Chaldea right now.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
Of course you are, your body is still there.[sr]Have you not noticed?
[k]

？2：Huh? Where's Mash?

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
Your pretty little friend is still in Chaldea.[sr]And so is your body.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
Hah. I love the shocked look on your face![sr]That's right, your body is still in Chaldea!
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
What is trapped here is your soul.[sr]I said that before, didn't I?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
I know it's hard to wrap your head around the concept. The flow of time and the concept of space are different between here and there.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
These seven days may only be a single day in Chaldea.
[k]

？1：I'd hate if it was the other way around.

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
Humph. It makes no real difference.
[k]

？2：Could it be seven years in Chaldea?

[charaFace B 1]
＠B：Avenger
It's very possible.[sr]Hah, your expression just changed, Master.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
If you want to stop the separation of your soul and body, it's simple. You must pass through the remaining six Halls of Judgment.
[k]

？1：But we're back in that cell.
？2：...Do I have to start over?

？！

＠B：Avenger
The concept of space is different here.[sr]Oh, I said this already.
[k]

＠B：Avenger
We always start here, but our destination will be different.
[k]
[charaFace B 1]
Let's go. The second judgment awaits you.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
...Oh, that reminds me.[sr]Feel free to lay on that bed there if you want.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠B：Avenger
Wait for a hand to reach out from somewhere to save you, and long for a miracle.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠B：Avenger
That's the simplest solution.[sr]The rest will be taken care of automatically.
[k]

？1：...What happens if I do that?

[charaFace B 4]
＠B：Avenger
Your soul rots, and you'll never wake up in Chaldea again. That's all.
[k]

？2：...No, I'll pass.

？！

...Humph. Then let's go.

[charaFace B 4]

It was the name of a woman dear to a man who was robbed of his name, and everything he had, at the Château d'If.
