[charaFace D 4]

＠Harriet
I'm pretty sure some Goldie family supporters were behind it. It was a really cheap move on their part.
[k]

＠Harriet
But, I can't say the rumors were all complete fabrications, either. You do have to get nasty sometimes to keep control over an entire city.
[k]

＠Harriet
Our way of life is built upon the blood, sweat,[sr]and tears of many people...some of them dead.
[k]

＠Harriet
We're mostly used to things being that way,[sr]but Juliet's always had a harder time with it.
[k]

＠Harriet
That's why everyone who approached her just because she was the pretty daughter of a wealthy family...ended up running away.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Harriet
Juliet knew about our family's reputation too, of course, so she understood when people she thought of as friends stopped spending time with her.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Harriet
But understanding why doesn't make things any easier. It really devastated her, even to the point where she'd cry herself to sleep sometimes.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Harriet
That's why she was so glad when you didn't let these rumors drive you away. I honestly don't know what she would have done without you.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Harriet
In that sense, you're very special to her, and so I hope you'll remain her friend, as long as you're still okay with it.
[k]

＠Harriet
Well, good night then.
[k]

？1：...Good night.
？2：(...Guess I might as well lie down...)

If the culprit's goal is to prevent the two families from coming together, then it's quite possible they were involved in Morris's disappearance as well.

If that is so, the revelation about Chris will have completely blindsided them. As such, they may need to resort to brute force once again.
