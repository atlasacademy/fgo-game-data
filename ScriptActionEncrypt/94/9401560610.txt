We don't even have a sprinkle of cheese left! We're out of emergency rations, and my cat cans are in danger of getting used!

But I have some rice seeds I secretly stashed away. These seeds are meant to be used for the future, so now's the right time to go ahead and cook them!

...We have no choice.[sr]Quick, cook those rice seeds.

I'm gonna try my darndest to make it an appetizing rice dish! Maybe mix in some corn or saffron.

Yes, it's Bunyan!

＠Mash
When you Rayshifted back, she came to Chaldea along with you!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
The Grail that created her was destroyed, and it lost its power as a Grail...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
But it appears that Bunyan was registered to the Throne of Heroes as a Servant in exchange!
[k]

？1：I see... Guess we couldn't do anything about it...
？2：The Grail... Well, I'm sure we'll find others...

？！

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Yes. It's a shame about the Grail, but the Singularity has disappeared, and Chaldea gained a new friend.
[k]

＠Mash
This is probably the best way it could've ended.[sr]That's why Emiya is entertaining her with food.
[k]

＠Mash
To celebrate our anniversary[line 2]I mean, a new Heroic Spirit.

...And so...
[k]

＠Andersen
The annual farce reached its climax in typical fashion.
[k]

＠Andersen
That other world will continue to live within Bunyan's heart.
[k]

＠Andersen
Bunyan will continue to “live” here in Chaldea, all the while carrying her loneliness...
[k]

＠Andersen
Her existence is different from ours...we who bear the records of the dead. Yet she is also not a living being.
[k]

＠Andersen
An unusual, even bizarre girl... I suppose at least one of them can exist in Chaldea.
[k]

＠Andersen
After all...urban legends, Demi-Servants, phantoms, and AI are all possibilities here.
[k]

＠Andersen
While humanity is still unstable, all “what-ifs” are accepted and used. That's what Chaldea is.
[k]

＠Andersen
The ultimate defense for this world...staffed by a chaotic rabble...and a Master named [%1].
[k]

＠Andersen
How will this story unfold?[sr]I'll just keep an eye on this interesting tale.
