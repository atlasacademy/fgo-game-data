...I failed. Master, sorry I couldn't be of use to you...
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Don't worry about it.[sr]I could tell from watching your struggle up close.

＠Jeanne Alter
Your lack of ability is my responsibility.[sr]I wasn't able to summon you into a proper form.

＠Jeanne Alter
Why don't you blame me before you die, like the others?

＠Brynhild
Well, heh-heh.[sr]You still don't get it, do you, Master?
[k]

＠Brynhild
[line 2]I enjoyed myself.[sr]I had so much fun.
[k]

＠Brynhild
We're counterfeit Heroic Spirits. We've been able to indulge in the vice, masochism, and folly that our true personalities never could.
[k]

＠Brynhild
Thanks to you, Master, I've had a ridiculously good time.
[k]

＠Brynhild
You gave us so much pleasure.[sr]Why would we blame you?
[k]

＠Brynhild
The emotions you gave us, the fictional backstory... they're no more than a starting point.
[k]

＠Brynhild
We began there,[sr]and fell in love with you along the way.
