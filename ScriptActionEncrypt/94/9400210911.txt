It's a clean cut! I didn't feel anything and there's no blood! But there's terror and pleasure!

But that's unforgettable, unattainable, and I want to die! Good work! And farewell!

＠Good Mephisto
Though... When you're a devil like me you don't do farewells like this often!

Listen, if you defeat an evil heart,[sr]the good heart isn't going to somehow survive, okay?
[k]

＠Good Mephisto
I am me because of my evil.[sr]And I am me because of my good.
[k]

＠Good Mephisto
You are who you are because of your strengths.[sr]I am who I am because of my weaknesses.
[k]

＠Good Mephisto
It's best to disappear together. That is what we are.
[k]

＠Good Mephisto
Because[line 3]if only one of us were to survive, that would be a sad thing.

＠Good Mephisto
They say a man can't live by himself![sr]Although, I am a devil!

Anyway, I will be off![sr]I'll be joining the ghosts!

Hehehe. Hehehehe.[sr]That's wrong. That's a different me. Not this me.

I'm not human.[sr]In fact, I was never human at all[line 3]
[k]

＠Mephisto
So I don't remember what happened yesterday, and I probably won't remember you!
[k]

＠Mephisto
That's what a devil is! Either they destroy the one they contract with, or that one will destroy them!
[k]

＠Mephisto
Nothing remains. For if it did, it would weigh on me. I wouldn't be able to have fun deceiving you, Master!

＠Mephisto
Goodbye, everyone[line 3][sr]The devil Mephisto Pheles will be leaving now!

Once that massive ghost is gone, this apartment building will go back to being abandoned.

When the time comes, there'll be nothing left. Like what Scissors said, that's life.

I thought I'd wake up if I found the cause, but it's not happening. Instead, I feel more alert than ever.

This place is going to disappear soon.[sr]So Chaldea's the only place I can go.

[%1], good work. I can see the fake Singularity response beginning to weaken.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The massive ghost maintaining it vanished.[sr]That apartment building will vanish soon.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
The Servants who were trapped will come back when the building disappears.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
If you forgot anything, take care of it.[sr]Chaldea always needs more resources.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
But don't spend too much time there![sr]I'll be waiting for you in the Command Room!
