Indeed. It's a Western-style red bean soup.[sr]I liberally used the Western sweets called chocolate.

＠A：[servantName 602900:Assassin of Paraíso:Mochizuki Chiyome]
I am versed not only in the art of the shinobi,[sr]but also in martial arts and housework...

...at least...that is what I had been hoping...
[k]

＠A：[servantName 602900:Assassin of Paraíso:Mochizuki Chiyome]
...b-but I didn't know how to handle chocolates,[sr]and while I did have a taste of it...
[k]

＠A：[servantName 602900:Assassin of Paraíso:Mochizuki Chiyome]
I find it delicious, but since I am a country bumpkin who is not used to the flavors of modern times...
[k]

＠A：[servantName 602900:Assassin of Paraíso:Mochizuki Chiyome]
...please forgive me, [&Lord:Lady] Master.
