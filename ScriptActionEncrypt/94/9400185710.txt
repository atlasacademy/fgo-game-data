So this is where you are, Master.[sr]Today's Valentine's, right?

＠Elisabeth
You probably won't be that happy to get a chocolate from someone like me... But this, would you...accept this?
[k]

＠Elisabeth
I put all my effort into making this...[sr]So I think... It should taste pretty good... Ah.

Y-Yes, of course, it's only natural for you to accept it![sr]I knew you were the understanding type [&Puppy:Deerlet]!
[k]

＠Elisabeth
Whaaat, I didn't even need to worry!

[charaFace A 5]
＠Elisabeth
Huh? What was I worried about?[sr]What happened to the usual idol-loving person?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Elisabeth
Well... It's not like I am happy-go-lucky everyday.[sr]I always get a headache and blame myself after doing something fun.

＠Elisabeth
Hehe. It's strange. Whenever I see your face I just get this feeling that everything will be all right.

＠Elisabeth
The stage spotlight is nice too, but this secret backstage time isn't bad either.

＠Elisabeth
See you, Master. Thanks! Be sure to let me know what you think about the taste later!
