＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Mikon! That's what I want to see![sr]Thank you, Master!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Naturally when you think of rice, you think of me, and when you think of me, you think of rice.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
You could say that it was me who spread this stuff throughout Japan. Though you'd have to go way back in time...

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Either way, the color of the ear of rice is just like my fur, and we are both delicious when eaten.

In the end, I hope that when you see rice crops, you'll think of my tail and want to stroke it!

If only Tawara were here... No, I mustn't think of him... No, no.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
His Noble Phantasm is like cheating.[sr]It just keeps making more and more rice.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I mean, sure it's convenient.[sr]But it's like he's taking all the fun out of harvesting.
[k]


？1：It tastes the best when you harvest it with your own hands.
？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Yep, good for you, Master![sr]You get it!

Thinking of that cheating Noble Phantasm is forbidden! There's no point in complaining about what we don't have!

A child who is a handful is the most lovable.[sr]In that sense, we shall pour our love into this rice field!
