I'm embarrassed to say... I didn't get through the checkpoint. I lost my footing and fell down the cliff.
[k]

＠Benkei
It was a fortunate mistake. Thanks to that, I was able to arrive at the settlement you were at.
[k]

＠Benkei
Dear me, am I ever embarrassed about that. If I hadn't been in good shape, I would have died instantly.
[k]

[charaFace G 2]

＠Benkei
With age, my eyes have been opened to the greater truth: that muscle trumps wisdom!
[k]

Hmm. You still don't look like Benkei to me, but whatever. Hanging out with you is fun, and you don't require any sympathy when you're left behind either.

But I don't think that the path Benkei took was necessarily foolish.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
With mountains of this scale, you may as well ignore the roads when going down. Jumping off a cliff means you can forget about the gates.

[line 2]The problem for us is having to go up the mountain.
[k]

＠Mash
These are cliffs we cannot scale; even if we have the strength as Heroic Spirits,
[k]

＠Mash
if the oni spotted us while we were climbing up, it would be the end of us.
[k]

＠Mash
Ultimately, the only choice we have is to follow this mountain trail to the top.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Mash
The path is narrow, and there are steep drops on either side... There's no other way around. What should we do, Master?
[k]

？1：Can't we force our way through?

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
The checkpoint itself is smaller than the gate guarded by the great oni...but the number of oni I'm detecting is quite high.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
There's a lookout as well, so it's nearly impossible without a plan.
[k]

？2：Is there any way to get through?

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Well, I'm detecting a large number of oni from over there. It's too dangerous to try to force our way through.

Well then...how about this?
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
We'll distract the lookout and then sneak into the checkpoint.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
After that, we'll cause a commotion to throw them into confusion, and then right at that moment, Kintoki charges in[line 2]

Basically, we'll conduct attacks from inside and out simultaneously.

Wow! That's an amazing disguise! As expected of a ninja... Is that also part of Fuuma's secret techniques?

[charaTalk E]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
No, it's simply a kind of makeup[line 2] I'm simply mimicking their looks. It's not that difficult at all.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
The secret technique of the Fuuma is to wield the power of a true oni, so that[line 2] Never mind, that's not important right now.

Let's infiltrate by acting as if we're bringing in fresh human laborers.
