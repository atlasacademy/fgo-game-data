I can't remember the last time I cut loose like this. It reminded me of the time before I founded the Theosophy Association, when I used to travel the world singing the praises of freedom.

Indeed. We always end up making trouble for you, so we thought you needed some much-deserved relaxation.

If anything, we wish you would rely on us more.[sr]That man there may only be good for mass production...

So whether you need something mass-produced,[sr]or something of high quality, you need only ask.

I guess it just goes to show what you can do when you put your mind to it.

I merely believed that trying my hand at playing the villain for once might make for an amusing change of pace.

Though I do believe I shouldn't go making a habit of it.
