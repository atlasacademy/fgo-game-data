I keep chopping down trees.
[k]

＠
Chop, chop, and chop them down to make them into lumber, and ship them out.
[k]

[wait se ade82]
[se ade80]
＠
Make houses with lumber, pave the roads, and a village is made. The village turns into a town, and the town turns into a city.
[k]

[wait se ade80]
[se ade82]
＠
I repeat it over and over. Make one hundred oil fields...one thousand mines. Develop! Grow! Expand!
[k]

[wait se ade82]

But then people always yell at me:[sr]“It's all your fault that everything got destroyed!”
[k]

[wait se ade80]
＠
If it wasn't for you, the world would have stayed beautiful!
[k]

＠
Why is that?[sr]I just want people to smile.
[k]

[wait se ade80]
[se ade82]
＠
For the babies who die before being born...the elderly who shiver in the cold...farmers who suffer from famine...workers who cry from loneliness...
[k]

[wait se ade82]
[se ade80]
＠
I wanted to save all humans...help everyone.[sr]That was why I swung my axe and expanded the world.
[k]

＠
Why am I always unwanted?[sr]Why am I always treated like parsley?
[k]

[wait se ade80]
[se ade81]
＠
Oh. I get it.
[k]

[wait se ade81]
[se ade80]
＠
The thing that I needed to destroy...was me.[sr]Because I have a heart, I hurt others.
[k]

＠
Then I'll become a mechanical system. A bronze system. A system that will grant everyone's wish.
[k]

＠
Because that's probably what everyone wants!!!

But...didn't you hear?[sr]I destroy everything that I love.
