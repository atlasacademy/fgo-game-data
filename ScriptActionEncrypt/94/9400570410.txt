＠Mash
We may be Demi-Servants and Servants, but we cannot look the other way anymore.
[k]

＠Mash
We are ladies[line 2]and more than anything, that should be what takes priority here.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
Therefore, Senpai, please build a bathing facility!
[k]


？1：It's important hygienically, too.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes, that's right. It's not just about body odor: this is a health issue as well.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Mash
If Ms. Nightingale were here right now, I'm sure she would also agree.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]
＠Mash
She would've made a rubbing alcohol bath and tossed us into it.
[k]


？2：Yes...! Finally!

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
(I've never seen Senpai look so serious!)
[k]

？！

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Mikon! Come on, we're on a deserted island.[sr]We're surrounded by nature!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
If Master is going to make a bathing facility, there's only one way to go.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
When I say fox, you say ears! Fox! Ears! When I say wife, you say Tamamo! Wife! Tamamo! And in this spirit, if I say nature, you say...? That's right, an open-air bath!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
What, it's embarrassing? It'll be all right.[sr]You'll eventually come to enjoy it. Heeheehee.

＠Mary
Bathing, eh? I don't really care about that.
[k]

＠Anne
Aye. The only bathing we did on our voyage was when it rained.
[k]

＠Anne
We could make do with just a simple shower.

＠Altria
I think we should have a normal bathing facility.[sr]Neither too big nor too small.
[k]

＠Altria
One with proper walls and a ceiling...

＠Martha
That's right. Deserted island or not, we must still think about modesty and being maidenly.
[k]

＠Martha
I'd like to point out that the Roman style is especially sinful.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Martha
Fortunately, there are no Romans among us.[sr]I mean, men and women bathing together naked...?

Surely you understand that the good times will come AFTER we actually build the thing? Think hard, then take action! That's all!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Ah, but let me just say one more thing.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
My fox ears have picked up some very important information.

Unfortunately, there'll be no event CGs... regardless of what you choose!
