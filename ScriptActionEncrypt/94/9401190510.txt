There it is. Once we get through that passageway, we'll be at the Seraphix chapel. Although...

Indeed. These bloodstained spears stuck in the floor give me pause as well...
[k]

＠Gawain
I have heard that the Impaler skewers opponents with his spears and pins them to the ground.
[k]

＠Gawain
There must be at least thirty spears here... And it seems he didn't stop at killing Servants. There are also[line 2]

Indeed. My spears pierce not only Heroic Spirits, but beasts who have forgotten their faith and lost their dignity.
[k]

＠Vlad III
Such terribly dull, infuriating battles.[sr]They were little more than animals in human dress.
[k]

＠Vlad III
Truly, it was as if I were back in the holy war for which I am famous. A clash bereft of chivalry or honor.

Well well, this is a surprise.[sr]I was not expecting to see a Master here.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Vlad III
We cannot have that. No human should live in such a depraved land as this.
[k]

＠Vlad III
I shall have to kill you. I must snuff you out.[sr]I must show you God's true love.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Vlad III
Hahaha, no need to be modest![sr]Even I shall not escape unscathed from this slaughter!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Vlad III
So let us descend into hell together, my friends! We have lost sight of what is right, engaged in blasphemy, and succumbed to our desires!
[k]

＠Vlad III
Seraphix has become a blight on all that is good.[sr]Even purgatory offers no salvation.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Vlad III
We must pay the price for our sins. This very chapel is a hotbed for all manner of wickedness!

I... I am well aware of my past transgressions... I must say, I never thought I would endure such biting wit from the lips of an Alter Ego...

Enough playing around.[sr]If we are facing a Lancer, I shall lead the charge.

Count Vlad III of Wallachia, my Master requires a place to rest.

＠Gawain
If you would deny a visitor proper hospitality, you are not fit to speak of God's love.

Come! I shall cleanse your bloodstained armor with my flame!

But you would do well not to underestimate we spearmen. A Demon God already inhabits my body.
