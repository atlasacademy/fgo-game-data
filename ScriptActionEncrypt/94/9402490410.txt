Now, getting back to our previous discussion...
[k]

＠Ryouma
I've managed a bit of investigating. Between that and the data Chaldea gave us, I think I've more or less sorted out how things work here.
[k]

＠Ryouma
There are anchors made from fragments of the Holy Grail located at several points around the city...
[k]

＠Ryouma
...and each of them commands its own Servant.
[k]

＠Ryouma
Every Servant with an official class[sr]has their territory set around their anchor.
[k]

＠Ryouma
The rules of this Holy Grail War are simple: fight the other Servants, gain their territories, and become the sole victor.

？！

＠Da Vinci
...So!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Since the anchors holding that place together[sr]are made from Holy Grail fragments...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...all you have to do is destroy them, and that world's foundations should come crumbling down, taking the Singularity with them.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Even better, once that's done, the signals jamming our observations should disappear too...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...which will make Rayshifting [%1] back to Chaldea pretty simple.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Still... We have a goal, but actually[sr]making it happen is a bit more difficult.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And then there's the whole twisting a Holy Grail War into some sort of Servant war game thing...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Why would anyone go to the trouble of setting up this Singularity to run on a system that is such a complete pain in the ass?
