＠Kiyohime
... (Peering into the well's depths)
[k]

？1：(Did she just sigh?)
？！


＠Kiyohime
Oh, Master...
[k]


？1：Is it not to your liking?
？！

[charaFace E 5]
＠Kiyohime
Oh, no, it's not that at all![sr]I am deeply moved by this wonderful well!
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Kiyohime
In fact, I am so happy surrounded by Master's love and kindness, I feel like I am going to explode...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Kiyohime
I was simply reflecting on my emotions.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
...Master. Have you heard of a gentleman by the name of Ono-no-Takamura?
[k]


？1：Who?
？2：I think I've heard of him...
？！

[charaFace E 5]
＠Kiyohime
...Ah, oh no! What have I done? To have uttered the name of another gentleman in your presence!
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Kiyohime
Please do not misunderstand.[sr]I am neither unfaithful nor frivolous.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
I swear upon my own life that I consider his existence less important to me than an ant and I merely referenced his name for the purpose of knowledge, and[line 2]
[k]


？1：Uh, who is he, exactly?
？！

[charaFace E 4]
＠Kiyohime
Ahem. Oh, yes. He was a court noble famous for his poetry and writing.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Kiyohime
Legend has it that he descended into the realm of the dead every day and night via a well to help Lord Enma with his duties.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
My own father used to warn me, “Don't shout into a well. The dead will drag you down!”
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Perhaps wells really are linked to the netherworld.
[k]


？1：That's scary.
？！

[charaFace E 1]
＠Kiyohime
Actually, I find it comforting.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
After all, even if I expire and am forced to return to the Throne of Heroes,
[k]

＠Kiyohime
I can still use this well to come back to you, Master.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Kiyohime
You know what, I'll definitely come back.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Kiyohime
You've poured so much love for me into this well.[sr]I don't think there is a more suitable place.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Kiyohime
So remember, Master.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
No matter what happens, you mustn't destroy this well.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Kiyohime
If it does get destroyed, I shall come back to haunt you☆
[k]


？1：(She intends to come back no matter what...)
？！
