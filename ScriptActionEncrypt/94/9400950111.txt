Although... I can't remember what kind of person this “Musashi” is... Well, she's probably a good-for-nothing person!

In any case, we're still in the middle of a match.[sr]Hey, oni, thanks for telling me my name.

＠Musashi
My memory is still hazy right now, but I won't cut down an opponent who's lost the will to fight.
[k]

＠Musashi
We're not at war or anything. Isn't it a bit barbaric to kill someone on first sight?

[charaFace A 1]
＠Musashi
If I can scare away my opponent through intimidation, that's a perfect victory.

All I want's money and fame. Killing my opponents will only make people hate me!

Well, yeah. Obviously. I didn't practice my bladework just so I could go easy on opponents.

That said, I don't need a trail of blood and corpses following me. Only a true swordsman can stop a slash mid-strike.

I don't fight if there's nothing in it for me.[sr]Lemme see...

＠Musashi
Weeell, if you have a bounty on your head, I'mma cut it off and get that bounty! But you don't... Do you?

You don't look like you got a lotta money, or like someone'd be paying for your head.
