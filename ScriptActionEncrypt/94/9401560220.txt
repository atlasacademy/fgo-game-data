Yes...[sr]An entire herd of buffalo...

[charaFace A 8]

＠Mash
Seasoned with salt and pepper, Worcester sauce, ketchup, cheese... Broiled, stewed, and fried...
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
I feel as if we ate a lifetime's worth of hamburg steaks...
[k]

？1：What's the difference between[csr]fried hamburg steak and buffalo croquettes?

What do you think of the new Edison Brand Salisbury Steak Maker™!?
[k]

？1：Salisbury steak?
？2：They weren't hamburg steaks?

？！

＠Edison
Yes. Nowadays, I hear fancy shops try to pass it off by calling it a German dish.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Edison
But here in the States, it was called Salisbury steak!
[k]

＠Edison
During the turmoil of the Civil War, Dr. Salisbury developed a mincemeat steak using red meat!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Edison
Not only is it healthy, but it can be mass-produced![sr]Such is the dish that I, the genius Edison, improved!

Um, we haven't heard of that. So it's basically hamburg steak, right? Maybe they're even just hamburgers?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Nursery Rhyme
In French and German books, they all say[sr]“hamburg steak,” so shouldn't we just go with that?

Hmmm, but since we are in the States, I would prefer to call it Salisbury steak, the American way...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Geronimo
Indeed. Even if it is unremarkable, being prideful of one's own culture is important.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Edison
H-hm. Coming from you, and with a straight face,[sr]I couldn't help but laugh aloud...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Edison
...if only I had nerves of steel! But what do you think, Geronimo!? Was the dish to your liking?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Geronimo
Yes... A buffalo hunt, then sitting with my comrades to eat our catch brings back memories.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Geronimo
My tribe once hunted buffalo on horseback.
[k]

＠Geronimo
But there are no more buffalo. They were driven near to extinction by firearms and railroads.
[k]

＠Geronimo
Now, buffalo living in nature preserves are all that remain... Mere memories, like us Heroic Spirits.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Geronimo
...I was able to taste that again. I suppose some good fortune befalls one even as a Heroic Spirit.

Oh, but I don't want parsley.[sr]I just want hamburg steak.

We hunted a berserk herd that was threatening humans. We did not pursue the herd that fled.

＠Geronimo
Bunyan made sure to use their bones, hides, and horns so nothing was wasted. Every piece of meat was ground up to make hamburg steak.

[charaFace B 5]

We have done nothing wrong. There was no malicious killing. Do you still believe we committed a crime?
