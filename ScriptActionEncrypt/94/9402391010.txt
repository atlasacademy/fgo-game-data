[charaFace E 14]

That way, the parents would be Adamska and Eva,[sr]and the twins would be Juliet and Harriet.

It just makes sense![sr]Why would they name them any other way!?

[charaFace F 0]

More likely they were named for their parents.[sr]Juliet's name was taken from Harriet, Eva's from Adamska. You see?
[k]

＠Professor M
Such an arrangement certainly makes sense.
[k]

＠Mash
But, if Harriet is Juliet's mother...why do they look the same age?
[k]

＠Professor M
Remember, Morris was a man who looked like Mordred. It's no surprise that there would be other disparities between what [%1] saw and reality.

Something as simple as a difference in age could certainly be such a detail that was altered.

？1：Why do you think I ended up in this dream thing to begin with?

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Holmes
...Hmm. I am sure Da Vinci could explain the connection between you, Chaldea, and Rayshifting in magecraft terms...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Holmes
...but I am afraid that is all a bit beyond my area of expertise, as it were. The best I can do under the circumstances is offer conjecture.
[k]

＠Holmes
I imagine whoever that body belongs to must have had a powerful reaction upon learning Juliet was engaged.
[k]

＠Holmes
Whether out of friendship, love, or perhaps pity...they must have wished to help her with all their heart.
[k]

＠Holmes
From here on, my speculation takes a turn for the romantic, but...perhaps the moon saw that wish, and decided to grant it.
[k]

＠Holmes
Perhaps, in searching for someone with both the ability to help in this matter, and someone with a desire to do so...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Holmes
...it found you, and used Chaldea to forge some manner of connection between you, with moonlight as its conduit.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

Chaldea is no stranger to oddities of time and space.[sr]And you did truly wish to help Juliet, no?
