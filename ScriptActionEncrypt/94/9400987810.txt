I only taught Mordred how to play a game with those chocolate sticks.

[charaFace E 1]

＠Mata Hari
It's a popular game in Chaldea, and all the women are doing it with Master. That's all I told Mordred.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Mordred
Eh, what? Is this your first time playing this too, Master?

Was I tricked?
