Yes, albeit reluctantly. Still, it is a man's obligation to repay another for hospitality received. I suppose fate just has me associated with gates.

We have been ordered to block your path.

That said, I do not think Beowulf is seriously trying to hinder you. More like he wants to test your abilities.

Hm. Such inconveniences are natural to the way of life we swear by.

＠Kojirou
Our actions are not dictated by what can be gained and what can be lost. They aren't even about honor and prestige.

[charaFace E 5]

We are idiots who decided we could[sr]not live any other way.

So, how about a nice, clean bout, Martha?
