Unbelievable. I wasn't ready for this.

There's no need to be so formal. Today is a wonderful day. Both commercially and systematically. What a wonderful combination.
[k]

＠David
Valentine's Day, was it? It started in the Mediterranean, and it seems to have even gained commercial success in the Far East.
[k]

＠David
To put it eloquently, it's a blend of multiple cultures. The interesting part, you see, is that the sweets use cocoa originating from South America.
[k]

＠David
The Mediterranean, the Far East, South America. I have to say that this truly has crossed the world in a monopoliz[line 2]I mean, wonderful way.
[k]


＠David
Eh? [wt 0.5][charaFace A 1]Of course I celebrate Valentine's Day.[sr]Yes, wholeheartedly.
[k]

＠David
Whether it be a sign of gratitude, or a confession of secret love...
[k]

＠David
It's a day to convey one's feelings.[sr]How efficient. It's so systematic, I love it.

If it were up to me, I would say we should do this every week. But no matter. Everything in moderation.
[k]

＠David
That goes for business, contracts, battle...even love.

＠David
Anyway, I am a thoughtful individual, so I never fail to return a favor. You gave me chocolates this morning, correct? Here's a return gift from me.

Oh? Are you so moved to the core of your soul that you're trembling? You're like a little sheep that strayed away from its flock.

Hm? Too moved to speak? You truly are refined. Hmmm, how virtuous.

But this is nothing extravagant.[sr]I'd feel best if you just accepted it without any ado.

Though, if you want to do your duties as Abishag, I wouldn't mind that either.

＠David
If that is the case, let us head to a private room.[sr]Eh? No? Can't trust the look in my eyes?

Hahahaha. Oh come on. Hahaha.[wt 0.3][charaFace A 1][se ad186][backEffect bit_talk_41 -23,168] Why, that's because I'm serious!
