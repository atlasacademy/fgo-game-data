Master... Oh, this?[sr]If I can explain...
[k]

＠Abigail
I tried making chocolates.[sr]Ms. Cat showed me how!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Abigail
I made a bunch of little ones so I could give one to everybody in Chaldea.
[k]

＠Abigail
It was hard getting the chocolates out of their molds, so my fingers hurt. But it was really fun!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Abigail
At first, I thought a little polar bear or[sr]a fancy bow-shaped chocolate would be nice...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Abigail
...but then Ms. Cat said,“Don't do that. Simple is better.”
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Abigail
And she was right...absolutely right.
[k]

＠Abigail
Yes...I made some for everyone.[sr]Even for all the Servants!
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Abigail
I think I've managed to give one to everybody except the people who haven't left their rooms...
[k]

？1：I see. That's so you, Abby.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Abigail
...
[k]

？1：So you want to give one to...Geronimo, too?
？！


＠Abigail
...Do you think Mr. Geronimo even likes sweets?[sr]Will giving him one put him in a bad mood?
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Abigail
Or maybe I would just be bothering him while he's resting? Um...could you maybe...come with me, Master?
[k]

？1：...Abby.
？2：You know what you need to do.

Mr. Geronimo purposefully took the chocolate that got a little broken when I was pulling it out of the mold!
[k]

＠Abigail
All of my chocolates are supposed be to shaped like keyholes, but he said the one he chose looked like a totem pole!
[k]

＠Abigail
...And then he laughed.
[k]

？1：Good work, Abby.

＠Abigail
Yes![sr]Thank you, Master.
[k]

？2：Don't try to rush things. Baby steps.

＠Abigail
...Okay...[sr]This is all thanks to you, Master.

My heart is still...pounding...

＠Abigail
Ah...Saint Valentine's Day...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Abigail
When I was in Salem, doing something[sr]like this would have been unthinkable.
[k]

＠Abigail
I don't know if you know this, Master, but in my village, we didn't even have a Christmas celebration.
[k]

＠Abigail
Even the celebration for New Year's was very modest.
[k]

＠Abigail
So, even though I know about these things...I'm always so astonished when I get to actually experience them here in Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Abigail
Just seeing all the ingredients laid[sr]out in the kitchen made me dizzy!

[k]

＠Abigail
...All that is important too, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Abigail
I might change at a certain point...
[k]

＠Abigail
And I'm scared...that I might forget and[sr]leave an important part of me behind...
[k]

？1：Maybe that's part of life...

[charaFace A 8]

＠Abigail
Life...to live... Even though I'm a Servant?
[k]

＠Abigail
Even though I'm a Foreigner with frightening powers?
[k]

？2：I get scared too, you know. Everyone does.

[charaFace A 8]

＠Abigail
...Really, Master?
[k]

＠Abigail
So I'm not...the only one who's afraid...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠Abigail
...Okay.
[k]

＠Abigail
I've made up my mind.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Abigail
I'll have to be braver than I've ever been...for this!

It's...it's special...

I'm sorry, Master.[sr]I guess this...this is something a bad girl does...

I wanted to be special...[sr]I wanted to draw your attention...

I know it's a bad thing...but...[sr]But I really wanted to show you how I feel.

I can't make pretty, decorative[sr]chocolates like all the others...
