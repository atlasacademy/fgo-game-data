？1：This is...poetry?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Shakespeare
Yes. An elegant and highly structured fourteen-line poem. A sonnet, for the initiated.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
I was struck by inspiration with lines befitting Master, and so I wrote them out as thanks for these chocolates.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
For you, Master, my Sonnet CLV.
[k]

？1：A poem about me...
？2：That's so embarrassing!
？！
