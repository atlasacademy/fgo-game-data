It's a joke. I created the seven counterfeit Heroic Spirits as pawns for my amusement.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
They have no respect, affection, or trust.[sr]After all, we came into this world as fakes.

＠Da Vinci
Dark Jeanne d'Arc. Let's set aside counterfeit paintings and sculptures.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
As far as counterfeit Heroic Spirits go, you're on the right track. You said your goal was to surpass the original...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...but you've already created counterfeits that surpass the originals.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Da Vinci
After all, the originals are bound by their sense of heroism. [%1], don't you agree?
[k]

？1：They all looked like they were having a good time.

Ridiculous. What are you saying?[sr]They must have felt bitter.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
I summoned them by force, but wasn't satisfied,[sr]so I even altered their parameters.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
They may have acted as my subordinates on the surface, but must have despised me on the inside!

Listen, I'm Leonardo da Vinci,[sr]creator of many original works.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Do you think I can't tell whether something is genuine or fake? They[charaFace B 0] sincerely enjoyed themselves.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Well more than the original Servants at that.[sr]They had concern for and deeply cared about you.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Da Vinci
What [%1] said is important, too.[sr]This is a Master who has been through many scenes of bloodshed.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[&He:She] said it best. There was nothing false about those counterfeit Heroic Spirits.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Da Vinci
Look, even if you don't believe me,[sr]you can believe [%1], can't you?

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jeanne Alter
I mean... There's nothing lovable about me![sr]I have no charm! I'm a helplessly twisted little girl!
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne Alter
All I have is power, so much so you want to throw up! But can you blame me!?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Jeanne Alter
That's all I have! I'm driven to seek revenge and it's all that I have!

[line 2]Yes. That's okay, isn't it?

Whether you're lovable or charming or worthy of being a Servant...

[charaFace B 5]
＠Da Vinci
You've given a lot of thought to those things, but your conclusion is confusing.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Da Vinci
Since long ago, you've understood.[sr]You're a girl who burns with vengeance.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You should have gone big with that wicked power of yours. You should have become an Anti-Hero.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Da Vinci
And then you should've been summoned here like that, as a Servant.

I will admit my defeat, with one exception.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I admit to an inferiority complex over that Holy Maiden.[sr]I admit to a craving to be sought after.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Jeanne Alter
I admit to having smoldering hatred in my heart even now.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Jeanne Alter
And I admit that no matter how much success I achieve, how many lives I save[line 3] I'll always be an Avenger who is never satisfied.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
But even so, with all the sins this hopeless Avenger has committed,
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
if you still wish for this strength, this flag of hatred, I will respond to your summon, last Master of the world.
