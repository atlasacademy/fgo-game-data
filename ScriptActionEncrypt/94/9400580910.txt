Now we'll just let it simmer for a bit...[sr]It will be done soon, Master.

＠Mordred
Heh, heh. Now there's a nice sight! A pot filled to the brim with stew. That's what a real meal should look like.
[k]


？1：Did you grow up in a huge household or something?!
？！

[charaFace C 4]
＠Mordred
Huh? You know, Father used to...

[charaFace C 3]
＠Mordred
N-Never mind. This just reminded me of the time we were marching.

＠Mordred
Whether the soldiers get enough food or not really affects the outcome of a battle, you know?
[k]

＠Mordred
A soldier's stamina is a factor that partly affects their performance, but as long as you fill their stomachs they won't complain as much.
[k]

＠Mordred
On the flip side, an army can easily break apart as food supplies decrease. After all, an army marches on its stomach.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Mordred
That's why the quantity of the food is what matters most. The quantity! I believe you chose wisely, Master!

＠Martha
As for me...I had a younger brother and sister in my household.
[k]

＠Martha
Since we had to cook relatively large meals to feed us all, I'm quite used to seeing this amount of food too.
[k]


？1： You're like a big sister. I can tell.
？！

[charaFace G 5]
＠Martha
And you know what else? I was one of those people who always prepared a little extra in case an unexpected visitor dropped in.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Martha
Like when a certain someone and His disciples[sr]dropped by.
[k]

＠Martha
I've always wanted to have cooking utensils that would whip up so much food all at once, much like a party this size.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Martha
Oh! Dear me, it's about time to take it off the heat.[sr]Taste test, taste test.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]
＠Martha
Okay, just right. Now then, everyone had better eat this, or it would have been pointless making a whole potful.
[k]

＠Martha
Is there anyone nearby?

I was confident that this would be the wisest choice.[sr]I was right in cheering you on.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Altria
I know this is for everyone, but if you will excuse me,[sr]I will help myself first.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]
＠Altria
Stew is the best.
[k]

？！

What is it?
