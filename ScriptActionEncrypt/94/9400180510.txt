Well, Hello, Master!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Nursery Rhyme
Sorry.[sr]It's a bit of a mess.
[k]

＠Nursery Rhyme
But this was the most wonderfully decorated room[sr]for a tea party with the Choco-Servants...

Oh, you brought out some nostalgic decorations, didn't you?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Nursery Rhyme
Yes, the shining ones are always the better ones![sr]Right, Uncle Shakespeare?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Shakespeare
The moment you hear “Uncle” from a little child, there's this sweetness and an “Oh no, I'm old!” feeling, right Master?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Shakespeare
Well, well, anyways.[sr]Would you please give those Choco-Servants back to us?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Nursery Rhyme
Why?
[k]

＠Shakespeare
They are lifeforms based off the Valentine chocolates made by the female Servants.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Shakespeare
If they don't go back, the ladies won't be able to finish making their chocolates.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Nursery Rhyme
No way, you can't take them![sr]They will enjoy a tea party here with me.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Nursery Rhyme
There are many kinds of people in Chaldea but there's nobody that will enjoy a tea party with me like this!
[k]

＠Nursery Rhyme
Jack stumbles around and disappears during the tea parties and Andersen just writes bad endings!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Nursery Rhyme
I even asked the Red Person to secure this wonderful tea for me...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Nursery Rhyme
Yes, that's right! I've tried really hard![sr]I won't give them to you.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Nursery Rhyme
By the way, can you reserve this room?
[k]

＠Nursery Rhyme
It's all right.[sr]I think that you can just sleep with Mash, Master.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Shakespeare
Oh...Master.[sr]I am at my wits' end.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
The love of a child is completely different than that of romance. A type of emotion that's different at its core.

If you insist, then I will have you join me at this tea party.

Oh, really?[sr]If you say so Master...

Okay, I will think about it if you join my tea party.

M-Master, I do write stories with happy endings from time to time, but...

[charaFace A 0]
＠Shakespeare
A fairytale world like this sure makes me want to write a bad ending.
[k]

？1：Stop it.

[charaFace A 5]
＠Shakespeare
Ah, Master, it's dangerous.[sr]I really want to write that ending now!

You would be so much happier if you could just eat snacks and drink tea along with these chocolates.
[k]

？1：What?

[charaFace B 1]

Once you're at Alice's tea party, just go ahead and leave your names behind like everyone else.

Hmmm... Eternity might be too difficult.[sr]So at least just for the duration of Valentine's!

？！

[charaFace B 3]
＠Nursery Rhyme
Hehehe. I have no choice.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Nursery Rhyme
If I do this, the chocolates won't get eaten, and I can enjoy the tea party.

It's a happy ending for everyone![sr]This so fun! Wonderful!

“From today until the end of Valentine's Day,[sr]I will be spending all my time with Alice only!

I see you're motivated now, Master![sr]Yes. It always comes down to violence.

It's sad but inevitable. Just like water always flows to lower ground, and birds always fly towards the sky.
[k]

＠Shakespeare
Yes. Inevitability.[sr]Every part of a bad ending is created by inevitability.

＠Shakespeare
If things stay the same, not only will Master, but even the little girl here will face a bad ending.
