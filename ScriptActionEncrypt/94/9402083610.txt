It's not unusual for him to get up and leave without telling us, but do you need him? If you have a message,[sr]I can take it.

Ah, I saw Holmes here a minute ago. When I tried talking to him, he was muttering something strange, though...

Isn't he normally in the Command Room?[sr]Yes, I do recall something like that.

True. That is why you now find yourself in our study.

Quite logical. Hmmm.
