You were doomed from the start, but still you[sr]blocked my attacks no fewer than three times!

Pathetic swordsmanship indeed. You seem to lack confidence in your skills...but that is obviously not because you had it once and then lost it.

No, I believe there is nothing[sr]wrong with you as you are now.

Take this as a chance to work on your swordplay.[sr]Rebuild your skills from the ground up.

＠Li Shuwen
Stop wasting time telling your opponents how much better than them you are. Instead simply demonstrate your superior strength and skill.

The task is the same, of course. But changing your approach will change how you feel about it.
