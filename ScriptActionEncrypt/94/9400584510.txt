＠Marie
Ohhh, this is quite moving.[sr]There are no large statues of me like this even in France.
[k]

＠Marie
Well, it's only natural. After all, I was only a queen.[sr]I was not a hero or anything of the sort.
[k]

＠Marie
And yet, here on this island, you have chosen to build this statue of me. A statue of me, who was a nobody!
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Marie
A statue that reminds me that I was only a girl, only a queen, and yet affirms me...
[k]



＠Marie
“You were fine just that way.” That's what this statue seems to say to me. That's how I feel.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠Marie
Which is why I want to thank you, Master.
[k]

＠Marie
Though it hasn't been entirely easy along the way, I am glad that I was able to come to this island with you.
[k]


？1：It's been more fun than I expected.
？2：We made a lot of memories here.
？！

＠Marie
Yes, indeed. A lovely summer vacation that arrived unexpectedly.
[k]

＠Marie
But I suppose this summer cannot last forever.
[k]

＠Marie
Because if things were always like this, we couldn't call it a vacation anymore.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Marie
Master. Now that this statue has made our mark upon this island, proving that we were here...
[k]

＠Marie
Let us put our best efforts into building a wonderful escape ship!
