Oh, and I should apologize for writing him off as just a residual evil thought.

＠Mister Sheep
I'm shocked he had such a grudge that he was still surviving on it thousands of years after Ereshkigal kicked his butt.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Man, I'd hate to get on one of these ancient gods' bad sides. I feel sorry for the souls who'll have to live in the next underworld.

＠Mister Sheep
Yes, that's the troublesome part. Just because Nergal is gone doesn't mean the plague goes with him.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Even as we speak, Ereshkigal is attacking Chaldea from the abyss in order to kill herself.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
You see, in order to help you, she broke the oath she took as a goddess.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
In consequence, she should have lost her Spirit Origin and returned to the normal underworld system. But...

＠Altera Santa
...she couldn't do that.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
It's because there are still humans at Chaldea who remember her, isn't it?
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Gods die when faith in them evaporates and there is no one left who remembers them.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Ereshkigal tried to comply with her oath and disappear, but because of all the people in Chaldea who remember her, and the records of her battles stores there, she wasn't able to do so fully.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Altera Santa
So...it isn't that she bears any animosity towards Chaldea.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
It's just that, if she's going to disappear,[sr]she has to make Chaldea disappear too.
[k]

？1：...
？2：Why would she do that...?

I imagine Nergal must have gotten into her head.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Look no further than the fact that she's already finished her ablutions.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
She chose to cut out that part of herself so that she wouldn't be a burden to you.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
The reason she didn't react to seeing you is because she's not the same goddess she was back then.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
You saw her yourself back at the third gate, right?[sr]How did she seem to you?

[charaFadein B 0.1 1]

＠Mister Sheep
Now that she's not under the influence of a human avatar, she's the cold-blooded Queen of Kur that the myths made her out to be.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
The problem is that Ereshkigal never much liked her true self's sense of responsibility.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
After she got rid of her memories of what happened back then and returned to being the same goddess she was before...
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
...she couldn't stand the thought of letting herself off the hook just by forgetting about you.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Now that Ereshkigal knows about the outside world, her heart is shaking the foundations of the underworld.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Ereshkigal decided that leaving the underworld in that state was too dangerous. And so too, she thought, was this version of herself.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
So she tried to erase her own existence,[sr]and leave Nergal in charge.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
As we speak, she's bathing in the pure water of the abyss in an attempt to dissolve herself.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
She thinks that's the best way for her to take responsibility.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Mister Sheep
I swear. Depressing enough for you?
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Then again, I should've realized that breaking the goddess's oath could end this way.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
If only she could have disappeared on her own, and spared the rest of us all this trouble.
[k]

？1：...So now what do we do? Got a plan?

？2：You haven't changed a bit, Mister Sheep.

[charaFace B 3]

＠Mister Sheep
You bet.[sr]You know me! I'm always two steps ahead!
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Individual resolve and personal dignity can be nourishing for the soul, but that in itself isn't really enough to get me motivated to help out.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Which is why...
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 0]

＠Mister Sheep
...this is your call to make, [%1].
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
If you want to save Chaldea, you'll have to defeat the Queen of Kur.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
But if you let Ereshkigal disappear, you'll be playing right into Nergal's hands. And I really don't think you want him ruling the underworld in her place.
[k]

＠Mister Sheep
Souls would suffer and disappear... The air would go stagnant... Maggots, flies, and decay would spread everywhere... In the end, the whole underworld would be nothing more than a graveyard.
[k]

？1：...
？2：(But, if we don't beat her, Chaldea is finished...)

I burned a ton of calories to make it this far, after all. It's only fair I leave with something rare enough to be worth the trouble.

Don't worry, I'm not going to eat it. Setting aside that it's not really to my tastes, it isn't even from this universe.

Rest assured that I'll take good care of it. At least until your wish and you manage to find one another.

But don't let your guard down! You'll be up against what is arguably your most terrifying foe yet at the seventh gate!

Someone who belongs to neither the Ereshkigal side nor the Nergal side; they are desire incarnate, and want nothing more right now than to beat you two into a pulp...

It would be safe to call this foe the greatest demon Mesopotamia ever encountered.
