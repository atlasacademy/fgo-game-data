What was that...!? It seemed as though she compressed the entire passageway into a tiny cube!

She did. That's Lip's id_es skill: Trash & Crush.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
She can compress anything within her field of vision into a cube, regardless of how big or strong it is.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
This irreversible codec makes her the strongest Alter Ego in terms of sheer destructive power.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Meltryllis
Her only real weakness is her mental immaturity, but since her sense of self is being suppressed right now, that won't be of much help to us.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Right now, Lip is nothing but a defense mechanism that crushes everything that comes near her.

Milady, since this passageway has been compressed, does this mean we can no longer use this route!?

That's right. Nice to see you're paying attention, Sir Gawain. As of now, our path to the Chest has disappeared.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
As this area's Sentinel, Lip can still jump between different areas, but we're stuck without a route.
