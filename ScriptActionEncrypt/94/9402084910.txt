Master, you are always on a constant struggle.[sr]I can only imagine it, but...
[k]

＠A：[servantName 202100:Archer of Inferno:Tomoe Gozen]
I'm sure it's not an easy life to live.[sr]It must be quite the severe battle.

[charaFace A 4]

＠A：[servantName 202100:Archer of Inferno:Tomoe Gozen]
That's why...I have always been worried about you. Continuously fighting without proper rest...it must be bad for your health.

＠A：[servantName 202100:Archer of Inferno:Tomoe Gozen]
You're emitting an air different from battle, yet you are so full of life, and you seem to enjoy yourself.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 202100:Archer of Inferno:Tomoe Gozen]
That makes me extremely happy. I never knew I would be able to see you like this. Tee hee.
[k]

＠A：[servantName 202100:Archer of Inferno:Tomoe Gozen]
And so...to support and help out Master, who is always busy all the time...!

Oh, right. If that is what Valentine's Day is about...
[k]

＠A：[servantName 202100:Archer of Inferno:Tomoe Gozen]
Did you have all the individuals whom you have feelings for gift you chocolates? And were you able to gift chocolates yourself?
[k]

＠A：[servantName 202100:Archer of Inferno:Tomoe Gozen]
I'm not an expert in love, but I am always available to offer a listening ear!
[k]

＠A：[servantName 202100:Archer of Inferno:Tomoe Gozen]
Please tell me anything, Master!
