Tamamo got all excited all of a sudden and brought us here, but...

Yes, anything! From my BWH measurements, to what gifts I want the most at this moment...

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I'll give you all the latest Tamamo news, if that's what you want! Ask away!

...Our destination? Oh, nowhere fancy...[sr]I think about here will do, even...

[se ad7]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
All right. Take out the parasol, spread the sheet over there, get the basket out...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Hehehe, I figured you already know this but I've been training night and day to become a good wife!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I've been taking cooking lessons as well, so hopefully I've properly displayed those skills.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
You see, my cooking teacher Uzume-chan and I have been friends since the events of the Kojiki, one of Japan's oldest legends.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
She thus possesses the necessary culinary knowledge to survive in the wild like this. And so, figuring a day like this would come...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
...I asked her to teach me how to be self-sufficient and cook dishes that would win my dear Master's heart!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
When it comes to what can be eaten or not, Scáthach might know a thing or two, HOWEVER...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I am confident that I am better at turning those ingredients into a delicious dish.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Now come try these acorn cookies.[sr]There's bread made from acorn flour too.
[k]

？1：Can you eat acorns?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Not normally, no. Their high toxicity produces a bitter, astringent sensation.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
There ARE some kinds you can eat directly, though.[sr]As for the others... well, you can get by as long as you get rid of the astringency.

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
This here is tochi mochi, made with Japanese horse chestnut. Of course, it too needs to have its harsh taste removed.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Oh, and this is some tea made from a unique blend of medicinal herbs I gathered myself. It's delicious and healthy.

This is amazing... I think I've gained a newfound respect for you, Tamamo.

？2：Me too. I wonder what happened?

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
I was actually going to go for a “well-to-do fox at the beach” vibe at first, since we're on a tropical island and all...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
However, you'll just ignore me if I all I do is relax elegantly under a parasol. Nothing would change.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Even if that actually is the case, I thought you'd forget about me if we don't have some sort of physical contact from time to time...
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Well, at least that was the idea.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Besides, come to think of it, I never got the opportunity to explain my current style. That was also one of the reasons.
[k]


？1：You're Lancer now, right?
？2：You're Tamamo Summer Version, right?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Well, yes.[sr]But there's something more important than that.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Since we're on a summer vacation, I'm rerouting all my magical energy to my body, strengthening it. I'm a veritable beast of summer.
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
This time I wouldn't be a close-minded and unattractive spellcaster, I thought. No, I'd be an elegant socialite instead...

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 1]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
So anyway, since I am a summer beast, I thought I should let that wild side out from time to time.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
And as an added bonus, I decided to offer Master a picnic and some recreation like this. That's why I guided you here, you know?

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Now, Master. This is the end of our picnic.[sr]That's a worthy opponent!

[charaFace A 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Let's release our pent-up wildness!
