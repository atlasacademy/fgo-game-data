Hey, Master. What brings you here?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠d'Eon
Oh, be careful. Stay close to me. One wrong step and Soul Eaters or Chimeras might attack you.

＠d'Eon
Although I suppose this is just the simulator, so you wouldn't really get hurt...
[k]

＠d'Eon
The Doctor once told me that forcing your way into the simulator while it's on is a bad idea.
[k]

？1：Did I interrupt something?
？2：Should I come back later?

？！

＠d'Eon
Oh, no. That's not it.[sr]It's rare for you to come visit me on your own.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠d'Eon
So, of course, I'm happy to see you.
[k]


＠d'Eon
I wonder... Perhaps you came here to give me chocolates?
[k]

＠d'Eon
I recall that your culture practices such a custom.[sr]Hehe. I don't really think of things like this normally.
[k]

＠d'Eon
But, as the situation calls for it, I'll play along...
[k]

＠d'Eon
...What? For me?[wt 0.3][charaFace A 3]
[k]

＠d'Eon
Chocolates? For me? You're giving them to me?
[k]

？1：To the knight who always protects us.
？2：In the name of the White Lily Crest.

Forgive me. I was just so surprised, I was at a loss for words.

[charaFace A 1]
＠d'Eon
I am truly grateful. Even though I am from a bygone era, you still call me a knight.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠d'Eon
If that is the case, I shall act as is expected of me.[sr]Not as a Heroic Spirit or Servant, but as a knight.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Well... Though this may not be proof of my resolve,[sr]I have a favor to ask you.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Can you meet me at a certain place tonight?

This is not my room. Just for tonight, I rented out the room where Andersen and the other writers hang out.

[charaFace A 1]
＠d'Eon
We're not here to read books.[sr]I'm using this room because it has a fireplace.

Actually, it's best to do this over a bonfire.

But the flames from a fireplace are also nice.[sr]Sometimes, at least.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠d'Eon
These are my favorite. Even when I was away from my country, I ate these during my travels.
[k]

＠d'Eon
O, my proud and loving motherland, France. While I was away, in the darkest nights, deep in the forest... I would often roast marshmallows over a fire...
[k]

＠d'Eon
During those moments, I pondered whether I was, in fact, the knight d'Eon de Beaumont...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠d'Eon
...or whether I was just a simple traveler crouched over a flame.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Or was I merely an animal no different than the forest creatures trying to escape the cold?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠d'Eon
...How is it? Do you like it?
[k]

？1：It's delicious.

[charaFace A 1]
＠d'Eon
...Good. I'm glad.
[k]


？2：Let's eat together.

[charaFace A 1]
＠d'Eon
...Thank you. This may be the first time I eat this with another person.
