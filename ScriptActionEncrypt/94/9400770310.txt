First things first.[sr]We should get more people!

＠Mash
Are we not enough on our own...?

[charaFace C 1]
＠Elisabeth
No, that's not it! Mash, [&Puppy:Deerlet], I'm always depending on you!

But we're up against famous knights.[sr]Just the three of us isn't enough!

Also, I'm a fantasy hero. They always have a wide variety of party members to support them!

When I was an idol, I had someone on drums and taiko, woodwind, and more, all to back me up!
[k]

？1：That's a lot of percussion.

[charaFace C 1]
＠Elisabeth
Yes, we played to the primal beats![sr]You could really feel it!

Umm... So you'd like a Caster as well?

[charaFace C 1]

Yep, yep! And a cleric type would be good too.[sr]One who can use their cure magic for healing!
