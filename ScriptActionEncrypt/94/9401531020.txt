＠Prison Guard Nightingale
This lofty prison cell used to be spick-and-span.[sr]Why is it now infested with germs?

Hm. What a tragedy. It seems I must sanitize this cell by filling it back in with earth.

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
Fortunately, that is one of the most convenient aspects of underground cells. No matter what sort of evil infests them, they can always be cleaned up in an instant.

＠Nitocris
I, a god of burial and the underworld, cannot agree! Bodies should only be buried after being carefully mummified and stored in a sarcophagus!
[k]

＠Nitocris
And of course, doing that properly requires a great deal of preparation. Tombs and pyramids don't just build themselves, you know!
[k]

[charaFace E 11]

＠Nitocris
Granted, my own death couldn't really be called “proper” by any means...
[k]

[charaFace E 10]

＠Nitocris
B-but that's exactly why I know how important this is![sr]You don't just go burying a room over a few germs!

You will cease this insolence to the pharaohs and prostate yourself at once. Otherwise I shall bury YOU in the desert where you will serve as food for evil spirits, nurse!
