I think it's a good ship. Although we really won't know how she handles the sea until we take her out.

Impossible.[sr]I didn't design this ship with their numbers in mind.
[k]

＠Scáthach
I've cast runes on the ship's body so it may adapt to all kinds of situations. However, that means it also required very delicate magical adjustments.

We won't be able to set sail with them onboard.
