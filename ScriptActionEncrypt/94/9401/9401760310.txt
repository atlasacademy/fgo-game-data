？1：Please give her back her Himeji Castle.

＠Carmilla
...Well, I suppose you do have an obligation to repair the Singularity.
[k]

＠Carmilla
More importantly, it's clear we won't accomplish anything like this. Very well, let us do battle.

＠Carmilla
Because I fought her, and I lost.[sr]She is absurdly strong.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Carmilla
...That, and I suppose our interests are aligned somewhat. I'm rather busy indulging my hobbies.
[k]

＠Carmilla
Allowing her to rule over Csejte simply seems sensible.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Carmilla
So that's exactly what I decided to do.

＠Carmilla
Correct.
[k]

＠Carmilla
The mechanical you is impartial, ethical, and ruthless. She never lets personal feelings interfere, no matter who she may be dealing with.
[k]

＠Carmilla
She is more than qualified to stand above all. Plus, she doesn't suffer from chronic headaches like you do.
[k]

＠Carmilla
And since she is me, I barely feel as though I am obeying her at all.
[k]

＠Carmilla
Which is something I cannot say for the real you.

＠Carmilla
A few more years and you would have made a fine vampire, just as the legends said.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Carmilla
But instead you ended up becoming a dragon, of all things. Thanks to the blood you got from that real monster, you've become something far removed from the innocent myths told about you.
[k]

＠Carmilla
Back when I was you,[sr]I was not as headstrong as you are.
[k]

＠Carmilla
Then again, perhaps I was never quite the same as you to begin with.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Carmilla
...Well, no matter. At any rate, if you wish to ascend beyond this point, you will need to defeat me first.

If you're going to stand in my way as a woman of Castle Csejte rather than a vampire, then I'll skewer you right in the heart!

Really, El-El? You're okay with torture?[sr]Even on people you like?

I, uh...don't think there's anything I can do about that. Torture is just part of who I am...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Elisabeth
Like, a dragon who doesn't breathe fire is just an overgrown lizard, right? Who needs that kind of nonsense!?
[k]

＠Elisabeth
So I torture people I like AND people I hate![sr]That's just my style and it's never going to change!
