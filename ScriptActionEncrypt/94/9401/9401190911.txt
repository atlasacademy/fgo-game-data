Hm? Why're you so shocked?[sr]Why wouldn't I kill an enemy Servant? In fact...

Here in SE.RA.PH, every Servant besides me is going to be an enemy by the end. Didn't BB explain that?

She was referring to Servants who were lured here by her sweet talk.

But Tamamo Cat is a member of Chaldea.[sr]She is not so rash as to...

[charaFace D 3]
＠Gawain
...My apologies. Regardless of the circumstances, the fact remains that she is now on BB's side.

No I'm not! It's just that I was never going to woof it through SE.RA.PH all on my own, even though when it comes to survival, I am top cat!

＠Tamamo Cat
I chose to go along with BB, so that she'd help me majorly power up by giving me a Karmaphage. After that, I was just waiting for a chance to rejoin you.
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
I never thought my own ally would end up shooting me. Don't you know that cat curses are permanent?
[k]

？1：...Huh?
？2：...You're alive?

Hm? That hurt like hell, but wasn't fatal. Why you do this, Edgemiya? Y'know, Edgemiya as in “Edgy Emiya”?

Hmph. Trust me, I wasn't trying to be merciful. I know my way around magical circuits, and I saw your Spirit Origin was fuzzy in parts.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Those parts happened to look like another symptom I know about, so I assumed they were your Karmaphage and took my shot. That's all.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Crude, I know, but it was a matter of life and death.

And don't thank me. It's irritating.
