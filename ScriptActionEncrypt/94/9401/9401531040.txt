...Are you sure this is going to work? His disguises are certainly amazing, but I worry he's a little too...rash.

He definitely sounded pretty confident in his chances, so he'd better come through for us.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]

＠Ishtar
It'd be a real pain if he let slip to the actual Medb or Quetzalcoatl what it is we're up to.
[k]

＠Ishtar
But, I guess there's nothing we can do now but wait to see what happens.

[charaFace A 12]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
Hehehe.[sr]I just had a bit of an idea.
[k]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
A little something to ensure the future of this prison, no, this very country, will be bright for years to come.
[k]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
I see...[sr]And what's that?

[fontSize large]Environmentalism![bgm BGM_EVENT_7 0.1]
[k]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
That's right. These days, it's all about saving the planet. We need to cut waaay back on our energy and resource usage!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
I realize now that that's the key to taking Connacht to even greater heights.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
So I figured I'd start by rethinking how we use the Prison Field, seeing how it's easily the biggest energy hog in this whole prison.
[k]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
And since you're the vice-warden and all, I thought I'd save you some trouble and come here to tell you in person.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
As step number one of Connacht's brand new environmental policy...I'm ordering you to shut down this Prison Field!
[k]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
I'll even give you the honor of adjusting the control device's settings yourself.
[k]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
As a goddess, you will take the first historic step into a new era of Connacht's history!

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
I mean, that'd cause a lot more problems than it'd solve, no? The prisoners would just walk right out of here.
[k]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
They still haven't learned how to be good people yet, let alone the ways of lucha.
[k]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
We have so many longtime prisoners who need reformation, to say nothing of the new arrivals.
[k]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
I have every faith in your ability to capture these wayward criminals.
[k]

[charaFace D 7]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
Which is why I don't understand: why you would want to go and free them now?

[charaFace A 7]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
G-good point. I guess turning the whole thing off at once WOULD be going a little too far, no matter how much energy consumption it would save us.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
In that case...how about just turning it down to half strength?

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
That would lead to the same thing, no? As you know, Warden, the security of the prison depends almost completely upon the Prison Field.
[k]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
In consequence, if we lower the Prison Field's strength by half, that would double the chances of prisoners escaping. That doesn't sound like a very good idea to me.

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
However...
[k]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
I can certainly agree with your wish to cut down on energy use. That IS very important. So instead of reducing the barrier's strength, why don't we cut its range in half?
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
...Its range?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
Sí! I think there's a part of the barrier that is a big waste at the moment. We could shut off the entire underground section without losing anything of importance.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
After all, the prisoners are in their cells most of the time. They only really go out for exercise.
[k]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
So it's an incredible waste to keep extending the barrier all the way into the ground.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
I mean, it's not as though there are any prisoners digging their way through the dirt like moles, right?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
...R-right. Okay, let's do that then.[sr]Excellent work finding a compromise, Vice-Warden!
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
Thank you♪ Okay then, let's put our new energy saving plan into action! Oh, but first...
[k]

＠Vice-Warden Quetzalcoatl
Would you mind if I asked you a favor too?[sr]It's not fair only taking one side after all, is it?
