Yes, we're all here. That seems oddly convenient, which worries me, but I'm sure she has a reason for it.

＠Meltryllis
Let's get this over with.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
This is the Cruel Thenar:[sr]the area that was assigned to me.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
On Seraphix, they excavated oil...or at least claimed to. But they were actually investigating Leylines in secret.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
To put it simply, they were investigating Earth's brain waves. Kind of like stepping on grapes to make wine.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
But never mind about that.[sr]We're short on time.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_2 0.7]

I'll cut right to the chase...[sr]Please enter me, [%1].

What? You've already done that to plenty of other girls. Don't tell me it's because of ME you can't get...excited...about the idea.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
Oh, come on. You know what I really mean.[sr]You've already got the “key” to me, remember?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
This is my temple, and you have the special BB key that will let you into my heart.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
So fight me and defeat me already.[sr]That is, after all, what you never did.
[k]

？1：...I get it.

...But [%1] has total faith in me.[sr]That's why I don't have to explain anything to [&him:her].

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
Well, let's get on with it already.[sr]Just be careful, okay?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
My body might be a bit rough right now, but in my heart, I'll be in top condition!
[k]

＠Meltryllis
That's where my hedonistic Alter Ego form, which did as it pleased on the Far Side of the Moon, resides.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
You're faced with an impossibly powerful enemy, you know? One false move, and you'll be done for.
[k]

？1：...Understood.

？2：I would never underestimate you, Melt.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Meltryllis
What? Well, that's disappointing.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
I am still the queen of nectar, so it would have been nice to be tempted with sweet ambrosia now and then.

If we beat Melt inside her heart, her Karmaphage will also disappear and this area will be unlocked.
[k]


＠Passionlip
That's the final key.[sr]So please take care of her.
[k]

？1：Of course!
？2：Let's begin our descent!
