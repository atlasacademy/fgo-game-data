You're not a Servant. You're just a phantom, no more than an urban legend roaming about.
[k]

＠Nameless Master
Paul Bunyan was just a joke amongst the settlers of North America. Then some trash tabloids wrote some articles on it for shits and giggles.
[k]

＠Nameless Master
She has no basis in myth, and nobody actually believes in her existence. She's the very lowest form of spiritual existence: a hazy shadow without a will.
[k]

＠Nameless Master
But then I let her possess udon dough, and gave her shape.

No more boring small talk! The great thing about social games like this is that anyone can enjoy playing without thinking about them or even paying attention!

An idyllic world where everyone is equal![sr]To make that so, strong gold Servants are necessary!
[k]

[charaFace G 4]

That's why I used udon dough to create Bunyan's Spirit Origin. My plan was to produce a giant! To make the goddess who shapes the very world!
