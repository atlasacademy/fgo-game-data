[charaFace C 17]
＠Suzuka Gozen
We're at the foot of the Ryougoku Bridge[sr]in Tokyo...no, Edo.
[k]

[charaFace C 13]
＠Suzuka Gozen
The shore over there is Musashi Province,[sr]where Edo Castle stands. This side is Shimousa.
[k]

[charaFace C 8]
＠Suzuka Gozen
That's why it's called “Ryougoku” Bridge, meaning[sr]“Two Provinces.” It connects the two. Even I know that.

[charaFace C 0]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Apparently it's, like, January 1 today...[sr]So I thought it'd be all calm and peaceful, y'know?

[charaFace C 1]
＠Suzuka Gozen
But OMG! It was among the busiest places in the world at the time...a literal million people living there! Known as the city of eight-hundred-and-eight towns!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
There are playhouses, sit-down teahouses, food carts and peddlers, and even freak shows! So Master and I don't stick out. Sick, huh?
[k]

[charaFace C 14]
＠Suzuka Gozen
But aren't we totally in the Edo period? I can't even.[sr]Master, did you like, just time travel?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Did you think you were dreaming?
[k]

[charaFace C 17]
＠Suzuka Gozen
...Uh-huh.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
So there was a NYE party at Chaldea?[sr]Oh yeah, there was. LIT.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
And you ate New Year's udon with Musashi? And you[sr]got New Year's mochi and pickles from Hijikata?
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
And you ate sweet red bean soup with Chacha? And you[sr]gave a New Year's gift to Baraki and ate sweets?
[k]

[charaFace C 14]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Oh, come on! You ate your way through New Year's! Rather than doing traditional stuff like visiting a shrine, you're just in it for the fun?
[k]

[charaFace C 17]
＠Suzuka Gozen
...Hm? You, Okki, and Archerferno[sr]played board games together?
[k]

[charaFace C 14]
＠Suzuka Gozen
What!? Well, thanks for the invite! No fair![sr]Bah...and what else?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Nobbu crashed your game and forced you to drink some super sketch drink from a foreign country...?
[k]

[charaFace C 15]
＠Suzuka Gozen
That's it! Bingo!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Suzuka Gozen
I drank that too![sr]Maybe that's why I'm here with you!?
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
A golden, honey flavored drink!!![sr]I say that's the cause of this whole mess!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
My senses are totally telling me that! It may have[sr]been honey flavored, but it was TOO sparkly!
[k]

？1：I was told it would bring good luck for the New Year, so I had a sip...
？2：I don't remember anything after I took a drink...
？！

[charaFace C 4]
＠Suzuka Gozen
OMG...[sr]I also let my guard down from all the hype...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Suzuka Gozen
So let's rewind.[sr]Our current galaxy brain for this place is...
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
A Reality Marble, virtual reality on a Spiritron level, a parallel world that went off the rails from the timeline...or, to go totally cray cray...a collab dream?
[k]

？1：Do you really think this is reality?

＠Suzuka Gozen
I'm getting that you really want this to be your first dream of the year or something. Guess I can let you have that much. Not like I've got another explanation.
[k]

？2：I had a “dream” like this last New Year's.

[charaFace C 17]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Are you talking about Musashi?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Suzuka Gozen
I heard the deets, and I think it was more like you were in a different world that made you THINK it was a dream. But whatevs.
[k]
？！

＠Suzuka Gozen
Anyway, let's assume that[sr]we're in some kind of dream.
[k]

[charaFace C 17]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Servants don't usually dream, so I'm, like,[sr]ninety percent sure that this is totes all you...
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Hmmm, in which case, that's lit AF! I mean, it's so realistic and stuff! You keeping your genius on the DL?
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Even though I only know the basics of the Edo period,[sr]I knew right off that we were totally in Edo!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Actually, it feels more realistic than the real thing.[sr]Like some god is lurking in the shadows or something!
[k]

[charaFace C 16]
＠Suzuka Gozen
And if this is all a dream, there's nothing to worry about, and by the time that shady drink wears off, we'll be back in Chaldea, right?
[k]


[charaFace C 3]
＠Suzuka Gozen
So if that's the case, I wouldn't mind hooking up[sr]for a mini-New Year's date with you, Master. Teehee.
[k]

？1：A date's not such a bad idea.

[charaFace C 13]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Right!? Nothing beats going out!
[k]

？2：Do you really think we can get back to Chaldea?

[charaFace C 13]
＠Suzuka Gozen
We'll be fine![sr]After all, you got me here with you, right?
