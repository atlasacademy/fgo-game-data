All of my dreams, shattered in a single sentence.[sr]Now what do I do? My medjed cannot drive...

[charaFace A 8]

Hmm...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Nitocris
...Heh. I guess I have no choice...
[k]

＠Nitocris
It may be a bit impudent of me, but I shall just have to get another great pharaoh to be the driver...
[k]

＠Nitocris
...and let me help them as their assistant.
[k]

＠Nitocris
I need not be front and center, so long as a pharaoh wins and demonstrates our greatness to the world.

All right, now that that's decided...

This is awful...[sr]I was far too hasty!
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Nitocris
My first pick was Cleopatra,[sr]but after Lord Caesar declared:
[k]

＠Nitocris
“This is a time for feasting, not war. I need only grace a dining establishment with my presence to secure its everlasting popularity.”
[k]

＠Nitocris
“What juicier business could there be than that!? I shall call it 'Emperor Gourmet.' I should look into expanding into other media as well.”
[k]

＠Nitocris
...and left on a trip to sample all the delicacies of the world, Cleopatra just left a note saying:
[k]

＠Nitocris
“I'm going on a trip with my husband” and ran off after him. I don't know who she thinks she's fooling; she's obviously stalkin[line 2]no, never mind.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Nitocris
Next, I paid a visit to Pharaoh Iskandar, who was of course nowhere to be found, as usual.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Nitocris
And finally, Pharaoh Ozymandias,[sr]the one I was really hoping would join me, said...

Ridiculous! You would have me compete in an event for mere peasants!?

Summer is meant to be spent in a chamber of stone with a bowl of fruit, yet you wish to compete with other Heroic Spirits over something as trivial as speed? Have you mistaken yourself for a bird!?

＠Ozymandias
...Oh, right, you are a bird. I suppose you cannot really help that. Pay that last part no heed.

[charaFace B 2]
＠Ozymandias
However! The very idea of spreading the pharaohs' glory by winning a race is a losing proposition!
[k]

＠Ozymandias
A true pharaoh need not spread his glory, for the world already basks in the light of our splendor!

None could question that we tower over the common masses. What point is there in proving the obvious in something so foolish as a race?

This presents a perfect opportunity to remedy that particular shortcoming! Thus, queen of the heavens, you will enter this Ishtar Cup!

This is terrible... Not only did I get scolded about being a proper pharaoh...

I couldn't even tell him that I wouldn't let him down after he placed such great trust in me.

＠Nitocris
I'm so ashamed. I'm a terrible pharaoh.[sr]I wish I could just crawl into a hole and disappear.

[charaFace A 9]

...A-all right, let's just calm down.[sr]All that's changed is that I cannot back out now...

＠Nitocris
Besides, it's exactly because I'm lacking that I can't pass up this opportunity.
[k]

＠Nitocris
What's more, Pharaoh Ozymandias called me[sr]“Pharaoh Nitocris.”
[k]

＠Nitocris
I can't let him down now! In order to spread our glory even further throughout the world...
[k]

＠Nitocris
...I will just have to work harder to become a proper pharaoh myself. That is my task.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Nitocris
That said...I'm still not sure what I'm going to do.
[k]

＠Nitocris
As the registration deadline is drawing near, I suppose my only option at this point is to be the driver myself, and find someone else to be my assistant.
[k]

＠Nitocris
At the very least, they will need to be a Servant who is appropriately in awe of us pharaohs.

＠Nitocris
There must be someone like that around here...

W-w-w-waaait! You're the only one I can ask,[sr]and the deadline to register is almost here!

I'm very sorry, but I really must refuse.

[charaFace A 9]

＠Nitocris
...All right, I won't ask you to do it without recompense. You said you don't want to die, right?
[k]

＠Nitocris
If we win, I will use my own techniques and ties to the underworld to create a special talisman for you.
[k]

＠Nitocris
If death comes for you,[sr]it will shatter in your place.

＠Nitocris
While it can only be used so many times,[sr]it should still help you to escape death.

[charaFace C 5]

I swear on the gods in the underworld, the gods in the heavens, and in the name of all the pharaohs.
[k]

＠Nitocris
That said, creating such an object is the culmination of every bit of magecraft I know, so it cannot be done easily or lightly.
[k]

＠Nitocris
But this pamphlet says that the winners of this race will receive a Holy Grail from the goddess Ishtar.
[k]

＠Nitocris
With that sort of power, I should be able to make it.
[k]

＠Nitocris
All I want is for a pharaoh to win this race.[sr]I have no interest in the prize.

I mean, it already shines pretty bright thanks to all the other great pharaohs, but this way, it'll be as bright as Ra himself.
