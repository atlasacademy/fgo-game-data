Well, whatever, you filthy ingrates! Let's just get down to it! You're here to fight me, right, Senpai?

＠BB
I'm so overflowing with kouhai power that you can hardly contain yourself! You want to unleash your lascivious libido on me!

＠BB
Your attack on my studio has left me without a way out, so all that's left is to fight to the bitter end.
[k]

＠BB
I will not let you escape this time. Lose, and it's GAME OVER and off to my special Dog Space for you.

＠BB
I'll show you just how foolish it is for the game pieces to oppose the game master!
