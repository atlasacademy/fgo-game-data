Now that you've learned your lesson, make sure you start dressing appropriately and keep that attitude of yours in check. Remember, I am always watching.

Well, I can't exactly change how I live my life.
[k]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
But I'll at least (try to) dress as appropriately as possible in front of your kids.

[charaFace A 7]

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
(Murmur)...Maybe I'll even try showing up as you next time. I bet you're not gonna start forbidding yourself from dressing like that any time soon...

Anyway, it looks like we're all on the same page now.

＠Ishtar
With all the tunnels we've been digging, it should be easy to make a route to the giant statue in the courtyard too.

＠Ishtar
I can show you the way there, but once we arrive,[sr]you're all on your own.

Make sure you're convincing when you try to trick Quetzalcoatl. She may be incredibly cheerful, but she's also incredibly shrewd.

Hey, come on now. Do you even know who I am?

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
There's no one in the world I can't become. Old, young, male, female... I can even turn myself into a headless wolf knight if I want.

＠Phantom of ∞ Faces
I might be a youxia whose nature makes it easy to confuse him with a mirage, but that's exactly why I've got to hang onto what pride I have left.

My name is Phantom of ∞ Faces.

As far as I'm concerned, even the queen of this whole country is just another face for me.

So don't you worry. I'll use the real queen's face, voice, and charm to make sure the job gets done☆
