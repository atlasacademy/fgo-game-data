Our supremacy is clear for all to see now! It feels good to win first place by a decisive margin! Not that I ever believed it would turn out otherwise!
[k]

＠Nero
Nonetheless, I could not have done this without [%1]'s support and your capacity for violence.
[k]

＠Nero
Well done, Salty Maid! Our success in fending off our fearsome rivals is due entirely to our teamwork!

...Indeed. And I am grateful to you as well.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
I originally approached you merely so you could serve as a human shield if necessary, but your performance exceeded my expectations.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
The way you notice small details even as you ignore them, and consistently choose the most ostentatious and dangerous course of action...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Altria Alter
Just this once, I daresay it was responsible for our greatest achievement here.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
It is thanks to you that I managed to secure first place.[sr]The crowd's cheers are yours to enjoy.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
Now, go on and head to the winner's podium. A victory parade set to last three days and three nights awaits you.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Nero
Hahaha! Umu, it shall be a glorious celebration![sr]A lavish victory gala singing my praises!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Nero
However, while that is most generous of you,[sr]wait just a moment.
[k]

＠Nero
What would be the point of my ascending the podium on my own? Did you not say this is our victory?
[k]

＠Nero
We still have to pour champagne on each other, give an interview where we are asked the secret of our victory, smile at each other, say something like...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Nero
“What else!? Our strong bond that let us suppress our burning desire to rub the other out at the first chance!”
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

...and proceed to hit one another with bouquets of roses. Do you not wish to do that?

Do you truly believe Master has the guts for something like that? Are you certain you were not merely daydreaming?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Nero
No, I was not! For some reason, [&he:she] told me [&he:she] wished for me to win this race, and I wished to grant [&his:her] request.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Nero
It was that very passion that led to this Theatrical Essence! How else would you explain my Class changing just like that!?
[k]

＠Nero
Surely you must also have experienced something similar!
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Altria Alter
Hm, that is true... In fact, I underwent my own class change for much the same reason...
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Altria Alter
However![sr]You and I are still nothing alike!
[k]

＠Altria Alter
So what if Master allegedly pounded the wall or not!?
[k]

＠Altria Alter
When [&he:she] approached me, [&he:she] took my hands in [&his:hers] and gazed into my eyes. There were even flower petals swirling in the air!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Nero
Flower petals!?[sr]Truly!?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Altria Alter
Truly! You too would have thought it a paradise! Though looking back upon it, it seems extremely unnatural!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Nero
Ooh, I am so jealous! I too want to see [%1] surrounded by swirling flower petals, just once!
[k]

＠Nero
However! Before that happens,[sr]there are two pressing matters I must resolve!
[k]

＠Nero
The first one, naturally, is to unleash divine judgment upon [%1] for [&his:her] two-timing!

I was just thinking the same thing! It seems we truly are of one mind, Drama Queen! If we calm ourselves and consider this rationally, it should be clear that all of this was Ishtar's plot the whole time.

But that does not change the[sr]fact that you stand in my way!
