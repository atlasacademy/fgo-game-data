But I think I should choose who to give the crown to myself, seeing as it's the most important part.

Drama Queen. You and I may not care for one another in the slightest, but we have few options.

I have my reasons. However, this much is certain:[sr]I must win this race, no matter the cost.

If that means I must work with someone like you, so be it. At this moment, I require a skilled partner more than I do a familiar subordinate.
