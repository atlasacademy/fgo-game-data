Well, if you think about it, this is probably more than your everyday dream, Master. It's probably, like, some kinda vision or something.

Toto-sama is real flighty, but he's never[sr]just up and left without telling anyone.

I know I managed to make it through[sr]the Hotei-son gig at the Ekou-in...
[k]

＠G：Oei
...but actually, the original plan was to follow up by doing a miniature painting of sparrows on a grain of rice.
[k]

＠G：Oei
Sadly, the best I can manage is maybe one bird to a grain. Toto-sama would have been able to get two or three birds on a single grain.

[charaFace B 17]
＠Suzuka Gozen
One grain of rice...?[sr]That's a pretty crazy standard you're setting.

[charaFace G 11]

And there's also one more incredibly important job left.
