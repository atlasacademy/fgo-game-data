Are you done getting that out of your systems? Now that we all understand one another, let's get back to business.

You mean, back to the fact that the Prison Field extends all the way down into the ground?

＠Nitocris
As a god of the underworld, I understand how important the subterranean domain is, but still...

I knew it was possible that might be the case,[sr]but still...I didn't actually think it would be.
[k]

＠Ishtar
I mean, it's a HUGE waste to keep such a powerful barrier on all the time AND have it extend into the ground.

＠Ishtar
It must be a spherical barrier that surrounds the entire prison, so we won't be able to get around it by just digging in another direction.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Which means we're right back where we started:[sr]having to do something about the Prison Field itself.

So we weren't able to avoid the core problem after all, huh. I had a feeling that might happen.

Then we need to come up with a way to remove that barrier! You seem like you know the most out of anyone here; what do you think?

Hmph. I already told you. The only way to do that is to cut it off at its source... That means killing Medb.

＠Nitocris
Thanks to that barrier, we would have a very hard time fighting her on even ground in this prison.
[k]

＠Nitocris
After all, she possesses the power to completely dominate everything here.
[k]

[charaFace F 6]
＠Nitocris
Her very existence is on an entirely different plane,[sr]like we pharaohs and the common masses.

Much as it pains me to admit that!

Then we have no choice but to kill her on uneven ground.[sr]Namely[charaFace G 5]...assassination.

Hehe, fortunately, I know a lot about that, since I've been on both sides of that particular coin!

＠Helena
I'm afraid I don't see how assassination would improve our chances.
[k]

＠Helena
Whether we tried to cut off her head or poison her, there's no guarantee that it would actually work on her in this place.
[k]

＠Helena
If Medb had some sort of weakness[line 2]something we could exploit that we could be sure would kill her[line 2]then the situation would be different, but[line 2]

I've only heard her mention this once.
[k]

＠Gorgon
There was another prisoner here who attempted to escape by trying to kill Medb, much like you lot are doing.
[k]

＠Gorgon
Of course, he was quickly defeated, but as Medb made him crawl along the ground so she could step on him and make him lick her shoes...
[k]

＠Gorgon
...she laughed and said “If you really wanted to kill me, you should have shot some ... at my head.”
