Indeed, our task is complete.

How wonderful. With that foreign goddess's scheme foiled, we have succeeded at keeping Chaldea decent.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I am so relieved.[sr]If her scheme had succeeded...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
There would have been a sumptuous feast that would have been sure to destroy any sense of decency in Chaldea, and this summer “event” would have devolved into something unfit for any to witness.

Sure, I may never have found out what the teachings of the Buddha were, nor ever saw much sign of the gods' protection outside of battle!

I am so glad to see you smiling as well, venerable monk. You have reformed admirably.

As summer isn't over, our work is not complete. In time, autumn will come, and everyone will regain their senses.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
But until that happens, our battle as prefects to defend[sr]public decency will continue. However...[charaFace A 7]
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Sanzang
“However”?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
The fact that we have participated in the foreign goddess's competition from start to finish means that we shadow prefects have just completed a long stint of work.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
And what comes after work?
[k]

＠Sanzang
Umm...[sr]Let me think...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Sanzang
Oh, I've got it! A break!
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Exactly. I knew you would understand, venerable monk.[sr]That is why I must now take a summer break.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Naturally, summer is very hot. In order to endure the heat, one must take care to dress lightly.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
And when it comes to dressing lightly...in this day and age, we have swimsuits like this.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
This one is very functional and... Perhaps “healthy” is the best way to describe it? It's very easy to move around in, as there's nothing to get in your way.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
It is truly a wonderful thing: perfect for a break. In fact, I should show Master and Kintoki how nice it is!
