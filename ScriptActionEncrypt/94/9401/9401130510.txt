＠Okita
We did it, Master! It's been a while,[sr]but this is a great victory for me!
[k]

＠Okita
The Oda Bakufu is nothing more than a withering blossom that will bear no fruit. A weed!
[k]

＠Okita
But, thanks to Master collecting so much for our war coffers, the Shinsengumi has reached new heights of wealth and power!
[k]

＠Okita
I...um, well, I'm kinda embarrassed to say that the Shinsengumi was never exactly financially stable.[sr]So this is like a dream come true!
[k]

？1：Hm, I think I ate too many apples.
？2：I feel bad for Nobbu...

＠Okita
Oh, Mr. Hijikata, what do you think?[sr]What do you think of my Master?
[k]

＠Okita
As you can see, Master is a...um...master of collecting funds, and we're not so great at it. Why not let [&him:her][sr]officially join as a member?
[k]

＠Hijikata
Hmph. I'm not so sure about that. Hey, you. I don't mind a little fundraising, but report to me about it first!
[k]


＠Hijikata
If you don't, then...

＠Okita
This isn't the Shinsengumi... It's like the Shinsen-pair!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Okita
What do you think, Master? Only the First Unit has a captain, so there are a lot of open positions! You can't pass this opportunity up!
[k]

？1：I-I think I'd rather join as a trial member...

[charaFace B 4]

＠Okita
Oh...I see... Well, I can't force you.[wt 0.3][charaFace C 0][sr]I will arrange it so that you join for a trial period.
[k]

？2：Your meal plan isn't exactly a selling point...

[charaFace B 4]

＠Okita
I'm sorry. Rice with hot water and pickles is Mr. Hijikata's favorite, so he's got barrels and barrels of it! An entire storehouse, in fact!
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Okita
P-please bear with us for another...six months or so! That's when it'll all run out!

？！

＠Okita
All right. I'm curious as to what Nobbu is doing right now, so shall we go on patrol, Master?
