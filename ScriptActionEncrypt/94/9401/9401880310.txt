I saw a star streak across the sky. A shooting star with a trail of gleaming silk threads in its wake...
[k]

＠
It was the gleam of Venus, shining so bright that it was even visible from the deepest reaches of the underworld.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Girl
...Then again, I don't have time to bother with silly nonsense like that.
[k]

＠Girl
There's so much to do now that I've been left in charge of the underworld. I need to till fields, build houses, level mountains...
[k]

＠Girl
I'll do everything I can to make this land into the best nation ever! I can't wait to get started!
[k]

＠Girl
There's bound to be other gods stopping by here soon, so I need to make sure they'll be comfortable here!

When I awoke to my Divinity, which world I would rule had already been determined for me.
[k]

＠
The world below the surface... A freezing, untamed wilderness where the souls of the dead roamed free.[sr]A lifeless world bordering the abyss itself.
[k]

＠
No sun shines here. No stars twinkle, no wind blows, no water flows, and no flowers bloom. The underworld is only frigid cold, and now it is my task to care for this place.
[k]

That is the role[line 2]the only role[line 2]given to me.

＠Girl
Now what do I do...? I've been at this for a thousand years, and I haven't had a single person come to help!
[k]

＠Girl
This is impossible. I can't possibly warm up a freezing world like this all on my own!
[k]

＠Girl
They said I could ask the Anunnaki deities for help,[sr]but they all lost their Divinity ages ago!
[k]

＠Girl
The seven judgment pillars are basically nothing more than automatic law-reading lumps of clay!
[k]

＠Girl
The underworld's seven gates don't do a single thing unless I tell them to!
[k]

＠Girl
And there are new souls coming every day![sr]It's all I can do to build houses for them!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Girl
I haven't even had time to start building my own temple... (Sigh)
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Girl
Some cold-blooded goddess feared by all the other gods I turned out to be...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Girl
...No, I shouldn't say that. Sitting on the top of the underworld's mountain whining about this isn't going to help anything.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Girl
This world is still new, and they say there's more people on the surface every day!
[k]

＠Girl
At least I have plenty of books to read here, so I'll just keep studying until I find what I'm looking for.
[k]

＠Girl
Somewhere out there, there's got to be crops that grow without sunlight and water...
[k]

＠Girl
...livestock that doesn't need grass, and buildings that can safely, comfortably house disembodied souls.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Girl
Every living thing ends up here eventually.[sr]It's the last world most souls will ever see.
[k]

[charaFace A 16]

＠Girl
Being in charge of this land is an incredibly important job. S-so what if I haven't accomplished much over the last thousand years?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Girl
Just you wait. I don't care if it takes another ten thousand years, I'm not gonna give up. This place may not be as pretty as the surface, but...
[k]

＠Girl
No, on second thought, not having any stars shining down here means I can make this into a land fairer, more equal, and more beautiful than any other nation. And that's just what I'm going to do.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Girl
That's the whole reason why I awakened as an earth goddess. Bringing order to the underworld is my entire reason for being.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Girl
Which is why...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Girl
...I don't have any desire to fly across the sky,[sr]or even to leave this subterranean world.
[k]

＠Girl
And I refuse to tolerate the use of power for one's own benefit, or for humans, the way Ishtar did.
[k]

＠Girl
And so I vow that I will only ever use my Authority for the benefit of the underworld.
[k]

＠Girl
Thanks to the power of that oath,[sr]not even the other gods can defy me here.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Girl
...That's right. This is how it should be. I don't want anything for myself. That's my oath; it is the source of my power.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Girl
...Honestly, part of me wishes I hadn't gone that far. I wish that I'd made an oath that was a bit easier on me.
[k]

＠Girl
If I break the oath, I might end up losing all my power and become a Gallû Spirit...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Girl
Then again, why should I worry? It's not as if I would ever break my oath, you know!
[k]

＠Girl
The only things I care about are the underworld and making sure souls can rest in peace! Maaaybe I have my reservations if I'm being honest, but still!
[k]

＠Girl
But anyway, from now on, I'll never use my power for any one person in particular!
[k]

＠Girl
And forget about free protection! As if you guys have any idea how lonely it gets down here!
[k]

＠Girl
I'll never just help you humans on the surface out! So there!
[k]

＠Girl
If I do, I'll just explode right there on the spot!

I see. I suppose you might have blacked out, or redded out, if you had been flying on a fast sheep.

＠Altera Santa
But fortunately, you are in a gentle free fall. I suppose that, along with the sight of these sheep before you, would be enough to send anyone off to sleep.

The underworld is so strange. Not only is the bottom too deep to see, but it's impossible to figure out our altitude here.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I suppose it'll reset when we enter the next layer.[sr]Or perhaps altitude is not even a concept here...
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I get the feeling that the only sense of height here is based on something's level of importance.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
The gates must be so high up because of how important they are.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Even if it were in the middle of an otherwise level field, a gate would be about five hundred meters higher up, I think.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
We can probably apply that methodology to lifeforms as well.

Scammed? N-no... He wouldn't...[sr]Well...I haven't seen him since we got here...

But... But he had such a wonderful name...[sr]No creature with a name like that could be bad...

I think Doomzy must have vanished after entrusting his Santa powers to me. What a good sheep.

＠Altera Santa
I am here to deliver these presents in accordance with his wishes. You are headed to the bottom of the underworld to save Chaldea.

＠Altera Santa
We may have different goals, Fluffy Master,[sr]but our destination is the same. Yes.

＠Altera Santa
All right, prepare to land.[sr]I can see the second gate now.

Christmas is an event. It's all about the PRESENTS.

＠Shadow Santa
The value of goods changes every year. All they need is someone to give 'em, and someone to get 'em.

The present's genuine worth is secondary at best.[sr]Not that anyone these days seems to remember that.
