Here! You'll take your payment in small-denomination QP and like it!

＠Ibaraki-douji
Feel free to count it to make sure it all adds up if you like. I know your fighting spirit will never let you do otherwise. Kehehe...

＠Ibaraki-douji
Go ahead and count them one by one. But don't you dare stop cooking in the meantime! Now, I think I'll take a shish kebab next!

Isn't it strange that I've really been doing nothing but standing here this entire time?

I mean, I'm more than just an ungodly sexy swimsuit model, you know?

[charaFace D 2]

＠Elisabeth
The way I saw it, the higher-ups for this event were supposed to notice the pop star power I couldn't keep covered up 'cause it's just way too strong.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
Then they were supposed to beg me to take over the main role thanks to my incredible cuteness and popularity.
[k]

＠Elisabeth
Heads were supposed to roll for having overlooked such an amazing talent right under their noses all this time, and my future as a superstar should have been secured!

That's right. The only thing that stands between our racers and victory now is a single straightaway!
[k]

[charaFace H 6]

＠Ishtar Commentary
This area may have been improvised on the fly after the bridge collapsed, but hey, it works to keep things going!
[k]


＠Ishtar Commentary
I've tallied up the time it took each team to escape from the prison, and set up a new starting grid accordingly.
[k]


＠Ishtar Commentary
This time, each team will burn rubber as soon as we say go! It'll be a battle of fate, where each racer will have no choice but to trust in their luck.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]

＠Ishtar Commentary
There'll be no interference from enemies, and no tricky corners. All each team's gotta do is floor it and make for the finish line straight ahead!
[k]

＠Ishtar Commentary
A final leg for the ages, free of cheap tricks, where the winner will be obvious to anyone watching!
[k]

[charaFace H 7]

＠Ishtar Commentary
And we'll get to see how it all shakes out after a word from our sponsors!

[charaFace H 6]

＠Ishtar Commentary
It's been one hell of a long race, folks, but at last, it's time to separate the winners from the losers!

＠Ishtar Commentary
Listen up, all of you waiting on the starting grid! Look back on everything that's happened during this race.
