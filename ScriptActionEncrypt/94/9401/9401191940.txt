＠
I gave up being one of the 72 pillars and became, simply, Zepar: a single Demon God.
[k]

＠
I didn't know where the other three pillars went, nor did I care.
[k]

＠
I harbored no hatred for humanity.[sr]On the contrary, I had high hopes for its potential.
[k]

＠
I made managing humans as sources of information my new life's work.
[k]

[messageOff]
[scene 41500 1.0]
[wait scene]

＠
And I chose Seraphix as my base of operations.
[k]

＠
Flauros had previously reported that this facility was one of the causes of the “unobservable region.”
[k]

＠
I chose one of the humans from the church to be my host. It was an emergency measure I had to take until I could heal from the wounds I suffered at the Temple of Time.
[k]

＠
My work would take several decades to complete.
[k]

＠
During that time, I came to the conclusion that a human host was the best way to avoid Chaldea's detection. I was so sure of it.
[k]

＠
The name of the human I possessed was Sessyoin Kiara. She was a therapist who lent people her ear and helped to solve their problems.
[k]

＠
She was an absolute saint.[sr]Worthy enough to be the vessel of a savior, even.
[k]

＠
She was persecuted because her innate kindness was thought to be “inconvenient” in the human world.
[k]

＠
I can say this much, even now: if not for an outside influence like me, Kiara would be living a modest but happy life.
[k]

＠
She would have been respected among the members of a small community until the end of her days.
[k]

＠
...She may have been kind, but that is not a quality I had need of, so I buried it in the depths of her subconscious.
[k]

＠
I acted while she was asleep and attempted to recover my strength over time.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Remarkable... Quantifying emotions to soothe the hearts of those suffering from inner turmoil...
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
What a brilliant idea, Zepar.[sr]You may use my body as you wish.
[k]

[messageOff]
[scene 41100 1.0]
[wait scene]

＠
Kiara offered no resistance in handing her body over to me. I truly felt that her devotion, passion, and respect for me were genuine.
[k]

＠
I (as a Demon God, no less!) felt good about the situation and used Kiara's intelligence and social standing to effectively control the oil rig.
[k]

＠
Kiara's body proved to be an exceptional tool in my dealings with the opposite sex.
[k]

＠
No matter who they were or what they did, none resisted the temptation it offered.
[k]

＠
I learned much about human pleasure during that time.
[k]

＠
Of course, I truly would have been better off not knowing. Demon Gods have no need for pleasure.
[k]

＠
For a spiritual being like myself, the pleasures of the flesh proved to be too much, and I found myself increasingly unable to escape their allure.
[k]

＠
Human niceties, the stimuli that come from relationships, even pleasures that incorporate spirituality... Before I knew it, I was begging Kiara to help me understand.
[k]

＠
Though completely obedient, it was Kiara who was controlling my actions before long.
[k]

＠
How might I best make researchers capitulate?[sr]Or increase my authority even further?
[k]

＠
Her desire and ability to take action astonished me.
[k]

＠
The sheer ugliness within her was worthy of a Demon God.
[k]

[messageOff]
[scene 41300 1.0]
[wait scene]

＠
Indeed, it was I who converted Seraphix into SE.RA.PH.[sr]But the changes that followed exceeded all expectations.
[k]

＠
Kiara helped and healed the Seraphix personnel that had been thrown into chaos.
[k]


＠
She engineered a situation in which she was absolutely indispensable.
[k]

＠
After that, she cut each of them off from their group, one after the other.
[k]

＠
There was no rhyme or reason to who was chosen.
[k]

＠
Engulfed by the crisis, overwhelming fear twisted the personalities of the staff, made them depraved, stripped them of every last shred of humanity.
[k]

＠
One man killed his wife, fearing Kiara would abandon him... Another, a woman, was killed by the others after she plotted to kill Kiara...
[k]

＠
There was a woman who was killed simply because she saw Kiara looking sad. There was one man who desperately wanted to escape Kiara's grasp but was unable to do so.
[k]

＠
...I simply wanted a place to hide. I had no wish to see the world before me transformed into hell.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Heehee. What are you saying, Zepar? The plan was always to have more and more fun, was it not?
[k]

[messageOff]
[scene 41200 1.0]
[wait scene]

＠
It was then that Kiara seduced the personnel into opening up the planetarium to her. They opened Pandora's box of their own volition.
[k]
＠
BB and 128 Servants appeared on SE.RA.PH.
[k]

＠
Claiming she did it for my sake, Kiara took control and ruled SE.RA.PH from behind the scenes.
[k]

＠
By then, I had already lost control of her body.[sr]I could do nothing to stop her.
[k]

＠
It was now I who was possessed.
[k]

＠
Much as I had intended to possess her, she proved herself my superior in that regard.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
...I see. So each of the four escaped pillars intend to create a Singularity of their own...
[k]

＠
Each of us had our own goals, and we all found that in order to achieve them, we needed to create Singularities.
[k]

＠
When I told her that, her lips bent into a sympathetic smile of refusal.
[k]

＠
I could only ask why.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Mmm, why create a Singularity when it would feel so much better to BECOME one instead?
[k]

[messageOff]
[scene 10000 1.0]
[wait scene]

＠
That was the moment I realized I had underestimated human desire, that it had gone beyond all control.
[k]

＠
But it was too late. I tried to separate myself from Kiara, but I had no influence over her whatsoever. I had not the slightest bit of freedom to speak of.
[k]

＠
I desperately wanted to leave.[sr]I begged to leave.
[k]

＠
To my shame, I would have done anything to be free.[sr]I even offered to find her a new victim in my place.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
How could you say such a thing, Zepar?[sr]We share the same fate, the same ideals.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Or perhaps...you're dissatisfied with me somehow?
[k]

＠
I still remember the pang of terror I felt when she asked me that.
[k]

＠
...Forgive me. Please, let me go.
[k]

＠
I am taken over each and every day. I am helping to create a demon, and there's no stopping it. No turning back.
[k]

[messageOff]
[scene 41500 1.0]
[wait scene]

＠
I no longer had access to the diary I'd hidden in the chapel.
[k]

＠
All that I was permitted, the only place I was granted, was in the tip of Kiara's pinky finger.
[k]

＠
Shaking off the fear, I continued to beg and plead:[sr]“Free me.” “Let me go.”
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Nonsense, Zepar. Your pleas upset me.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
You were mistaken to think that my pinky finger was yours to reside in. That it was the only place for you.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
There's no place for you inside me anymore.[sr]I gave you that only as a courtesy.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_54 0.7]
＠Sessyoin Kiara
All that remains of you is your consciousness, and that only because I allow it.

＠
I lost my mind.
[k]

＠
As madness overtook me, one last thought came to me.
[k]

＠
This woman stole everything I had ever been. What little is left of me would fade away if I were to leave her.
[k]

＠
What is worse? To be enslaved by a human?[sr]Or to die proudly as a Demon God?
[k]

＠
It was a difficult decision, but in the end I chose the former.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
We are like friends, you and I.
[k]

＠
She beamed. Her smile, dripping with love, disgusted even me.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
But if that's truly what you desired, I guess I have no choice but to let you go.
[k]

＠
No, don't! No, no, no! Stop![sr]Your pinky is more than enough for me!
[k]

＠
Please don't abandon me! My goals, my will and my reason for being... Please don't take them away from me!
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
You'll be fine, Zepar. As long as we have our pleasure, you will be fine.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
Your goal is humanity's salvation, apparently so is mine.
[k]

＠Sessyoin Kiara
So leave everything to me and return to the place from which you came.
