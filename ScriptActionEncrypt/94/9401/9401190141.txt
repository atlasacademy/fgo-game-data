Hup[se ad171]...![sr]I say, you're quite skilled, milady!

However, I cannot imagine whose Heroic Spirit you may be...! In fact, I find it hard to believe you are a Heroic Spirit at all!

I, Gawain, am one of the three Servants who accompanied you here.

Surely you recall that I came to protect you along with an Archer and, ah, whatever you might call that other thing?

...Hmm. It would seem you are serious.[sr]I am not sure how this misunderstanding arose...
[k]

＠Gawain
But I can assure you that I am one of the Servants who accompanied you here from Chaldea, not one who was summoned by SE.RA.PH.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Gawain
Worry not, Master [%1]. It seems you've had a spot of difficulty since our arrival, but you may rest easy now that I am here to keep you safe.
[k]

＠Gawain
I too heard BB's speech.[sr]I have a fair idea of what is going on here.
[k]

＠Gawain
Let us resolve this situation and return to Chaldea together.

You came here with other Servants?[sr]THREE of them!?
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Meltryllis
You didn't say anything about that.[sr]I thought I was the only one here you could count on!
[k]

？1：Why are you so angry?
？2：Wait... You're angry at me?

？！

[charaFace A 9]
＠Meltryllis
I'm not angry. I'm just asking a question![sr]Now hurry up and tell me exactly what's going on here!

You have my thanks, Meltryllis.[sr]However...

[charaFace B 4]

(...The timing is far too convenient. An Alter Ego would have no reason to cooperate with Chaldea.)

＠Meltryllis
Hmm... An Archer with twin blades and a red coat, and a fox-eared Caster in a shrine maiden outfit...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

...Did you say an Archer in a red coat?

Not really. I just remember wanting to carve him up the moment I saw his face.

[charaFace A 4]
＠Meltryllis
At any rate, this means you have other assets at your disposal. ...Well, that's good to know.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
(...I can't afford to be picky right now.[sr]I'll never get another chance...)

[charaFace A 1]

So then, in addition to finding you a safe area, we also need to find your other Servants.

You can't trust her, right? I don't blame you.[sr]I mean, she's obviously hiding something.

Who can be trusted?[sr]Who's the real heroine?

Where could the other two Servants have gone!?
