[charaFace A 0]

＠Pārvatī
My memories and behavior are all Pārvatī,[sr]but expressed through her personality.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
We combined our good aspects and cut away the bad parts in a sort of mutual consensus, creating a new Pseudo-Servant.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
The girl's past and memories were sealed when we merged. After all, no human can bear the full weight of a god's mind and memories.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
But in exchange, my preferences and decision-making were all entrusted to her human nature.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]

＠Pārvatī
This may be hard to understand, but...let's see...[sr]Are you familiar with the concept of magical girls?
[k]

＠Pārvatī
I'm not too far off from that concept. It's a temporary state I can't change back from, but were I to do so, I would forget everything as soon as I did.

Hm. I figured we'd find a vessel once I knew we were dealing with a Divine Spirit, but this is a pretty far cry from what we saw in Uruk.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In that case, it was a goddess using a human as her core, but this seems to be a human using a goddess as her own core.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Either way, that girl must have some sort of connection with the Holy Grail and Servants.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Typically, the human the god's compatible with is just used as a vessel. The god puts a small part of their power into the vessel and kind of forces their way into that person to manifest as a Servant.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
At least, that's how it usually works for a Pseudo-Servant. You seem to be something of a special case, though.

But ultimately, you're not really much different from the other Divine Spirits in Chaldea.

I may not look cool, but I'm definitely really strong when I fight. Probably.

＠Pārvatī
If an enemy comes, I'll just slap, slap, slap them.[sr]Like this!
[k]

＠Pārvatī
I may borrow Shiva's power, but I still plan on doing it my way: by being splendid and graceful!
[k]

＠Pārvatī
Don't worry.[sr]I won't summon any weird shadows or anything!

Bingo. Pārvatī is usually described only as Shiva's wife...a goddess who is very mild-mannered...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But since she is Shiva's wife, Pārvatī is often identified with his OTHER wife, Durga, who is the goddess of battle...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And on top of that, she is also identified as Kali, who was born from the two gods. Long story short, if you get Pārvatī mad, she's terrifying!
