...Hmph. Digging a tunnel through the ground, eh.[sr]Sounds like a real pain.

＠Gorgon
Here I thought you were a bunch of annoying flies, but it turns out you're actually a bunch of grubs. I'm impressed you've made it this far without getting stepped on.

She's probably just too embarrassed to show her appreciation. She looks like a Servant whose Spirit Origin is made up of pure “tsun” to me.

I gotta say, throwing a bit of “dere” in the mix would do her some good.

We still have a lot of digging left to do, after all.

＠Nero
We have been fortunate up to this point,[sr]but there is one thing I have been concerned about.

What if we come up against a great boulder or other obstacle we couldn't clear away with our bare hands!?

Y'know, Monkey used to do the same thing all the time. “I'll build a castle in three days, boss!” “There's no way Shibata or anyone else could pull that off, boss!”

Well, the problem now is that there's only one of you, and six teams of us.

And we have our own reasons for why we can't all escape together.

Depending on how things could go, we could all end up fighting over who gets to use your acid.

Well, no matter. It's none of my concern.[sr]All you want is my acid, correct?

You should be able to carry that around in any container coated with my magical energy.

Let's give it a try.[sr]These cups should do the trick... Now then...

At any rate...I can't move from this cell.[sr]As you can see, I'm bound by divine steel chains.

But you are free to take my acid with you in those containers.
[k]

＠Gorgon
However, let me be clear about one thing.[sr]I cannot just make more on a whim.

Why is that, you ask? This may be hard for you to understand, but...producing it makes me extremely hungry.

Yes it is, my mechanical doll. No matter how badly you may want this acid, I can only produce so much.
[k]

＠Gorgon
So if you want it that badly, you'll need to bring me tribute every time you ask for more. Something that would fill my stomach would be best, of course.

In fact, I wouldn't mind if you offered up yourselves! Hahahahaha!
