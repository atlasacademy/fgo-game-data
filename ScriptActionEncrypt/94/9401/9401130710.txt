That's right. That place isn't a Singularity of a specific point in history, nor is it a time in history that's been altered.

It is just a single point in time that's unconnected to the past, and to the future.

I initially thought it was some parallel world's history that got derailed somewhere along the line.

But it's not. It's a world where time has stopped there, and ONLY there. If we think of human history as a narrative spanning thousands of volumes...
