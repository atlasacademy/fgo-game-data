SE.RA.PH has a two-layer structure.[sr]And I don't mean like a two-story building.

It's because baking it underneath also bakes it on the top. If it won't turn over on its own, you can use your paw instead.

Once you get to the rear side, just head to the same coordinates as the Command Room. Then, all you have to do is flip the body back over, and you'll be on the Chest.
