I took off my haori, picked up a gun, and just...fought.

＠Hijikata
But in the end, I was driven to the far north...and wound up like this.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Hijikata
Pathetic. This feeling makes my stomach churn with rage so much, it feels like it might even be able to bring me back to life.
[k]

＠Hijikata
I haven't failed my makoto, yet my body has failed me.[sr]And that is...infuriating.

[charaFace B 4]

...But not half as much as the fact that Okita,[sr]idiot that she is, defeated me...

Well, yeah...

[charaFace B 1]
＠Hijikata
The stupid girl, who sat on the veranda that day just staring absently up at the sky, acts like such a big shot now.
[k]

＠Hijikata
That's just how I remember her from Kondou's dojo... The girl we all laughed about because none of us ever thought we could beat her.

I'm glad I could see her like that again.[sr]Might as well steel myself and go[charaFace B 0]... Hm?

You're a Demon God Pillar, right? I would have expected you to try and drag me down with you. But...are you concerned about me?

＠Hijikata
If only I'd been more compatible with you, this world would've been better fortified and defended.
[k]

＠Demon God Andras
Correct. That's nothing more than a regret now, though. But thanks to you, I did learn one thing.
[k]

＠Demon God Andras
To die while lamenting the life that has been lost...
[k]

＠Demon God Andras
That was the one saving grace I[sr]received as I gained self-awareness.
[k]

＠Hijikata
...
[k]

＠Demon God Andras
But you are different.
[k]

＠Demon God Andras
I will disappear at the end of my drifting, while you will disappear at the end of your battle.
[k]

＠Demon God Andras
That is the fate that was engraved onto your Spirit Origin. And so, it is not yet time for you to die.
[k]

＠Demon God Andras
My beacon. My horizon. O Berserker soldier who witnessed the end of my drifting.
[k]

＠Demon God Andras
Keep fighting. Fight for the sake of your makoto,[sr]even though you know you cannot be saved.
[k]

＠Demon God Andras
This shall be your punishment for redeeming my evil, even for a brief moment, and my final wish made in this life.
