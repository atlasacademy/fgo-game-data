I can't tell whether these mass-produced Mecha Eli-chan Mk. IIs are idiots or just...very simple manifestations of evil, but they're certainly giving us plenty of time to plan our moves.

Hmm, we should think positively about this. The giant Mecha Eli-chan is being very intelligent about this.

＠Amazones CEO
It's extremely logical!
