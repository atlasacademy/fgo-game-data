I'm in charge here! Me!

The director, deputy director, department manager, and the medical staff... ALL of them died a long time ago! I made sure of that!

I need a way to force [%1] into line and get [&him:her] to follow my orders.
[k]

＠Arnold
But how...? If [&he:she] had a partner, I could've taken them hostage... But it looks like a solo mission.
[k]

＠Arnold
Maybe I could get some poison from the sick bay...?[sr]But that would mean returning alone to the Command Room...

Never mind! Perfect timing! I'm ordering you to get to the sick bay, ASAP. It's next to the Command Room.

That's all the Seraphix personnel dead. Killed in the line of duty. Now this Animusphere experiment will never be repeated.

...All that's left to destroy is the planetarium.

＠Emiya Alter
Their investigation into what's in there and what went on is none of my concern.

No...no, no, no. This Spirit Origin pattern...[sr]It can't be...!

[bgm BGM_EVENT_41 0.1]
＠???
Oh, you haven't forgotten me already, have you?
[k]

＠???
Or perhaps those memories were stripped away when you became a Heroic Spirit?
[k]

＠???
Once upon a time, a new cult grew to prominence. It made believers out of people everywhere. Scientists, politicians, those in power, people the world over.
[k]

＠???
It offered righteous salvation. A movement of people lacking a desire for profit, absent of political opinion. No thought or possession, you might say.
[k]

＠???
They were a movement of wounded souls and talented loners, all unable to find their own place in the world.
[k]

＠???
They had talent, and the genius to save the whole world. And yet...so much of that world viewed them with nothing more than suspicion.
[k]

＠???
There was nothing evil about the group, though. In fact, there was not an evil soul to be found among them.
[k]

＠???
Well...except, perhaps, for the woman who founded it...
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
You...! It's you!

You killed them. You killed everyone in that building to get to her.
[k]

＠???
Of course, they would not allow me to be murdered. Killing was the only way they could be sure not to lose me.
[k]

＠???
But...you crushed them all.[sr]You crushed them like ants.
[k]

＠???
And after all that, you even killed me.[sr]You did, didn't you? Kill me, I mean.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
...Oh I ended you all right.[sr]Your mortal life, at least...
[k]

＠???
That's right. But you couldn't kill my essence.[sr]Maybe if I'd existed in your world...
[k]

＠???
Yeees... I am sure I would have gladly leaped from that roof. Truly, though[line 2]if anything at all[line 2]I was bored.
[k]

＠???
You played at being an “ally of justice” but in truth...you were an absurd, insignificant little speck.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Ngh...!
[k]

[se ade50]

＠???
Now, now. I cannot have you running amok, can I? It would be so very, very easy to snap off each of your limbs...
[k]

＠???
There can be no question of you escaping.[sr]It would be futile to try.
[k]

＠???
You butchered innocent people.[sr]Oh, how that will haunt you for eternity.
[k]

＠???
Isn't that right? You hardly needed the help of a wicked woman like me to find your own way to hell.
[k]

＠???
You cannot forgive anything, cannot reconcile with any evil. And that puts you beyond all hope of salvation.
[k]

＠???
After all, human hearts are not made of steel, are they?
[k]

＠???
If nothing else, like the Saber I consumed here, you will reach enlightenment in death.
[k]

[seStop ade50 1.0]
＠???
And finally, the truth about the me of your world becomes clear...
[k]

＠???
...I see the reason why someone like you would go so far as to twist and pervert his own beliefs just to kill me.
[k]

＠???
...I'm afraid that it is only sensible now that I kill you. There is no other way.
[k]

＠???
It was you, and you alone, who sensed what the me of your world would eventually become...
