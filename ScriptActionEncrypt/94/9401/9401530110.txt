Of course not. Any driver worth her salt[sr]knows to wear her seatbelt at all times.

Still, I never expected my seatbelt to tear and then to be thrown from the vehicle. At least it seems the other teams are in a similar predicament.

What did she call it...the “reverse ravine drop” I believe? A secret method of descending cliffs on horseback. I believe she used it at Ichi-no-Tani...
