But it's true. According to legend,[sr]it actually was a hunk of cheese that killed Medb.
[k]

＠Mash
After Medb killed her sister, her nephew took it upon himself to avenge his mother.
[k]

＠Mash
One day, while she bathed, he launched a hunk of cheese at her with a sling, and it went right through her head...

Some hard cheeses CAN be tough as rocks... I'm not sure even my shield would be able to deflect them...

It wouldn't even matter how strong the Prison Field is, because while it may be able to neutralize attacks, it can't do anything about that sort of thing.

At any rate, let's say that we can kill Medb by bonking her on the head with some cheese.
[k]

＠Helena
She obviously knows what her weakness is,[sr]so she'll almost certainly be guarding against it.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]

＠Helena
In all the time we've been here,[sr]Medb has rarely shown herself to prisoners like us.
[k]

＠Helena
And when she does, she makes sure to surround herself with so many Celtic warriors who could block any airborne cheese projectiles or the like.

＠Gorgon
She usually seems to stick to the warden's office. It's the room on the top floor of the building that looks like a palace; you can see it from the courtyard.
[k]

＠Gorgon
I don't know how she spends most of her time. All I know is that she always takes a shower in her office at the same time every day.
[k]

＠Gorgon
Even if she's in the middle of whipping or riding prisoners in the courtyard, she'll always drop whatever she's doing to return to her office at that time.

...
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Helena
Of course, as prisoners, there's no way we could go to the warden's office ourselves. But we do have a decent number of chances to go out to the courtyard.
[k]

＠Helena
In which case...wouldn't it be possible to snipe her from there? Her bathroom must have at least one window, right?

It sounds interesting in theory, but I have my doubts about its practicality. In a situation like that, the single most important thing we would need is measurements.

The distance from the firing point to the target, the angle, the weight of the payload, and so on... Everything is ruled by numbers.

We have not been imprisoned here for very long. While it may be theoretically possible for us to acquire all the data we would need for such a shot on our own, we simply don't have enough time.
