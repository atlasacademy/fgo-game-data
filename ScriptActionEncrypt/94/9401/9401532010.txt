There we go! It's coming together nicely! And it's all thanks to you guys driving over my Venus textures!

＠Ishtar
The tire marks you all carved into this land while you were desperately trying to outrun one another functioned just like kind of magical summoning circle...
[k]

＠Ishtar
...and this little doohickey is designed to gather up all the magical energy expended during the race.
[k]

＠Ishtar
At the same time, the parts I had you install in your vehicles secretly stored the heat created by the friction of your magical-energy-propelled tires running across my textures...
[k]

＠Ishtar
...which in turn completed the preparations for the excited state for each part.

＠Ishtar
The Queen of Kur stole all the best parts for herself, even though I'm the Queen of Heaven.

＠Ishtar
The other goddesses all pitied me, calling me pathetic just because I lost my trump card, the Bull of Heaven...

Goldie would laugh at me and say things like “Well of course the Bull of Heaven left you! Who'd want a master that was built like a washboard!”...

It's been a long and humiliating road to get here,[sr]but at last...I've finally reached my goal!

You there! Don't you look at me like that! This is NOT just about taking out my frustrations on others!
[k]

[charaFace B 7]
＠Ishtar
Don't worry. Since I'm the highest class of goddess there is, I'll tell you what was really going on with this race.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Up till now, I would spend all my free time searching for Gugalanna, or trying to resummon him...anything I could think of to get him back, basically.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Considering how tight we were, it should've only been a matter of time until he came back to me.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Ishtar
...But no matter how hard I tried, he never came home.[sr]I couldn't find him anywhere. I couldn't summon him.[sr]I couldn't even sense his breathing.
[k]

I realized that I hadn't just lost him. Either he was taken someplace my Authority doesn't reach, or[line 2]

[charaFadein B 0.1 1]

Exactly. Which means it wasn't my fault that I lost Gugalanna in Uruk.
[k]

＠Ishtar
At that point, he had already become detached from me,[sr]so it was no wonder I wasn't able to summon him again.
[k]

＠Ishtar
Gugalanna had returned to heaven. It was a gift from my father, but he had earned his retirement. I had no problem with that. Really.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Ishtar
So I had a change of heart, and decided to take a different tack. If the first Gugalanna was broken, I could just make another!
