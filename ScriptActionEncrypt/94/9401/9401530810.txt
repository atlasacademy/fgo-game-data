Between the abnormalities in Connacht's land, the invisible attack dog, and prison guards who have disappeared, probably slacking off...

...Queen Medb certainly has more than her fair share of headaches.

After another hard day of problem-solving, it's time for the queen's regular shower. How wonderfully Celtic!
[k]

＠
What's more, today we have a very special treat: we've been authorized to show the queen's shower on the air. Well, not exactly authorized, I'm afraid.
[k]

＠
Here's what I mean.

Hm hm hmm♪

[scene 10000]
＠
This incredible spectacle alone should be a more than ample reward for any well-trained Connachtian. We are receiving reports of viewers fainting across the country, so please try to contain yourselves.
[k]

＠
Nonetheless, I can hardly blame you. Just the sound of the water hitting her body is almost too much. Oh, to be one of those lucky little droplets...
[k]

＠
How alluring, how beautiful, how utterly divine!
[k]

＠
It's as though the steam itself, as it dances around the shower, is hesitant to touch that perfect form.
[k]


＠Warden Medb
Teehee☆
[k]

＠
As the steam wafts shyly out the window, she turns toward it and smiles, as if to tell it has nothing to fear.
[k]

＠
...And don't worry, there are no tall buildings nearby that can see into this window, so she has nothing to fear from Peeping Toms.
[k]

＠
The only thing that could be so lucky as to catch[sr]sight of her would be a little bird flying by.
[k]

＠
And should that happen, the queen would surely smile and invite the tiny citizen to come and join her in song.
[k]

＠
Blue skies, shower steam, her smiling face... As long as we have these joyous sights to feast upon, the nation of Connacht will surely endure forever.
[k]

＠
Indeed, so long as our beloved queen lives, Connacht is assured to enjoy boundless prosperity for[line 2]

Oh my, what a surprise. The queen has performed a back-facing roundhouse! Such splendor. Such beauty! One might die of shock from viewing such perfection in motion!

＠Warden Medb
Hah! Did you really think that would work on me!?
[k]

＠Warden Medb
I don't know what sort of lowlife is responsible for this...but this is as good a chance as any to set the record straight.
[k]

＠Warden Medb
Yes, if a piece of cheese hits me, I will die. Just like how anyone else would die from getting hit by a rock!
[k]


＠Warden Medb
But that's ONLY if it manages to hit me.
[k]


＠Warden Medb
And unfortunately for you would-be assassins, I've trained my body to automatically react whenever cheese comes flying towards it!
[k]

＠Warden Medb
I am the queen of Connacht. I have a duty to lead this land to prosperity for a long, long time to come.
[k]

＠Warden Medb
There was no way I was going to let my weakness remain a weakness forever!
