Well done, [%1].

＠Gawain
I cannot tell what sort of battle took place in the instant it seemed to take...
[k]

＠Gawain
But I can tell you have succeeded in freeing that poor girl from her bonds. Truly, this is cause for celebration.

Hm? What was that, Lady Meltryllis?

＠Gawain
...I must say, things really are quite different here on SE.RA.PH. Ordinarily, a battle of such mild intensity would never cause me to become dizzy.

＠Gawain
As for Lady Lip, I shall attend to her. The poor thing...she must be exhausted, having been fighting all this time.
[k]

＠Gawain
I would like to bring her to the church and let her rest there. Is that all right with you, [%1]?
