＠Mecha Eli-chan
...Almost all of the disgrace looming over Castle Csejte is due to Elisabeth's conduct in her later years.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
She was a mad countess who bathed in the blood of her young female subjects in a horrendously misguided attempt to retain her youth.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
A foolish woman and ardent admirer of dubious witchcraft...
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
An inhuman monster who brought destruction upon herself by preying upon the nobility in consequence of her own blind faith...
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
...Such disgrace is well beyond redemption.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
She could have repented and become the greatest, most wonderful ruler of all time. But even that would not have been enough to atone for her horrific crimes.
[k]


＠Mecha Eli-chan
But not me. I may be a new iteration of[sr]Elisabeth Báthory, but she and I are our own people.

I am a better Elisabeth Báthory than Elisabeth could ever hope to be. I am the ideal Elisabeth Báthory that Elisabeth only wishes she could be!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
When she was alive, the real Elisabeth went mad from fear of losing her beauty, but I will neither age nor degrade.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
After all, I'm made of steel.[sr]Both my body and my mind will last forever.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
So rest assured, my faithful subjects.[sr]You no longer have anything to worry about.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
I declare here and now that I will unify Castle Csejte's patchwork structure, preserve its dignity...
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
...and become the guardian that the people of this land deserve. From this moment forward, you will all fear and respect me accordingly.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
I am your iron ruler. I am both compassionate and merciful, but I also have neither tears nor blood to shed.[sr]I am the Steel Demoness: Mecha Eli-chan!
