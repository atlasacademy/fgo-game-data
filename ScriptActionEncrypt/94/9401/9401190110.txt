＠Announcement
Welcome, visitors, to the Spiritron Virtual World: Serial Phantasm.
[k]

＠Announcement
Known as SE.RA.PH for short, this reborn pure land of pleasure is modeled after the digital world.
[k]

＠Announcement
128 Masters and Servants have come here in order to prevent the real world from being destroyed.
[k]

＠Announcement
While we have nothing but praise for this noble purpose...
[k]

＠Announcement
Human desires are insatiable, and our audience won't be satisfied with nobility alone.
[k]

＠Announcement
Thus, one more condition for victory has been added to SE.RA.PH:
[k]

＠Announcement
Kill all 127 other Masters.[sr]Be the last one standing.
[k]

＠Announcement
Once you are, you will be granted the Mooncell, a source of unfathomable power.
[k]

＠Announcement
But please do be careful.[sr]SE.RA.PH has no exit.
[k]

＠Announcement
And doing nothing is not an option.
[k]

＠Announcement
Whether you fight, or kill one another...you have no choice but to put your survival first.
[k]

Heh heh heh.[sr]Heh heh heh heh...!
[k]

＠BB
There you are, Senpai! Welcome to the For-Adults-Only trap! There's no going back now!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠BB
No wonder you conquered the Temple of Time![sr]I have to admit that you've got courage!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠BB
Of course, that's pretty much the only thing you've got going for you, so I don't expect you to stand out in any other way.
[k]

？1：What's going on here, BB!?


？2：Hey! What was that about 1GB!?

[charaFace A 10]
＠BB
Wait, that's what's bothering you?[sr]You're a lot pettier than your data indicated.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
But the fact remains that you just don't have much going on [&down there:up here], so you'll have to deal with it!
[k]

＠BB
Sorry! But hey, don't worry: it's not about the size, it's the shape that matters.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠BB
...Let's see. You're completely cut off from Chaldea, and you don't possess the skills of a wizard.
[k]

＠BB
Since you're so hopeless, I guess the helpful game master[line 2]that's me[line 2]will just have to do the work of explaining the rules to you.
[k]

＠BB
At the moment, there are a bunch of Servants butting heads with each other here in SE.RA.PH.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
And why not? This Holy Grail War is nothing but a battle to the death between all 128 of them![se ade76]
[k]


＠BB
And just like you, Senpai, they all came here like lambs to the slaughter.
[k]

＠BB
Maaaybe because I fooled them into thinking there was a teensy-weensy world-ending threat to contend with.
[k]

＠BB
Little did they know that this was really nothing more than a way for me to kill some time![se ade76]
[k]


？1：A 128-Servant battle to the death...

[charaFace A 6]
＠BB
That's right. It's a tacky little game I whipped up based on the Moon Holy Grail War.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
Of course, the Mooncell had a whole tournament thing going on, while this is just a straight-up down-and-dirty battle royale.
[k]


？2：Then you're the one behind all this!

[charaFace A 5]
＠BB
Well duh! Who do you think I am, anyway?
[k]

＠BB
I'm BB! The original fallen heroine, the “Oops, did I do that?” kouhai who ends up destroying the world!
[k]

＠BB
This time, to put it modestly, I actually went out of my way to make sure you all suffer!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠BB
Anyway... You really don't have anything going for you, do you, Senpai? Without any Servants around, it's almost sad how weak you are.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]
＠BB
So since even I can't help but feel a little sorry for you, I'll help you out just a little more.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠BB
Yes, this is Seraphix.
[k]

＠BB
Think of it as a zone made entirely out of light, where everything has been digitized into Pseudo-Spiritrons.
[k]

＠BB
As long as intellectual activity is taking place here, an information life-form like myself and an organic life-form like you can interact in the same space-time.
[k]

＠BB
Furthermore, knowledge, experience, and power sources you attain here will be carried over when you return to the physical world.
[k]

＠BB
So any battle you engage in here on SE.RA.PH has the same significance that it would in real life, and things that happen here can and do affect reality.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]
＠BB
What's that? How did this happen?[sr]You mean, why did Seraphix end up digitized?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
You'll have to figure that out for yourself, Senpai.[sr]It wouldn't be fair to the others if I told you.
[k]

＠BB
Now, this is where Seraphix's front gate used to be. It's the entrance that all the regular staff used when commuting here from the company dormitory.
[k]

＠BB
Makes the perfect place for you to start your SE.RA.PH expedition, if I do say so myself. Don't you think?
[k]

？1：This is...the front gate?

[charaFace A 6]
＠BB
Yup. It had to be rebuilt after the digitization destroyed it.
[k]

？2：Um, that map looks kind of...feminine.

[charaFace A 5]
＠BB
Just ignore that.[sr]Even I find it embarrassing.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠BB
Still, once I took over the system, it was inevitable that the oil rig would assimilate with my consciousness.
[k]

＠BB
Doesn't really take a genius to figure out what shape it would take when it was reformatted during the digitization, does it?
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
Anyway, now that you're here, Senpai, there's no quitting or running away!
[k]

＠BB
Your only choice is to scuttle along SE.RA.PH like an ant carrying a sugar cube.
[k]

＠BB
And if you don't like that idea, you'll have to unravel the whole mystery of what's happening here toot sweet!
[k]

＠BB
Once you do that, you'll finally be free of the ant life![sr]Oh, but that said...
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠BB
Time isn't exactly on your side here, you know?
[k]

＠BB
Once SE.RA.PH sinks to the bottom of the trench, everyone dies. Even I can't change that.
[k]

＠BB
So you'll have to fulfill the victory conditions and make it back alive. Assuming you stupid humans are capable of that, of course.

＠???
It's sad how you were about to be killed with no means of defending yourself, and it's sad how you preyed on a helpless beginner.
[k]

＠???
This may be a barbaric slaughterfest, but it is precisely times like this when one must conduct oneself elegantly. Otherwise, you'll lose your audience.
[k]

＠???
The victor who triumphs over every obstacle must act with all due decorum.
[k]

＠???
But what decorum is there to be found in killing a Master who has yet to even properly take the stage?
[k]

Isn't that right, Suzuka? You don't deserve such fine brocade if this is how you choose to act.

Very well then, since we aren't complete strangers,[sr]I suppose I can answer your question.

＠???
Why did I help this human?[sr]Why am I here in the first place?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠???
Do you even need to ask? I'm a prima ballerina who follows her heart wherever it takes her. I never forget when someone has humiliated me.
[k]

＠???
So I have quite literally flown back up from the bowels of the earth for a chance to fight you all once more.
[k]

[k]

[charaFace C 1]

Hmm. I really only helped you on a whim, but I see you don't have any Servants, do you?
[k]

＠???
That works out well. Very well, in fact. You see, I've been looking for a puppet[line 2]ahem, a Master[line 2]of my own.
[k]

＠???
So I'll help rescue you from her, if you form a contract with me. And you really should.
[k]

＠???
After all, it is either that, or die here.
[k]

＠???
...Well? You don't have much time.[sr]Listen up, because I'm only going to say this once:

[charaFace C 1]

I'm Meltryllis, the Alter Ego of pleasure.[sr]I'll serve as your sword for as long as I feel like it.
