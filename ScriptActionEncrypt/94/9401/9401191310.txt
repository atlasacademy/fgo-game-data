...Looks like this place corresponds to the location of the front gate on the other side. What was this facility used for, Meltryllis?

Another gate, of course.[sr]But one that was reserved for special employees.
[k]

？1：Special employees...?

[charaFace B 6]
＠Meltryllis
Yes. Remember how I said the entrance on the front side was for regular employees?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Well, this one was to keep those well-intentioned regular employees out of secret areas.

Good instincts, [%1].[sr]I was thinking the same thing.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
My guess is this gate was solely for employees who reported directly to Chaldea.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
No, wait... Everyone at Seraphix worked directly for Chaldea. In which case...
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
The only people who could enter this facility would have to be people directly under its owners...the Animusphere family.

Hmm... This Cat smells secrets! Honestly, what difference does having a pedigree certificate make anyway... What could it possibly tell you about your cat...

At any rate: Master, my sensitive cat ears have been picking up an alert sound for a while now.

“Present your pass now. Failure to do so within five seconds will result in immediate termination.”

It's worse than that. They meant “terminate” in a very literal sense! Get ready, [%1]!
