＠Pārvatī
I am an Indian goddess, while you are from the Greek pantheon. Bluntly put, we have nothing in common.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Medusa
That is...true...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Pārvatī
Yet that doesn't seem to matter to you,[sr]and you are fighting fiercely to stop me.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
It is hard to believe you're doing this just because we are both goddesses.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
Then, the answer is quite clear.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Pārvatī
You are concerned not about the goddess I am,[sr]but the girl whose body I inhabit.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Medusa
...Nnngh...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Medusa
That...is a valid point...[sr]I simply felt that you should not be fighting...
[k]

[charaFace C 3]

＠Medusa
...
[k]

＠Medusa
Yes, you may be right.[sr]The girl and I do have some sort of connection.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Pārvatī
The reason why you feel I should not fight is because you are concerned for her becoming a container for a Divine Spirit.

＠Pārvatī
Oh, but don't get me wrong.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Pārvatī
I'm not quite sure why, but something within me compelled me to refer to you that way, by the name of your Class.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
But I have absolutely no memory of you.[sr]After all, I am Pārvatī right now. However...
[k]

＠Pārvatī
Neither I, nor this body of mine, feel any anger towards you for what you've done here. In truth, we are happy about it.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Medusa
So...you don't intend to stop the manifestation?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Pārvatī
No. This is a part of my duty.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
I have been entrusted with a mission. I must deal with my own mess. Well, it's my own fault for making a certain sacrifice...
[k]

＠Pārvatī
No matter the path I take, I'm certain it will lead me to save the world as a goddess.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
Even if it means I must sacrifice my life,[sr]I will protect the world and the people that I love.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Pārvatī
And the girl shared my wish to be such a being.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
It is the wish we share that allowed me to manifest here. At least that's what I believe.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
Surely you must know that the girl possesses a strong heart.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Medusa
Yes...you're right.
[k]

＠Medusa
If your existence here is a result of her resolve...
[k]

＠Medusa
All I did was get in her way and overstepped my boundaries in doing so.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]

＠Pārvatī
You didn't overstep anything. As I said, the thought behind your actions made us happy. Truly.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Pārvatī
But...there are things that even we cannot give up.[sr]That is all I wanted to say.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Medusa
...Ah, you are absolutely right.
[k]

＠Medusa
She may look weak and cowardly...but she really was strong-willed.
[k]

＠Medusa
I had forgotten that you were that kind of person.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Medusa
Please, allow me to apologize for my actions. And these clothes... Here, I will return them to their rightful owner.

[k]

＠Pārvatī
Those who have only seen you wearing this uniform might think a goddess assaulted you and stole your clothes.

[charaFace A 0]

＠Pārvatī
It might be best to consider making a duplicate of the uniform just for you.

You must vow to not treat her like a disposable pawn or put her in unnecessarily dangerous situations.

＠Medusa
I'm not asking for you to give her special treatment.

＠Medusa
I'm only saying that you should treat her as well as the rest of your Servants, and take good care of her. Understood?

And not just to Medusa...

But perhaps many others in Chaldea would feel the same way when they see her.

？1：That's concerning.

＠Mash
It'll be okay. As long as Master's around, any complicated relationships between the Servants are sure to be resolved quickly!

＠Mash
And of course, I will do my very best to support you!

That's the spirit, Master![sr]I hope to one day have an outlook as positive as yours!

Either way, our quest here is done now.[sr]Good work!
