King of Uruk, can you tell me more about Ereshkigal?
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I know that she's the goddess of the underworld,[sr]but I don't know anything else about her.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I did hear something about how she was assigned to the underworld from the time she was born, which is why she wields immense power there...
[k]

＠Altera Santa
...but exactly what sort of Authority does she possess?

＠Gilgamesh
An excellent question, Santa.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Ereshkigal is the twin sister of Ishtar,[sr]the greediest goddess of all time.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
And just like her sister, Ereshkigal possessed the capacity that let her attain all manner of Authority.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Gilgamesh
But, unlike her sister, Ereshkigal never allowed herself to indulge in her own personal desires.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
She was diligent, industrious, genuinely considerate, and responsible to a fault. She was cold and proud, yet for some reason, she thought poorly of herself.

[charaTalk A]

＠Gilgamesh
Of course it is. She puts on a proud, blustering front, never showing any sign of weakness, as befits her role of ruler of the underworld.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
But she is constantly berating herself internally. She is a classic example of the sort who works hard to overcome her lack of faith in her own abilities.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Ishtar may be a cross between a horde of locusts, a sandstorm, and a toddler's tantrum...
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Ereshkigal, though, somehow possesses the diligence of a honeybee, the temperament of a storm cloud, and the innocence of a child, all at the same time.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Not one other Sumerian god has an ounce of self-control. Ereshkigal, though...she was serious to a fault.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Her innate earnestness made her well[sr]suited to rule the underworld.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Gilgamesh
Well, at times she did acquire Authority beyond her own, but only from the other gods' foolishness.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Which brings me to one of these other gods:[sr]Nergal, a god of the underworld.

Nergal is now known for ruling the underworld at Ereshkigal's side. However, his original domain was actually the sun.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
In the world of Sumer, the sun was viewed as a blessing, but it was also treated as something dangerous that claimed the lives of many people.

The underworld is no more than a coffin filled with writhing grubs. It should be closed down immediately, and a thrilling Sunnyland built in its place!

These defamatory statements of his stemmed in part from his desire to take revenge on Ishtar, who ruled the heavens as she saw fit.

＠Gilgamesh
Most likely, he was attempting to lay claim to the heavens for himself by disgracing Ishtar's sister.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Naturally, the humans turned a deaf ear to his wild boasts, but so too did the gods, for Nergal was indeed formidable.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
As for Ereshkigal... Well, everyone expected her to cry herself to sleep, but she surprised them all.

Much to everyone's surprise, Ereshkigal confronted Nergal by way of a letter sent from the underworld.
