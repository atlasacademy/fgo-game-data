Self-sacrifice is indeed a noble thing to do.[sr]It's much like Davy Crockett at the Alamo.

She has awoken from her dream.[sr]Bunyan can never return to her endless loop.

＠Goddess Columbia
Cooperate with me. Seize Bunyan's Grail, and destroy it before she is given status as a Heroic Spirit in the Throne of Heroes.
[k]

＠Goddess Columbia
She is merely a being from folklore unworthy to be a Heroic Spirit. Destroying her should be possible.
