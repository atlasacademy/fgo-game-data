Um, testing, testing! Can you hear me okay?[sr]You can? Great.

＠BB
So sorry to have kept you waiting. This announcement is for everyone left alive on SE.RA.PH.
[k]

＠BB
Thank you so much for all time you've put into killing, hating, and encouraging each other.
[k]

＠BB
I wish I could say it's been fun, but all...mediocre things must come to an end. Seraphix will soon reach its final destination at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.
[k]

＠BB
In other words...game over![sr]This Holy Grail War has ended! Thanks for playing!
[k]

＠BB
But unfortunately, nobody emerged victorious this time, either. Only three survivors makes the game null and void.
[k]

＠BB
As such, that makes me, the sponsor, the game's winner. This is where we part ways.
[k]

＠BB
Final result: humans defeated.[sr]Winner: Demon God Zepar.
[k]

＠BB
So that's that! Before long, SE.RA.PH will emerge, and you will all be consumed.
[k]

＠BB
But making the game impossible was pretty unfair, don't you think? That's why I'm here with a special offer!
[k]

＠BB
Available for a limited time only![sr]The chance to fight yours truly... BB!
[k]

＠BB
Any comments, questions, protests, complaints, or requests should be brought to the attention of the sponsor who awaits at the Core♡
[k]

＠BB
As the game master that has carried you this far,[sr]I decided to make the ending especially fun for you![se ade77]

Meltryllis and Lip are Alter Egos, so they don't count.

Hehehe. He was basically BB's pawn.[sr]I don't think he counts as a participant.

He's always giving me a hard time, I'd love to give him a taste of his own medicine!

...I am worried for the safety of Arnold and Mable, but we are very short on time.
[k]

＠Tristan
Reluctant as I am to accept BB's invitation, we should hurry to the Core[line 2]the planetarium.
[k]

？1：I agree.
？2：This has gone on long enough.

...Would you object to us leaving you here in the church, Meltryllis? You are not in any condition to fight.

Besides, we can't fight BB. In fact, there's not much reason for Lip to accompany you, either.

But now it's not just us.[sr]There has to be a way out.

＠Meltryllis
...Which is why...Suzuka, Tamamo, Tristan, I implore you: give [%1] a chance to fight back.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
You are not Alter Egos. That devil shouldn't be able to consume full-fledged Servants like you.
