Greek mythological heroes such as Heracles and the witch Medea... Karna and Arjuna from Indian mythology...
[k]

＠Holmes
Celtic heroes, the knights from the Legend of King Arthur, Charlemagne's famous paladins, the giant-killing Beowulf...
[k]

＠Holmes
The four retainers of Raikou who slayed the demon spider Tsuchigumo... Many myths and legends spoke of these heroes and great men and women...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Holmes
Let us say for the moment that I am indeed a creation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. What, then, is to say that the individuals I mentioned are not similar creations?
[k]

＠Holmes
I was created during the time when Doyle wrote his stories, but many heroes of legend were created by people writing stories long after their respective moments in time.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Holmes
For example, Siegfried's story found in the Poetic Edda, while set in the 5th century, was not completed until after the 8th century.
[k]

＠Holmes
Karna and Arjuna's story is set somewhere around 5000 B.C. The text itself, however, was completed sometime between the 4th century B.C. and the 4th century A.D.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Holmes
Even the legend of Sakata Kintoki, Mister Golden himself, was said to be set down in narrative form sometime after the Edo period.
[k]

＠Holmes
Other than him, the majority of the heroic tales of Japan's Heian period were passed on in stories told during the early days of the Edo period.
[k]

？1：So these heroes existed long ago...
？2：...Their legends were told long after they lived.

？！

[charaFace A 6]
＠Holmes
Ah, indeed. That is probably true.[sr]So what of me?
[k]

？1：Oh, I get it.

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Holmes
Ah, you understand now?
[k]

＠Holmes
What difference is there between these heroes of legend and myself? None. We are essentially the same.
[k]

？1：But there isn't proof that you really existed...

？！

＠Holmes
Proof? Hm, I see. So you're saying that there's no physical evidence throughout human history that proves my existence...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Holmes
There are indeed no official documents or records of my tenancy of 221B Baker Street.

Consider the other heroes other than myself.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Holmes
Hardly any heroes of myth have been proven to exist from the standpoints of cultural anthropology or archaeology. No remains have ever been found.
[k]

＠Holmes
Even places said to be the burial sites of the heroes of legend have provided no proof.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Holmes
One exception would be the Trojan War. Schliemann made the glorious, wonderful discovery that the Trojan War was actual historical fact.
[k]

＠Holmes
Before his great discovery, the poems of the “Iliad” were believed to be no more than legend.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

The same goes for the other heroes.[sr]Many of them are fictional[line 2]characters of legend.

Legends and similarly unverified tales are no more than stories humans tell, correct?

[charaFace A 5]

＠Holmes
The world is spherical, not flat. It is not carried upon the shoulders of the great titan Atlas, as Greek myth would have it.
[k]

＠Holmes
The night is a result of the Earth's rotation, not of the goddess Nyx's cave.
[k]

＠Holmes
There is no record of the evil dragon Fafnir existing in the 5th century, and even the Legend of King Arthur was woven by Sir Malory.

In other words, this world is...

＠Holmes
As they were created to simulate the enemies found in the Singularities, the NPCs are very aggressive.
[k]

＠Holmes
NPCs are obviously not artificial beings. That is to say that they have neither emotions nor personality. Yet, they still have some measure of intellect.
[k]

＠Holmes
At least where matters of battle are concerned. They are equipped with AI so that they can think in battle.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Holmes
They are created expressly for you to battle.
[k]

＠Holmes
Werewolf, Goblin, Wyvern, Hermit Crab, Demonic Boar...
[k]

＠Holmes
And a variety of Shadow Servants have also been created. It appears that these numerous NPCs felt anger each time they lost.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Holmes
Their anger...secretly building up all this time.
[k]

？1：That seems to be contradictory.
？2：...Anger? But they don't have emotion, right?

？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠Holmes
Precisely. “Anger” is not exactly the right word, and it should not even be possible in the first place.
[k]

＠Holmes
They were programmed to win, and yet could not... NPCs should only be capable of acknowledgement of that fact.
[k]

＠Holmes
But someone twisted that acknowledgement into the emotion of anger. And that is our culprit.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Holmes
Well, I will personally deal with the culprit later on...
[k]

For the time being, we must pacify the NPCs our culprit has driven berserk in order to keep the simulator operating smoothly.
