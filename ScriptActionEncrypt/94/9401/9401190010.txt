Seraphix is a North Sea offshore oil rig owned by the Animusphere family.

It is built on a semi-submersible platform, and its team of at least a hundred keeps it running at all hours.

Good day, Chaldea. Don't worry, I may be an AI, but there's no need to be afraid of me.
[k]

＠BB
I'm basically only here because the oil stove caught fire while I was relaxing in my kotatsu.
[k]

＠BB
And by oil stove, I of course mean Seraphix, Chaldea, and all of humanity in this Chronicle Theoretical Phenomenon, really.
[k]

＠BB
Now the stove doesn't matter one bit to me, but I don't want MY room burning down too, you know?
