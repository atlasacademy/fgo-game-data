...You wound me, Sir Gawain.[se ad151]

I have been exploring SE.RA.PH in an effort to capture this BB, and encountered some Servants along the way.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_1 0.1]
＠Tristan
But, they had lost all sense of reason...and become little more than bloodthirsty ogres.
[k]

＠Tristan
I could not leave those once great heroes to drown themselves in blood and hedonism.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Tristan
So, in accordance with my duty as a Heroic Spirit, I put an end to most of the Servants in this area myself.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Tristan
And yet, even they were mere trifles compared to that thing... It was truly a nightmare...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Tristan
...I have seen her for myself. I even fought her several times, but each time I was forced to retreat.
[k]

＠Tristan
She is the ruler...no, the destroyer of this area.
[k]

＠Tristan
Each of the Servants she finds, she folds in a needy caress before crushing them to death...
[k]

＠Tristan
That deplorable...bouncy Alter Ego is a Servant's greatest foe...

This Alter Ego differs greatly from our companion, but is a force to be reckoned with nonetheless.

[charaFace C 4]

Tristan is talking about another being like me.[sr]This way will take us to her domain.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Her name is Passionlip, and she is the Alter Ego of love and hatred. She was born from BB, just like me.

Why am I smiling, you say?[sr]Because I enjoy seeing you suffer, of course.

What, this? This is nothing compared to the pain I could dish out if I were serious.

We have bigger concerns just now, not to mention those two Servants are bound to get in my way. So believe it or not, this is me exercising self-control.
