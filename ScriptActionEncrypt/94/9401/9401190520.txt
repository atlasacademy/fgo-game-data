The important thing right now is that you get some rest. Go choose a room, then sleep for six hours.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
That ought to replenish your magical energy. Don't worry, you won't get digitized as long as you have vitality.

＠Meltryllis
On that note, we'll use this as our base while we explore SE.RA.PH. Got it, [%1]?

Resting up, huh?[sr]Before you do that, I have some information.

＠Emiya Alter
There's a terminal hidden behind the altar.[sr]It looks like it contains some kind of report.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
But it's locked down in such a way that it is impossible for Servants or Alter Egos to open.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
So if you come across a key that can open it, you should. I bet there's some kind of clue hidden inside.
