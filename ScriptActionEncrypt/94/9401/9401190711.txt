What's the story with the “128 new Servants” that Mable woman mentioned?

Are you moving the game to another table, even though this Holy Grail War isn't over yet?

Oh, those? I summoned them, of course!

＠BB
I mean, naturally Lip went and accidentally crushed them all, but I expect I'll summon more once the next stage is ready.

＠BB
After all, there's only around thirty Servants left on SE.RA.PH right now. Where's the fun in that?
[k]

[charaFace B 12]
＠BB
There's no point in a SE.RA.PH without any danger.[sr]When it comes to Servants, the sky's the limit.
[k]

＠BB
I want to fill all of SE.RA.PH with them, so that we get more intense infighting and more violent resistance.
[k]

＠BB
Otherwise...it won't be a proper recreation of the Temple of Time. What SE.RA.PH needs right now is thousands[line 2]no, tens of thousands of Heroic Spirits.

I'm just a game master. It's your karma, your actions up until now, that leads you viewers to draw connections between disparate events.

All right, that's enough Q and A time.[sr]Oh, but one last thing before I go!

There's only one real-world hour left until you hit the seabed, which means you're well into the second half of the Great SE.RA.PH Escape Game! Enjoy!

Merlin might be able to grasp the entirety of this situation, but as we ourselves lack Clairvoyance, we can see no more than what is immediately before us.

[charaFace C 5]
＠Gawain
But that is no cause to despair. We have a clear purpose, and hardy legs to carry us toward it.
