＠Masqueraded Count
First up, Red Venus!
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
I haven't the foggiest notion of who created this craft, but whoever it was, they must surely be a brilliant and exquisitely beautiful genius inventor.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
What's more, she must also be exceptionally generous and open-minded to accept such an impossible request from these two tyrants.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
At any rate, the resulting vehicle is truly wonderous: the pinnacle of functional design, where any artifice unnecessary in the pursuit of speed has been skillfully stripped away!
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
And still, its form remains astonishingly stylish.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
It is as though it is the very culmination of the entire history of mankind's attempts to build the fastest possible car.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
Truly, this streamlined machine with its beautiful, functional design embodies the aphorism “Simple is best.” I award it...ten out of ten!

[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
What a lovely surprise to see Helena's old-fashioned Kumara Wheel repurposed into this futuristic avant-garde design!
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
And then we have its accompanying monster car!
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
Putting the question of what sort of current it uses aside, this mechanism that transforms vast amounts of electricity output into propulsive force may be a little on the overcompensatory side...
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
...but it is clearly the result of the two men assisting her putting all of their pride into their work. Indeed, sheer muscle can be beautiful too.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
And the fact that such opposing views came together to create this single machine is beautiful in its own right!
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
I award this team...ten out of ten!

Demon King of the V6 Heaven!
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
While it does seem a little worse for wear after getting blasted out of a volcano right into the stratosphere...
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
...its form itself is still the stuff of truly amazing dreams. There is something to be said for its pilots' wild nature making itself so plainly evident.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
Though this vehicle does exhibit some fundamental aerodynamic design flaws when driving across the ground, those don't really matter.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
What matters is how beautifully it embodies the concept of wanting to blast off to anywhere besides here.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
Only a true connoisseur can appreciate a machine dedicated to such a single-minded purpose, so as one such connoisseur, I give it ten out of ten!

Pharaoh Legend is patterned after the scarab beetle!
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
This vehicle's form skillfully captures the venerable representation of the sun god Khepri.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
And this team's assistant has also added a low-key Arabian motif to the vehicle's decoration.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
The result is a positively exquisite unified design! Collaborations are a lot harder to pull off than people think, you know!
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
So taking that into account...I think it deserves ten out of ten! Friendship is beautiful in its own right!

Here we have Babbage Locomotive Form![sr]In a word, I find it fascinating!
[k]


＠Masqueraded Count
I'm told that Professor M's calculations played a large part in its design, but I think they could have asked another brilliant genius inventor and gotten the same calculations, personally.
[k]


＠Masqueraded Count
Next time, I'd encourage them to go that way instead of relying on shady professor types, but I'll give them a pass on that for now.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
Regardless, the out-of-the-box idea to turn Charles Babbage into a vehicle is itself a thing of beauty!
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
As a fan of spectacle...er, steampunk...er, giant robots, I'm giving them ten out of ten!

Finally, we have Kyogoku and Bailong! While it would be easy to point out that they're horses, not vehicles...
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
There is no denying their stunningly beautiful coats, long, soft manes, and the kindest eyes you'll ever see in any creature...
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
Truly, wild animals have a rare and uniquely divine beauty all their own.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
Humans can and do make beautiful art, but even that can't compare to the work of God's own hand. Well, except me, of course. Even God himself would be jealous of the stuff I come up with.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
At any rate, these two horses are absolutely two of the most beautiful creatures you'll ever see. As such, they deserve nothing less than ten out of ten! (Also, I really don't want to get on Raikou's bad side!)

Nothing I can do about that.[sr]That's how it goes when you try to evaluate art!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Masqueraded Count
You gotta give credit where it's due.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
You can't just start ranking works of art against each other from best to worst. All you can really do is be honest about whether it evoked a sense of beauty.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Masqueraded Count
At least, that's how I believe art ought to be appreciated.
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
For artists, it doesn't matter what your station in life is, what sort of principles you hold...
[k]

＠Masqueraded Count
...or even if you're just a kid throwing something together.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Masqueraded Count
To try and pretend otherwise would be a crime against the very concept of beauty. That's why it's impossible to force art into a hierarchy of better or worse.
