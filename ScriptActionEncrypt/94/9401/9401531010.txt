＠Prison Guard Carmilla
Hohohoho, how good of you to come!

＠Prison Guard Carmilla
Admittedly you DID surprise me by opening a hole in my wall, but fortunately I'm very experienced in crushing rats as they skulk about.
[k]

＠Prison Guard Carmilla
I do it reflexively, without even thinking. It's just like how one uses a spoon to stir her morning cocoa.
[k]

＠Prison Guard Carmilla
After all, nobody thinks anything about stirring their cocoa, do they? And there certainly isn't any reason why they might be reluctant to do so, is there?
[k]

＠Prison Guard Carmilla
As far as I'm concerned, the phrase “I won't let a single one of you rats get away” is no mere figure of speech.

Indeed, now that you are here,[sr]I will not let any of you escape me!

＠Prison Guard Carmilla
What a strange song you sing, little rat. I hope that you'll at least have the decency to entertain me with a song that is pleasing to the ear; like a girl begging for her life before I drain her blood.

I do not understand what she is doing here, but it seems we must face her again. I suppose it is true what they say; the toughest stains must be scrubbed away at least two or three times!
