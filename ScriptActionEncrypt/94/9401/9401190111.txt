Not bad for a half-dead buncha scrap![sr]This is actually getting interesting!
[k]

＠Suzuka
You are special among the Alter Egos, after all.[sr]Just like the girl from Swan Lake!

Is that so? I'm actually finding this all very...boring.[sr]It's beyond disappointing.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
What's wrong with your body? How is your passive skill able to reduce all external impacts by ninety percent? Don't tell me you've become frigid?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
You probably got the idea from BB, didn't you?[sr]You've certainly fallen far while I was away, Suzuka.

Hah, who do you think you're fooling? You're mega jelly! Karmaphage is like, winner's circle kinda stuff! The mark of a true Sentinel!

＠Suzuka
Besides, I wouldn't even have gotten the gig if you hadn't abandoned your role in the first place.
[k]

＠Suzuka
It's the same with SE.RA.PH, and your fall from grace. The humans only have themselves to blame.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Suzuka
So why shouldn't I get to do what I wanna?[sr]It's not like there's morals or justice here!
[k]

＠Suzuka
So I'll kill all the other Servants, get the Holy Grail for myself, and transform into my Spirit Origin as the Demon King's daughter!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Suzuka
Pretty sweet life goal, right?[sr]Once I've done that, I can choose my own Master.
[k]

＠Suzuka
I'm totes serious about this, you know? So if I want to make my dream come true, I'd better start by taking the kind of power that'll let me do whatever I want!

Is that so. Too bad for you that you're still not seeing the whole picture then. Or is it that you're just so desperate you can't afford to take it all in?
[k]


＠Meltryllis
Did you really think I was just slashing away at you for no reason? Your Karmaphage may be tough, but it doesn't repel drugs or poisons, does it?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Meltryllis
If it did, you could never apply lotion or makeup, and that would just devastate you, wouldn't it?

...Fine. I didn't plan ahead for viral warfare, so you won this one. I'll back down for now.

Besides, this literally isn't my jurisdiction anyway.[sr]I just came to see what all the lightning was about.

As for you, the mediocre Master who's only just realizing how far [&he's:she's] been left behind...
[k]

＠Suzuka
I totally forgot to introduce myself, didn't I? My bad. Lemme take care of that now!

I'm Suzuka Gozen! The daughter of the Demon King of the Fourth Heaven, a Saber, and a high school girl in the prime of her youth!

＠A：Suzuka Gozen
Now that we've met, it's only a matter of time before I hunt you down and cut you to ribbons!
[k]

＠A：Suzuka Gozen
I'm gonna keep your heart for myself, so you and it aren't going anywhere! I'll text you, left-swipe!
