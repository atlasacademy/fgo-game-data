Cute girl who'd be cuter with some sakura petals decorating her: Do you really think you'd be happy if you came to Chaldea?

...Yes, I think so.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
To be happy, to make someone else happy...or even to be happy BY making someone else happy...
[k]

＠Pārvatī
I'm sure there are many different methods.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
But no matter what, as long as I am myself,[sr]I know the people around me will be happy!

Ah-hem. Rest assured. I may have cut away the shadowy parts of myself, but make no mistake, there is such a thing as shadows in the light.

＠Pārvatī
[%1] and the others are well aware that I am not JUST the pure, good parts of myself.
[k]

＠Pārvatī
That's why I am able to somewhat participate in battle. Like smacking people.

Okay! I'll do that!

If something like this happens again, I'm sending Chloe instead. They both act like cats anyway, so they'll probably get along. Yep!

You really are kind, Senpai.[sr]If I didn't have work to do, I would have loved to join.

While I do not have homework, I always feel that studying the books in the library is important.

＠Mash
I'm sure I would make great progress in my studies if I asked Senpai lots of questions, and I'm sure it would be fun.
