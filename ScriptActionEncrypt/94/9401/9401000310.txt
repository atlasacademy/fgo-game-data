It's been so long since we last heard Du Stallion II's jets.

We know so far that her disappearance has something to do with the irregular increase in Heroine Zs.

But we haven't seen Heroine X.[sr]How sad and lonesome...

I've been having fuzzy memories lately.
[k]

＠Ex
Some pretty men are sitting around a black round table, and they're drinking. And I'm just sitting there, looking bored...
[k]

＠Ex
Then then someone special to me secretly gives me candy. It tasted sweet...
[k]

＠Ex
But then the hotties disappear from their seats at the round table one by one, like petals dropping from a wilting flower.
[k]

＠Ex
The quiet round table wasn't bad.[sr]As long as that one man was there.
[k]

＠Ex
Being in my empty room reminds me of that scene.

I'm talking about those who believe you have fighting potential, after the reports they've received from spies here.

＠B：???
A large-scale attack by the Villains will soon start. It'll be a Death Tour, with enough power to destroy an entire planet.

＠B：???
Heroine X will likely not return.[sr]And even if she did, she could not save this place.

Data extraction. Found: a traditional school yard callout to settle old scores. In other words, there's an one hundred percent possibility that a secret art will be passed on due to graduation.
