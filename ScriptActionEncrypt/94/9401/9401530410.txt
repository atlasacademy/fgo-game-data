I found it strange that a Servant of her caliber would not attempt to break out of here, but now I understand.

With that enormous frame she would have no hope of escaping this cell. On top of that, it seems she's bound with chains of divine steel.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
Even if the barrier were to disappear, she would still have no way of escaping. That is why she has no interest in our prison break.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
No doubt the only joy she would have in all this is watching with smug satisfaction as we fail to escape.

I will admit...I am deeply ashamed of the way I have behaved until now. I knew about those reptilian parts of yours, yet I still looked the other way.
[k]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
I told myself they weren't human parts... That they were strange and mysterious... That we didn't have the necessary medical equipment for them... That there were other, more important things I needed to tend to first.
[k]

[charaFace H 7]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
Much as I may have tried to pretend otherwise,[sr]the fact remains...
[k]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
Failing to sanitize some body parts just because they happen to not be human goes against everything I stand for as a nurse!
[k]

[charaFace H 0]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
However, that all ends today.
[k]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
I may have had trouble getting enough medical supplies in Crimea, but in this wonderful modern era, one can order anything and have it delivered right to her door!
[k]

[charaFace H 6]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
Now, I have everything I need. In addition to this spray,[sr]I also made sure to read the “Snake Care for Dummies” book I had delivered with it from cover to cover.
[k]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
As long as one is knowledgeable, and prepared with appropriate medical supplies, one has nothing whatsoever to fear.
[k]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
Until now, I may not have been able to do anything about your snake parts...but today, I will finally sanitize them. Thoroughly.

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
It may be worthwhile to shave them off for sanitization purposes as well.
[k]

＠Prison Guard Nightingale
And yes, I did read in “Snake Care for Dummies” where it said that unlike fish, snake scales are bonded to their skin. So what?

This cell was made especially for you, with generous amounts of divine steel provided by Fionn mac Cumhaill. There is nowhere for you to run.
