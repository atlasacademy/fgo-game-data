...I slowly open my eyes to a dull, aching pain.[sr]I appear to have fallen...
[k]

＠
I know this place. It's the Rejection Calf, Seraphix's disposal facility.
[k]

＠
For SE.RA.PH in its current form, it serves as the trash can for those of us who couldn't be salvaged.
[k]

＠
...I have no time to waste in a place like this.[sr]I need to reunite with [&him:her] immediately.
[k]

...Pathetic. I can't even stand.
[k]

＠
My fragile, glass-like legs are shattered...shadows of their former selves... As if nursing two broken hands wasn't bad enough...

The exhaustion nearly drives the breath from me. The pain in my limbs is almost enough to make me scream in agony.
[k]

＠
...This is what I get for pushing myself too hard.
[k]

＠
Now that I think about it, I've been working for days on end, nonstop, since the last run through SE.RA.PH.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
...Albrecht, Albrecht. I miss you so.[sr]Don't let go of me this time.

Oh? Why would you be disappointed that I've returned to my full strength? It's thanks to you, you know.

＠Meltryllis
What do you mean my tone has changed? Do you have a problem with my attitude, too? Well, what did you expect? This is who I am, after all.

But...what remains in my heart will never change, my sweet [%1].

I might grow weak, I might grow ugly...[sr]But I will never, ever forget.

The time we've spent together will be a part of me forever.

Not all swans that know they're different will fly away from their muddy lake. Don't you think?

I felt nothing but fear and despair back then.
[k]

＠
I cried every night knowing that my abilities might ultimately not be enough to protect that person. Wondering when that crucial time would come.
[k]

＠
But...that person only smiled. And so, my weak self did everything in its power to follow.
[k]

＠
It was so fun that I wept.[sr]It was so harsh that I laughed.
[k]

＠
No matter how hard things got, it was all so radiant.
[k]

＠
I felt like I could follow you to the ends of the earth.
[k]

＠
That's right. I swore that I would fight any opponent as long as I still had breath in my body.
[k]

＠
As horrible as things got, for me, they couldn't have been better...so long as that person was there with me.

“Even if my wings are broken...I'll still fly to your aid.”

...I may or may not have said something like that. But it no longer matters. Because it's not just my wings[line 2]my hands[line 2]that are broken now; it's my legs too.

＠
My body will be crushed along with this garbage.[sr]...And so the cycle is complete.
[k]

＠
I was meant to stop functioning at the church following my disposal. It was a place that no one was supposed to visit.
[k]

＠
That person took this doll's broken hands in theirs...but miracles don't happen twice.
