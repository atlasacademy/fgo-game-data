...I woke to the sound of waves.[sr]Someone had come to the abyss.
[k]

＠
...It must be that human and Servant. What fools they are, coming here even after I warned them not to.
[k]

＠
I may be losing my power, but I still won't have any trouble sweeping out a couple of pests.

＠
Let's make this quick.[sr]I don't have long before I disappear, after all.
[k]

＠
Yes. I'm going to disappear here since I broke my oath.
[k]

＠
...And yet, I don't know why.
[k]

＠
I don't remember anymore. The person I was when I broke that oath was the first thing I discarded.
[k]

＠
I may not know why I did it, but the fact that I'm weakening proves that I did it all the same.
[k]

＠
It's only right that I disappear. So I'll dissolve into the abyss and leave Nergal in charge.

＠
I'm not afraid, and I have no regrets. If I had it all to do over again, I wouldn't change a thing.[sr]...But, there is one thing I can't help but wonder about.
[k]

＠
I know I broke my oath, but...my past self would never have done that, no matter what.
[k]

＠
...So I admit, it's kind of painful.
[k]

＠
Something must have happened to me that led me to do what I otherwise never would.
[k]

＠
And I'm sad and sorry that I can't remember what it was.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
So this is the abyss...[sr]There really isn't anything here besides this water...
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I've heard the herb of immortality grows at the bottom, but I can't seem to sink past these waves...
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠???
Of course not. Did you really think a living creature could sink to the bottom of the abyss without even a guide to show them the way?
[k]

＠???
Now that Enki is gone, the bottom of the abyss is not primordial, but hollow.
[k]

＠???
To reach the bottom of this sea is for every part of you, down to your soul, to return to nothingness.
[k]

＠???
A living human can never become part of it. Just like they can never hope to soar among the clouds.
[k]

＠???
You are trapped here now, repulsive visitors.[sr]This is the end of the line.

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
You should have resigned yourself to dying on the surface. What do you hope to accomplish here?
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
Did you come to save Ereshkigal?[sr]How foolish. No, not foolish. Disgusting beyond belief.
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
The Queen of Kur felt ashamed of her irresponsible conduct, as she should, and chose to leave the underworld to us.
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
She vowed to make amends for ever helping Chaldea, and for permitting them to record data about her.
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
No doubt you came here thinking you could save her from her fate...
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
...but as an outsider, the only thing you are accomplishing is sullying her noble sacrifice.
[k]

Good, Master. Just ignore him.[sr]He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
For one thing, we're not outsiders.[sr]After all, you're Ereshkigal's...
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Um...friend? Classmate?[sr]Coworker from her part-time job...?
[k]

＠Altera Santa
The point is, neither you nor I are outsiders.

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
Where, you say?[sr]Heh. Hehehe. Hahahahaha...!
[k]

？！

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
Think what you like. This is no courtroom, and the decisions here are not up for debate.
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
All I require of you is your deaths, here and now.[sr]For Ereshkigal's sake.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 3.0]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
Once you disappear, everyone who knew Ereshkigal will be gone. Faith in her will vanish completely.
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
Do you understand? The reason Ereshkigal continues to humiliate herself at the bottom of the abyss is because you're here.
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
You came to help her, didn't you?[sr]Don't you want to respect her wishes?
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
Then I shall kill you myself.[sr]Once I do, the underworld will finally be mine!
[k]

The bottom of the abyss... An ocean... I can't believe it. Another hurdle, right at the end...
[k]

＠Altera Santa
My sheep can cross a river if they really have to, but there's no way they can reach the bottom of an ocean...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Altera Santa
Well, I can figure that out later. Right now, Nergal comes first...! Let's show him who's boss, Master!
