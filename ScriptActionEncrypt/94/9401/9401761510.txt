＠Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II
That's right. Every evil underground lair goes out with an explosion. Everyone knows that.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II
I designed this one to explode pretty spectacularly in case I ever lost.

The reactor has been filled to capacity with all the[sr]Elisa Particles gathered from Elisabeth and all of you.

＠Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II
Unless giant Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II goes on a rampage and uses that energy up, it will overload the reactor until it goes critical and explodes.
