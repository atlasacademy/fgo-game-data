＠Holmes
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen.
[k]

＠Holmes
I am Sherlock Holmes, world-renowned investigator, and the world's only consulting detective.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Holmes
I am both the origin and a conglomeration of the very concept of a detective, and I represent all those who shine light on the truth.
[k]

＠Holmes
I shall have the pleasure of leading you to new mysteries and new truths.
[k]

＠Holmes
In consequence of a variety of very particular circumstances, I have manifested as a Servant and have, for the time being, taken up residence in Chaldea.
[k]

＠Holmes
I cannot claim to be utilizing my detective skills to their utmost...but I am still myself, unchanged.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Holmes
The only difference now is that rather than my accustomed seat in my room situated in 221B Baker Street, I presently find myself on Chaldea's multipurpose sofa.

＠Holmes
I gather that for some of you, this is our first meeting, while there are others among you who have long been familiar with my history and skills.
[k]

＠Holmes
If you are the former... Hmm, let's see...simply think of what you are about to witness as memories from the shadows of the future.
[k]

＠Holmes
...or a dream, if you like. Though, lamentably, I am unable to intervene in dreams.
[k]

＠Holmes
Which is to say: this is not a dream.

＠Holmes
Have you ever read the most excellent and famous detective mysteries that feature Sherlock Holmes as their main character?
[k]

＠Holmes
Each features the detective solving various mysteries, set in the 19th and 20th centuries.
[k]

＠Holmes
The stories are frequently adapted to film and other media. Surely you have at least heard of them.
[k]

＠Holmes
...And so, seeing me manifest here as Holmes, one imagines you wondering:
[k]

＠Holmes
“Was Sherlock Holmes an actual individual?[sr]Wasn't he a man of fiction?”
[k]

＠Holmes
Indeed. Curious. Very curious.
[k]

＠Holmes
Am I the manifestation of the character in the stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?
[k]

＠Holmes
Or did the great detective Holmes really exist, and were the stories based on the events of his life?
[k]

＠Holmes
...In other words, were the stories written by Sir Conan Doyle adapted from the biography by Watson?
[k]

＠Holmes
This must be a great puzzle to you all as well.[sr]I had meant to bring this up one of these days.
[k]

＠Holmes
This time around, the story is not about the Incineration of Humanity, nor its restoration.
[k]

＠Holmes
The story is about yours truly.

Normally, the simulator creates stages based on locations we've visited in Rayshifts.

Allow me to explain. The Simulator you normally use to train contained a curious mass of data within the mainframe's internal memory.

＠Holmes
I lent my aid to the staff in an effort to remove it...

[charaFace A 5]

But it has given us quite a fight. And so, I requested the mathematical genius Sir Babbage to help us out.
