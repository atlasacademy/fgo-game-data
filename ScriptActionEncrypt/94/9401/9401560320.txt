Yes. Historically, this is the World's Fair held in 1893.

＠Geronimo
So it is an event to showcase the current culture and innovation of modern nations. Is this sort of boasting really necessary, though?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Geronimo
I would normally think that cultural exchange without combat is a good thing, but this fair is proving to be the exception to that rule.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

This place is fairly dripping with the arrogance of privilege. Hideous. It is truly hideous.

Agreed! This is far from rational!

The worst part is this horrible use of electricity! It's AC! They're using AC!

The Edison Tower's DC should have been more than sufficient!

You're like an argumentative spiritual leader in the guise of a thunder god worshipper. But I still respect you... If you still can call that rational.

I know this place has its flaws.[sr]But it's still fun.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Bunyan
There's lots of buildings. There's lots of detail put in them. The carpenters, the plasterers, and the gardeners...they all put in a lot of effort.
[k]

？1：Do you like buildings, Bunyan?

？！

＠Bunyan
Yep. I like to destroy, but that's my job.

It doesn't matter who the storyteller is. It's an intimate contract between the reader and the work.

Such things are everywhere, but not anywhere.[sr]That's why it's so wonderful! Right, Jack?

Even if you think it has some shape, it will disappear. That's the fate of all stories.
