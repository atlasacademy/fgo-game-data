＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...How deplorable.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I am told there was a remarkable decline in public decency during the “events” of last summer.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
That there were, ah, people running around half naked on a desert island.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
How shameless.[sr]How terribly shameless.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
To think that young people...[sr]Ah, Lady Scáthach was there as well... So hmm...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
The fact that there were people who at least appear to be in the prime of their youth amusing themselves in such a state of undress were there...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...Unacceptable.[sr]Simply unacceptable.
[k]

？1：I don't know if “shameless” is the word I'd use.
？2：We were mostly just trying to not die.

？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...Is that so? Well, if you say so,[sr][%1], I am certain it must be true.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
... (Sigh) Had I only been present, I could have seen to it that propriety was maintained.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
But what's done is done.[sr]I cannot, and have no desire to, revisit the past.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Right now, I am concerned about the present.[sr]Do you know why?
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Summer is upon us once again. A familiar lightheartedness has already settled on Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
No doubt that everyone will once again be disposed to similarly indecent revelry as part of this “event.”
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
They will surely enjoy themselves,[sr]frolicking about like young children might.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
That is all well and good. Indeed, there is nothing wrong with that. It is sometimes even beneficial to combat the heat with an entertaining festival.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
However...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
(Sniff) I am gravely concerned...
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
People may abandon decency, and may cavort about in the nude... Or in some similarly scandalous, salacious, sinful state of undress.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
They may engage in such unspeakable pursuits all summer, shamelessly...like beasts!
[k]

？1：Huh!?

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
The shock I see on your face is all the confirmation I need of just how correct my suspicions are!

[charaFace A 2]

I...I am calm.

[charaFace A 2]

I shall see to it that Chaldea's sense of propriety is not abandoned! Others may see fit to let their decency fall by the wayside, but I cannot permit it!

＠Sakata Kintoki
Yup, I'm talkin' 'bout Raikou. The real her, when she was alive, was SUPER responsible. Real hard worker.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
The leader of the Genji family has a whole lotta power, and she ain't shy 'bout usin' it. She gotta protect the city, no matter what.

And she pulled it off, even with those skinny little arms of hers. Yup, she's a real badass. Super cool, and as golden as they come.

[charaFace B 3]
＠Sakata Kintoki
The part of her you know, that Spirit Origin's a Berserker. So her, uh, maternal instincts...?
[k]

Whatever ya call...THAT... It's all kinda gone into overdrive now. But alla that? It's just a part of her. Not the whole deal. Not by a damn sight.

[charaFace B 7]

If, for whatever reason...
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki

She'd be TOTALLY different.[sr]A cold beauty and a golden general all in one!

＠Sakata Kintoki
For one thing, her instincts to keep the city safe would definitely get way stronger, and that...uh...“maternal” thing wouldn't be so strong.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
When she's doin' her real job, there ain't no one more responsible. She's basically a super prefect.

...Hm? What's up?
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Non-Saber classes? Yeah, I could see that.[sr]She's even got a Noble Phantasm that'd fit the bill.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
If she became a Rider...[sr]Hmm, I guess that wouldn't be much of a difference.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Oh, but a Lancer's close to a Saber. That'd pretty much make her a shadow prefect. In other words...
