＠Record Keeper
To the one viewing these records:
[k]

＠Record Keeper
I want to leave a record of myself behind, before I forget everything.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
In 2016, I was invited to join Seraphix's team as a mental health specialist[line 2]a therapist.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
...Heh. Even in this body, I can't help but smile when I think back on that.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
The first time I was told I'd be working at this church, I remember laughing aloud at the sheer weight of reality crashing down on me.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
Still, historically speaking, priests and churches could certainly have been considered early providers of mental health care.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
So...while I was a bit resentful of the choices that led me to that posting, I went along with it in the end.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
After all, this offshore oil rig was a unique environment. Plus, I didn't have anywhere else to go.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
So I vowed to do whatever I could to help those struggling with mental health challenges here, no matter what was required of me.

＠Record Keeper
Everyday life here on Seraphix was fulfilling.
[k]

[seStop ad31 1.0]

＠Record Keeper
As an oil rig with a two-layer structure, both its buildings, and the relationships of the people who lived and worked in them were enormously complex.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
The more I came to know about Seraphix's inner workings and secrets, the more excited I grew.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
There was the standard crew, and the ones with special privileges. Oil harvesting, and magical energy harvesting. A day staff, and a night staff.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
It was inevitable that friction would develop between the different groups. Every night, I dealt with countless patients in my position at the church.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
“I want to go back to land.” “I'm tired of dealing with everyone.” “I want to die.” “They should shut this place down.” “They should expand it.”
[k]

＠Record Keeper
After listening to all sorts of complaints, I started to wonder why Seraphix was even created.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
I have no doubt whatsoever that it was made with the highest of ideals.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
Those ideals just turned out to be too big to be compatible with the way most people's minds work.
[k]


＠Record Keeper
January, 2019. Something very strange is happening.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
We lost contact with the outside world, and strange accidents keep happening all around the facility.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
The nearly two hundred people left are in a constant state of mild fear.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
Many people were injured. As a therapist, I've been joining the medical team to help victims on-site.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_54 0.7]

February 2019. I've begun to change just like the other staff members have.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
I can't trust anyone else. I only care for myself.[sr]Even the thought of morality has become intolerable.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
Feelings I've been suppressing all my life are flooding back. It brings me to tears, wondering how it has come to this.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
...There's another festival taking place outside the church tonight. There's a bonfire. Gunshots. Men smiling eerily, as if they'd gone mad. Sacrifices.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
I see it, and I feel...nothing.[sr]I can so clearly sense how cold my own mind has become.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
Yet in spite of all this, the obligation I felt to my job remains intact. After all...
[k]

＠Record Keeper
...the whole reason I was brought here was to provide care for the staff's mental health.
[k]

＠Record Keeper
So even if I'm the only one left...[sr]Even if I end up getting killed...
