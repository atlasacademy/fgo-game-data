＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Nothing but shameful,[sr]forbidden acts everywhere I look!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
The problem lies with those bears. In a way, they are an even more direct threat to public decency than what happened in the area we just left.
[k]

＠Sanzang
Yeah, these are some seriously bad bears!
[k]

＠Sanzang
I remember a bear named the Black Wind Demon once stole my kasaya. Thankfully, Wukong got it back for me.

[charaFace A 5]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I once thought a bear would make a good playmate for my son, but these Orion bears won't do at all.

Now is the time to stand my ground. I shall do everything within my power to see that decency is upheld!

If I see something shameful taking place in the east, I shall fly there like a bolt of lightning. If I hear of something shameful taking place in the west, I shall come down like a peal of thunder.

Yes... In order to preserve decency in this depraved world, I must become lightning itself.

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou

[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
The time has come to put this attire aside.

This outfit is both a symbol of my determination to keep the world decent...and the shackles that keep my true power restrained!

“Raikou, whatever ya do, ya better not take that outfit off. Ya need ta keep covered up, or...”
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Then he trailed off while avoiding looking me in the eye. As a mother, I could tell how worried he was about me.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
...However! If it will serve the greater good, I have no compunctions about shedding even this outfit!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
It should be all right. I am sorry to depend on you for assistance, but you have proven yourself a trustworthy companion.
