＠Gawain
We may be some distance from the central area now, but SE.RA.PH's connections cannot be measured by standard means.
[k]

＠Gawain
Furthermore, there are sure to be areas accessible only via this route. I believe it would be wise to explore it.
[k]

＠Gawain
Lady Meltryllis, do you know what this place held before it became SE.RA.PH?

＠Meltryllis
Well, seeing how it's near the Hair, I'm guessing it was for operating and repairing the robotics.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Hands and feet are the appendages that react the most strongly to touch, after all.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
So it must have been made into an Arm because it acted like hands in the seabed investigation.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
This appears to still be the upper part of the arm, but if we can reach the Thenar, we should find the Arm that was used to examine the soil.
[k]

？1：Did you say seabed investigation...?

[charaFace A 6]

＠Meltryllis
Obviously things are messed up now, but usually, this oil rig never dips below the water's surface.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
So they need some type of robotic appendage to find out if there's oil in the seabed below, right?
[k]

？2：Is that true for the Foot area too?

＠Meltryllis
...Good question. Legs are of course stronger than arms.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
The arm robotics were likely used for investigation, but the leg ones are for more destructive purposes.
