Well, crap...
[k]

＠
This all started right after I got separated from the Servants during our investigation of a Singularity.
[k]

＠
I thought that as long as I could stay in touch with Chaldea, I'd be able to meet back up with everyone...
[k]

＠
The Chaldea staff could've told me my coordinates, or even where the Servants all are...
[k]

＠
But every single thing seemed to go wrong.[sr]I tried contacting Chaldea, but got no response.
[k]

＠
I should've heard Mash calling for me.[sr]Instead, all I can hear now is...

...If I had to describe it in colors, I guess it's red and black. It howls like a beast hungry for blood.
[k]

＠
I'm in a tight spot here.[sr]What Mystic Code did I put on before we left?
[k]

＠
If I could at least cast Gandr, I'd shoot one off. Then, regardless of how that goes, I'll just book it as fast as I can!
[k]

＠
...But, will that really work?
[k]

＠
Sweat trickles down my cheek. My mouth trembles. Think. Think. But that beast doesn't look like it'll give me time to think...
[k]

＠
I'm taking a chance.[sr]Whether it'll work out or not...

...You've got some guts.

You watched that attack and didn't so much as flinch.

＠Knight
Do you have some knowledge of swordplay? Or, I suppose you have been through more than your share of trials...

Whoops, sorry.[sr]Looks like we don't have much time to chitchat.

You're certainly no ordinary person. If you were, you'd have fainted when you stared that beast down.

I'd love to talk to you more in detail...[sr]but [charaFace B 5]I don't have the time.

＠Knight
Are you by chance a mage? Well, at least you don't seem to be completely lost in a battle of magecraft.
[k]

＠Knight
That magical energy enveloping you must be Command Spells. Are you a Master?
[k]

[charaFace B 6]
＠Knight
Well then, you must have some experience dealing with Mystics, which are so far beyond simple magecraft.
