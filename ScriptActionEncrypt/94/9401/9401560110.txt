＠Edison
Ah, my apologies. That may have been a bit much.[sr]Allow me to explain our situation.
[k]

＠Edison
A mere twenty-seven minutes ago, we observed a slight space-time fluctuation over Chaldeas.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Edison
It was a very small anomaly, but showed no signs of natural decay, and so you Rayshifted to accompany us on a mission to investigate...
[k]

＠Edison
Sadly, we've lost communication with Chaldea. Currently, we're working to repair the Spiritual World Communicator and restore communications.
[k]

？1：So you haven't given up on the Communicator.

？！

[charaFace C 1]

＠Edison
Of course not. With Miss Blavatsky's help, the Spiritual World Communicator has been strengthened!
[k]

＠Edison
With the power of science, we shall debunk all the world's many misconceptions! And if the spiritual world proves to be real, we can expand our consumer base!

I'm back, king of inventors. Based on the vegetation and the stars, we're definitely in North America.

However, I did not see any airplanes or satellites.

Hm, so it is safe to assume we are in America prior to the 19th century. Or at least a world very similar.
[k]

＠Edison
Still, we're not at all clear on our situation.[sr]We had to Rayshift quite suddenly.
[k]

＠Edison
There is a possibility that we are in a distant future where humanity becomes extinct, but let's not think so pessimistically.
