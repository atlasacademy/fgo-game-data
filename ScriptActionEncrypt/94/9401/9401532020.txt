Th-that's right. This race was originally supposed to erase the Singularity here.

That IS a good question. All of the magical energy collected in this race has been poured into Gugalanna.

＠Da Vinci
There are no resources left that can be allocated to erasing the Singularity. Much as I hate to say it, it would seem that Ishtar has deceived us and[line 2]

N-no I didn't. I totally accounted for this, okay?[sr]Getting my Gugalanna Mark II was all part of the plan!

I always meant to use his ultra Divine Beast power to take care of the Singularity!

I just have to get rid of the distortion, right?[sr]I'll just have him stomp on it like a roll of bubble wrap!

Fortunately, there's still time. All Ishtar needs to do is give back the magical energy she diverted to Gugalanna.

The primary reason I took part in this race to begin with was to help Master resolve this Singularity.

...While I will not deny that I had reasons of my own as well, I cannot allow this most important of aspects to come unraveled at the end.

Okay, maaaybe I went a little too far with swindling everyone out of their bets...

＠Ishtar
But in general, my getting a new Gugalanna is a good thing, right? Just imagine all that power, fighting on yo[line 2]our side!
[k]

[charaFace F 6]
＠Ishtar
Sure, its divine radiance might be so intense that it crushes all sorts of tangible and intangible things...
[k]

＠Ishtar
...but that's a small price for such a big payoff. If anything, you should be thanking me for bringing him back.
