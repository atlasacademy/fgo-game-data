We are in Wisconsin's Central Plain.
[k]

＠Edison
It is a V-shaped region in the center of the state and is particularly well-suited to dairy farming.

？1：Maybe we can find a farm that can give us food!

That seems quite unrealistic, Master. Besides, that is the mindset of a pillager. Though... I don't mind...

We should earn QP honestly, by raiding treasuries.[sr]I do like the golden doors that drop golden boxes...

I want either a lake full of oatmeal, or an oil field-sized plate of yakisoba...!
[k]

？1：Yep. It's tough being giant.

[charaFace D 4]

＠Bunyan
Yep... I could eat a horse or twenty-seven...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Bunyan
Yep! When I was digging an oil field on the West Coast, some Chinese workers made some for me.

＠Geronimo
Oh, it is hardly strange, Master.[sr]I usually eat them raw or skewer them.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Geronimo
I've also had it in a bleu cheese fondue.[sr]That was good in itself.

＠Geronimo
It tastes like a lean beef filet.[sr]Master, you should try...

No. We could probably hunt the entire North American squirrel population to extinction and do little more than make an appetizer for her.

I'm sure Mommy was captivated by Chicago.

Because Chicago is humanity's wisdom itself.[sr]It's eccentric and metafictional.

It's corrupt and self-referential.[sr]It's a city that deconstructs and subdues modernity.
