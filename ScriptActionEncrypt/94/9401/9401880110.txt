Hard as it is to believe, Chaldea's being scorched with summer heat...in December...

And with the heat has come some kind of plague.

We're still in the middle of preparing to move our entire operation, but most of Chaldea's staff has called in sick with high fevers...

＠Mash
Da Vinci just collapsed into bed before she could even begin the monumental task of transferring control over Chaldea to the new team coming...
[k]

＠Mash
Mr. Holmes, however, adamantly refused to remove his coat for anything, and ended up collapsing from heat stroke while working in the hangar.
[k]

＠Mash
And every other Servant in Chaldea is out of commission with some kind of strange fever...

The way we're going now, Chaldea would be lucky to last another day...

It seems that you have not yet succumbed to the fever,[sr][%1]. In which case...

You must have acquired some resistance to it during your escapade in the underworld. And then there is this heat...
[k]

[charaFace E 3]

＠Gilgamesh
...Hmph. I see what is happening here. Those idiots in the underworld have made another mess of things.
[k]

？1：You know where this heat is coming from!? Great!
？2：Do you have any treasure that can fix this!?

？！

[charaFace E 1]

＠Gilgamesh
Heh. No matter how capable a sage I may be, you cannot simply expect me to solve all your problems for you!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
However, in recognition of your piety, I will be generous enough to summarize what is happening.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]

＠Gilgamesh
Listen well, mongrel![sr]If something is not done, Chaldea is doomed!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Ridiculous, you say?[sr]Right you are! This is absolutely ridiculous!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
A cold is a nightmare even for a Servant![sr]And this...this is no ordinary cold!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
This is the terrible illness that even the gods themselves fear: Sumerian Summer Fever!
[k]

？1：Sumerian...Summer Fever?
？2：(I think the heat may have gotten to him too...)

？！

[charaFace E 3]

＠Gilgamesh
Indeed. It is Mesopotamia's leading cause of death, and an invitation to the underworld that always comes in the heat of summer.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Some modern countries have times when the souls of the dead mingle with the living... The Bon festival in Japan, for example, yes?
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
In the Age of Gods, summer was our season of death.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Its merciless heat sapped the lives of the frail and aged alike.
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Unlike any other mere virus, the Sumerian Fever has a sort of will to it. It is an invitation to die, a plague sent by the gods of the underworld.
[k]

？1：So, this heat is from the Mesopotamian underworld?

？！

[charaFace E 1]

＠Gilgamesh
Indeed. Believe me, I know what I am talking about.[sr]The underworld is attacking Chaldea!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Only one person can resolve this great crisis.[sr]The task of figuring this out falls to you, mongrel.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

＠Gilgamesh
Surely you have some idea? You owe a great debt to the underworld. Now the time has come to repay it.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]

＠Gilgamesh
That is all I have to tell you! Remember, there will be no Christmas until this has been resolved!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
Do not look at me like that.[sr]I am just as unhappy about this as you are!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I was so sure this was the year that Dark Santa would pay me a visit!
[k]

？1：I see. Well, I guess even kings can dream.
？2：Hey, wait! Exactly what do I do here!?

＠Gilgamesh
That is how a true traveler of Uruk should conduct [&himself:herself]. Now go, reclaim Christmas for Chaldea, and more importantly, for me!
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I shall use every resource available to assist you in achieving this goal! And so, I shall make my most tyrannical move to date...
[k]

＠Gilgamesh
I shall commandeer Chaldea's systems and use the last of my power to Rayshift you!
[k]

[charaFace E 2]

＠Gilgamesh
But be warned! At this time of year, the underworld is transformed into a cavernous pit!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Gilgamesh
Don't think you'll just waltz right to your goal the way you did on your last visit. Fwahahahaha!
