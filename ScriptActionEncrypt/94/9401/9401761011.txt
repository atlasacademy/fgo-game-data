Singing, huh...

Even with my new heart circuit,[sr]I can't see what's so great about singing.

Can it really help the Demoness of Fresh Blood face the pure evil inside her, and come to terms with it...?

Is singing really all that great?[sr]What do you think, my pilot candidate?

？1：Maybe you'll find out if you try singing yourself?

[charaFace D 9]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
I fail to see the need for that, so: request denied.

[charaFace D 0]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
But if you sing for me yourself, I will base my own data analysis on your performance.

That response is extremely vague.[sr]How, exactly?
