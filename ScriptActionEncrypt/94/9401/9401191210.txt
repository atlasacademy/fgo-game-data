It looks like another location on SE.RA.PH, but I don't remember any passageway with a layout like this.

...Hmph. Getting in close to fight an enemy who can crush anything she sees? Reckless, but gutsy.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
And it paid off.[sr]Passionlip deals best with faraway, slow-moving targets.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
Enemies in close, darting around quickly are another story.

＠Emiya Alter
Thanks to his sacrifice, we made it safely to our destination, and didn't lose anyone else.

Got it! [%1], huh. What kind of lame-o name is that? You choose it yourself or something?

Still, I like you. You're a lot better than those suuuper boring Masters who can't move at all!
[k]

I get it. You're not the type to give in to BB or the Alter Egos. I'm gonna take like, such good care of you!

If you want to break our contract to make one with her, now's your chance. I bet she'd be pretty devoted...in her own way.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Of course, since she's also more beast than human, affection and appetite may not exactly be mutually exclusive for her.
[k]

？1：Hard pass.

[charaFace A 10]
