Now then, there are four checkpoints between the starting line here and the finish line.
[k]

＠Ishtar Commentary
Whenever a team reaches one of these checkpoints,[sr]they'll be required to stop...
[k]

＠Ishtar Commentary
...and wait for every other team to reach the same checkpoint. Naturally, each team's time will be closely monitored all the while.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Ishtar Commentary
Once every team has reached that checkpoint...
[k]

＠Ishtar Commentary
...the race will resume with all vehicles leaving from that checkpoint's starting line at the same time and continuing to race until the next checkpoint!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Ishtar Commentary
Since it's a long way to the finish line, the idea is to break up the race into five smaller courses.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Ishtar Commentary
However, at the last checkpoint before the goal,[sr]instead of all vehicles leaving at once...
[k]

＠Ishtar Commentary
...the time difference between each team will be tallied up, and they will have to wait until the corresponding amount of time has passed before they can go.
[k]

＠Ishtar Commentary
This is so we don't have vehicles getting too far apart from one another. That'd be really boooring!!!
