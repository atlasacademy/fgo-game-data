That statue stood out like a sore thumb when we first got here...but at some point, we must have gotten so used to it that we stopped paying it any attention.

Incidentally, that was one of my 48 Pushing Fifty Techniques in action: “Say something that sounds appropriately detective-ish to prevent anyone from grilling you on why you didn't notice sooner.”

So if we can manage to do something about the control device in that statue, we may be able to get rid of the barrier... Is that right?

Well, yes, but Medb is very aware of how important the device is. Security is bound to be tighter than ever.

What's more, using my Presence Detection, I can tell there's someone else in this prison who's nearly as powerful as her.

For example...in addition to myself, I've heard there's another maximum security prisoner who happens to be a master of disguise.

I presume you can take it from there?

＠Helena
We'll get this master of disguise to trick Quetzalcoatl and have her deactivate the Prison Field for us.
[k]

＠Helena
There are just two things we need to confirm.[sr]First, is Quetzalcoatl authorized to do that?
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk E]

＠Enkidu
Definitely. I've noticed that the Prison Field's[sr]range and strength are adjusted occasionally...
[k]

＠Enkidu
...and it has happened at times when Medb is far away from the prison. In fact, the most recent adjustment was made right before you all arrived.
[k]

＠Enkidu
I'm guessing she contacted the prison to inform them she was bringing in a group of powerful prisoners so that they could strengthen the barrier a bit before they arrived.
[k]

＠Enkidu
And it could not possibly have[sr]been Medb who made the adjustment.
[k]

＠Enkidu
While Medb is surely the core of the barrier's power, the fact that the barrier is rooted here in this location tells us something important.
[k]

＠Enkidu
It is impossible for one person to manage alone.

＠Helena
Good. Now here's the second thing: if we're going to trick Quetzalcoatl into following false orders, those orders will naturally have to come from a false Medb.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Helena
Is that going to work? I mean, can this person really disguise himself as Medb well enough to fool her?

If this master is as good as they're rumored to be, that shouldn't be a problem.
[k]

＠Enkidu
I'm told that they can transform into anyone, male or female.
[k]

＠Enkidu
Supposedly, they can mimic their target's Spirit Origin somehow.

I will just ask directly:[sr]Is this master of disguise a detective?
[k]

＠Enkidu
Hm? No, I don't think so.
[k]

＠Enkidu
For one thing, detectives usually send people to prison, not get sent there themselves.
[k]

＠Enkidu
If this person is anything, then according to the rumors I have heard, I would say they are...a phantom.

＠Ishtar
It sounds like you should be able to dig your way to the cell of this mysterious master of disguise from here.
[k]

＠Ishtar
...Okay, I've officially made their cell the next checkpoint. If you want to get rid of the Prison Field, you'll have to get this phantom person to join you.

＠Ishtar
Once you've done that, you'll be that much closer to your escape!
