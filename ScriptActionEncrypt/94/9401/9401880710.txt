Hmph. Turns out none of it was anything special.

If that's all the surface has to offer, the underworld is better off without it. Not to mention it's way dirtier up there thanks to all that life!

“Don't be sad.” “The underworld is completely barren.[sr]It's not your fault they didn't grow.”

The gazelle droned on like usual while I glared at the sky, fighting back tears.

“The underworld doesn't need flowers anyway.”[sr]“It's not as though they're anything special.”

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
Now that you have broken your oath,[sr]you have no right to rule over the underworld.
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
As long as you harbor such doubts, it is only a matter of time until this place falls into disorder.
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
Which is why I must ask you...[sr]Please, cut out those memories.
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
Return to the perfect woman you once were, before you sinned and became an imperfect goddess.
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
Once you have done so, you must sleep forever in the abyss. Through your sacrifice, the underworld will continue in peace and prosperity.
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
Leave the rest to us... We will see that the underworld gains a more fitting ruler.
[k]

＠Evil Gallû Spirit
All of this is to ensure the underworld's survival...[sr]Please, fulfill your final duty as the Queen of Kur.

I let myself fall into the abyss. I cast away this new me that was created when I gained this avatar.

...How strange. Usually I would be crying from loneliness, but right now, I'm actually smiling.

Now that it's all ending, just thinking back brings a smile to my face. I've been so lonely, but back then, I had so much fun I can't help but be happy.
