Well hello there, Master![sr]You seem to be in rather a good mood.

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Would you care to tell this sprightly and certainly not at all old man what has you in such high spirits?

Of course, we were very thorough in our questioning.[sr]We even presented her with mug shots.

＠Babbage
And out of a lineup that included Caesar, Paracelsus, and Shakespeare...
[k]

＠Babbage
...she had not the least bit of trouble picking you from the bunch.

I appreciate the fact that without you leaking information about this technology, I would not exist. However, that does not change that what you did was evil.

And as Mecha Eli-chan, guardian of justice, I am sworn to punish evil wherever I find it. My fist is literally iron, after all.

Ah yes, Isaac Asimov. That reprehensible author who first wrote about the rights and obligations of AI.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan
But of course, the point of that book was about how to get AROUND those three laws.

Furthermore, you're a Heroic Spirit, not a human, so I have no obligation to protect you whatsoever.
