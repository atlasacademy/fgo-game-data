There were a few unbelievable encounters,[sr]but let's just delete them from our feeds.
[k]

[charaFace B 17]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Oei, while we're walking, would you mind[sr]telling us something? I'm just curious...
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
If we never find your Toto-sama,[sr]what happens to you?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
[charaFace A 7]
＠Oei
If we can't find him?[sr]Well, you know...
[k]

[charaFace A 16]
＠Oei
Our client here is the shogun; we're doing this for the top man here in Japan. This is a whole other game from just mouthing off to the police.
[k]

＠Oei
If we offend him, we'll be getting off[sr]easy if all he demands is seppuku.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Oei
At worst, he could have us executed,[sr]our assets seized, and our family line ended.
[k]

[charaFace B 15]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Seppuku!? That, like, kills you!
[k]

？1：That's what happens when you cross[csr]the highest authority in the land...
？2：Didn't that the, uh, Old Meowster call herself[csr]a vice shogun or something...?
？！

[charaFace B 13]
＠Suzuka Gozen
I know! Hey, Oei...
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Even if we can't find Toto-sama,[sr]why can't you go up in front of the lord?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Sick, right? That was, like, the best idea!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Oei
D-don't be ridiculous! The invitation was for[sr]Toto-sama... The actual Katsushika Hokusai!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Oei
Unlike you, I can't just do a magic quick[sr]change and show up saying I'm Hokusai...

An eboshi hat, that dance costume[sr]...and your swordsmanship...!

Suzuka...are you THE Suzuka Gozen!?[sr]The beautiful thief of Mt. Suzuka...!?

＠Oei
Legends and lore from all eras and lands are[sr]the tools of the trade for painters like us!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Oei
Toto-sama was always so passionate in collecting reference materials like that.
[k]

＠Oei
Not only does he have popular picture books, but also tons of scrolls, illustrations, and art from Karakuni.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Oei
When I was a child, I enjoyed reading them at his side.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠Oei
Then I learned that the reason money's always tight no matter how many paintings get sold...
[k]

＠Oei
...is the vast amount Toto-sama spends on all those reference materials and the cost of paint. Anything left over goes to the disciples' wages.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]
＠Oei
After I learned about our situation,[sr]I felt a bit conflicted. Haha.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Oei
I see, I didn't realize you were actually Suzuka Gozen. I'm impressed.
[k]

＠Oei

＠Suzuka Gozen
Master. Don't you think this is all weird AF?[sr]Like, something might happen...
[k]

[charaFace B 17]
＠Suzuka Gozen
...It's faint, but I sense[sr]a divine presence from Oei.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
And it's getting stronger. When she went into that half-naked courtesan mode... That was just the beginning.
[k]

？1：A divine presence? Are you saying she's starting to gain Divinity?

[charaFace B 1]
＠Suzuka Gozen
I'm not talking about logic here.[sr]My Divine Power is telling me so.
[k]

？2：So we're in Oei's dream?

＠Suzuka Gozen
I can't say for sure, but that's[sr]probs the correct assessment.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Suzuka Gozen
People talk about “false dreams,” or how if you dream something the opposite will happen, right?
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
What that means is that not everything will[sr]necessarily go in your favor in a dream.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Sometimes dreams attract things that a person is subconsciously afraid of...things they never want to happen.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Master, you get affected by dreams a lot, right?[sr]You should be aware of that by now.
[k]

[charaFace B 17]
＠Suzuka Gozen
I have a sense that whatever is happening in this dream is ultimately not good for you.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
If this super realistic and super detailed dream turns into a nightmare...
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
...we may end up in over our heads here.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Not only would there be mental corruption, but any spiritual injuries we suffer here in the dream could also affect our physical bodies in Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Or, even worse...we may not be able to return at all...
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
Yeah...I have nothing but bad vibes about this...
[k]

？1：Really? Do you really think so?
？2：I do see that Hokusai was a godly painter, but...
？！

＠Suzuka Gozen
Hey, I don't want to flame Oei either...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Suzuka Gozen
...but my job is to warn you, right?
[k]

？1：Yeah. Thanks, Suzuka Gozen.

[charaFace B 16]
＠Suzuka Gozen
That's how I roll! And getting advice from[sr]a high school girl's gonna cost you!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
...Why do you look so surprised?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Suzuka Gozen
When we get back to Chaldea, I'm gonna make a special New Year's request that'll be big enough to cover whatever work I do here!
[k]

？2：That's the sort of advice I'd expect from someone wielding[csr]a sword forged by the Bodhisattva of Wisdom.

[charaFace B 7]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Riiight!? This is totally helpful[sr]and literal Clairvoyance on my part!
[k]

[charaFace B 17]
＠Suzuka Gozen
...Oh, one request though:[sr]solve this whole mess quick, 'kay?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Don't make me...draw my sword on one of my own...
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Okay! We need to catch up to Oei![sr]Hm? Something on your mind, Master?
[k]

？1：Do you think we're in Katsushika Hokusai's dream?
？！

[charaFace B 15]
＠Suzuka Gozen
Not Oei's, but Hokusai's dream?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Suzuka Gozen
...That's a good point.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
That would make total sense,[sr]as Hokusai himself hasn't made an appearance.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Suzuka Gozen
So what do you think Hokusai wants to do? Is he afraid that something's gonna break if he does turn up?

During tomorrow's viewing with the shogun, the painters from the Utagawa school were supposed to demonstrate with Toto-sama.
