＠Meltryllis
I see. So that's your story.[sr]Well, good job breaking it all down.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Chaldea's situation, the reason you came to SE.RA.PH, and BB's asinine presentation...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
It fits pretty well with what I expected.[sr]It seems protecting you was the right choice.
[k]

？1：Why DID you choose to protect me...?

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
Happenstance. I saw that a new human had dropped in, so I went to see for myself.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
I knew that BB was paying extra attention to you for some strange reason, so I figured you must be more important than the other Masters or researchers.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
At any rate, is that really your only question?[sr]There's still a lot you don't understand, after all.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_55 0.7]
＠Meltryllis
Let's see... Why don't we start with SE.RA.PH.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_1 0.1]
＠Meltryllis
SE.RA.PH is a digital labyrinth loosely based off of the Seraphix oil rig...
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Yet it's still only an imitation.[sr]The original SE.RA.PH is even bigger.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
You see, the inside of the moon is an entire world made up of photonic crystals called Mooncell Automatons. That world belongs to us rather than humans.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
The original SE.RA.PH was a city-type engine that was created to run this giant Mooncell processor[line 2]
[k]

＠Meltryllis
It was a network that excelled in its role by having many humans, AIs, and NPCs live inside of it.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
It was also the site of the Moon Holy Grail War.[sr]You have Holy Grails in your world too, right?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
In our world, the Mooncell itself is an inexhaustible Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
It also chooses for itself which human will wield it.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
But the Mooncell is just an observational device. It has no way to make value judgments about the quality of humans within it.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
So it opted to use a battle to the death as a “fair and impartial standard” for weeding out candidates.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
It invited 128 Masters to SE.RA.PH, and had them compete to win the Holy Grail.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
It didn't care what the surviving human was like, or what methods they used to survive. It simply decided that whoever survived would have proven their superiority...
[k]

＠Meltryllis
So the Moon Holy Grail War ended up a slaughterfest. And now, things are more or less the same here on this SE.RA.PH too.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
That said, one difference is that the Moon Holy Grail War was a tournament, rather than this barbaric free-for-all battle to the death.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
It lasted for seven rounds, and the administrators decided who would fight who.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
In that sense, it was actually quite rational.[sr]But the one on this SE.RA.PH is anything but.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
“Kill whoever you want, as many as you want.[sr]All that matters is being the last one standing.”
[k]

＠Meltryllis
That is the sort of trap you find yourself in now: a battle royale.
[k]

？1：Then, does that mean BB is...?
？2：Why do you resemble BB so much?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
BB is a high-grade AI, an information life-form mapped out all the way down to her soul. She was stationed on the moon during the Holy Grail War.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
She was to keep Masters healthy during the war...[sr]A pure, righteous being in charge of their health.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
But then, she bugged out and started to style herself as the Ruler of the Moon.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Her prime directive to PROTECT humans started creating errors, and she now thinks that MANAGING humans is what she should be doing.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
She even went so far as to take control of the Mooncell. However, she messed up and lost to a human.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
As for me, I was an aspect of BB's personality before she cut me away from herself. I'm the Alter Ego that was created from her sense of pleasure.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
That's why the other Alter Egos and I resemble her[line 2]we were all born from her.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Meltryllis
Of course, now that I'm an Alter Ego, she and I are completely separate life-forms.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
So I'm under no obligation to obey her orders.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Honestly, I saved you just to piss her off.[sr]I do hate humans, but I hate BB even more.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Meltryllis
So, does that satisfy your curiosity? As far as I'm concerned, humans, Masters or otherwise, are no more than a source of experience points.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
You and I are not equals, and we do not trust each other. Is that clear, human?
[k]


[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_1 0.7]
？1：Yes. I won't say anything about how nice you are.
[bgm BGM_EVENT_7 0.1]
[charaFace A 5]
＠Meltryllis
Really? Because I could have sworn you just did.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
If you consider a perfunctory summary like that to be “nice,” I have to wonder if you actually have a capybara inside your head instead of a brain.
[k]

？2：Yes. By the way, that outfit is really something.
[bgm BGM_EVENT_7 0.1]
[charaFace A 5]
＠Meltryllis
Of course it is. It's easy to move around in, streamlined, and, above all, shows off my perfect figure.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
It is chaste, feminine, and in all other aspects a perfect garment for the ultimate Alter Ego. If anything, it deserves even more praise!
[k]

[charaFace A 9]
＠Meltryllis
In fact, you SHOULD praise it! Go on![sr]I think I deserve at least that much!
[k]

？！

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_7 0.7]
[charaFace A 0]
＠Meltryllis
...Never mind. Now is not the time. Getting out of here before you dissolve is marginally more important than praising my outfit.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]
＠Meltryllis
Since you lack a Master's proper detection abilities, I should tell you that there are other Servants up ahead.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
And as I said earlier, every Servant you meet here is your enemy. You'll have to defeat them to stay alive.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠Meltryllis
...Hehe, this one should be easy, though.[sr]He hasn't noticed we're here.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Luckily, one of my many specialties is ambushing my enemies. I'll take him down before he even knows what's happened.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
All you have to do is give me the order, and maybe help out with a Command Spell if things take a turn.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Meltryllis
...I hate to say this, but I'm afraid I pushed myself too hard on the way here.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Consequently, I'm unfortunately just a tad below my peak performance level.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
If we're really unlucky, I could even end up losing to a lower-class opponent. So make sure you're ready with a Command Spell in case we need it.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
If you could be generous enough to use one that lets me unleash my Noble Phantasm at the start of the battle, that would be even better...
[k]

？1：I see you're not much for strategy...
？2：Isn't that for fighting higher-class opponents...?

？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠Meltryllis
Oh, shut up. I was just suggesting a more effective plan of attack!
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Besides, if I win, you win! So don't hold back and do everything you can to support me!
[k]

＠Meltryllis
...Okay, the enemy Servant's now within firing range! Let's crush them, [%1]! But keep it elegant!
