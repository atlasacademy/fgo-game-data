Heh, damn, I can't believe you figured me out already.[sr]Really, though. Did you not know this is my thing?

And here I thought you'd keep me entertained a little bit longer.

So...why do something like this? I mean, I'll grant you that it gave us a pretty clear picture of your abilities. So, in that sense, it was kinda entertaining.

Wait a second... (Light bulb)[se ade116][sr]Can you turn yourself into any Saber that ever lived?
[k]

＠Mysterious Racer X
And if so, does that mean I can lower the universe's Saber counter by murderizing a few of your Saber incarnations?

Hmm, I don't know about that... I mean, when I defeat a copy of Wukong, it doesn't really do anything to hurt the real Wukong, right?

＠B：???
It gets really boring here in prison. It's been so long since I had visitors that I couldn't help myself.
[k]

＠B：???
Once I started, it was so much fun that I didn't want to stop... Honestly, I was kinda lonely. Sorry 'bout that.

Hmph, I detect not a hint of remorse from you. Still, if you claim to have been lonely, we have little choice but to sheathe our swords.

After all, even the fiercest warrior cannot battle solitude. And in your case, you appear to be especially fond of company.

＠B：???
Let's see... Since you already heard I'm a phantom,[sr]I think I'd better run with that.

[charaFace B 1]

＠B：???
Since I'm a man of countless countenances,[sr]you can call me the Phantom of ∞ Faces!
