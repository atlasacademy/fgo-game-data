“However, under no circumstances will SA156 harm the girl in question. If the subject is engaged in preparing an “evil scheme” (see Appendix E)...”

＠Babbage
“...the girl will generally have an opportunity to negotiate with them, thereby neutralizing the threat posed for a variable duration (see Appendix J). If the threat has been neutralized, contact a Master...”

＠Babbage
...and have them use a Command Spell to effect total sealing of the SA156 instance.”

[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Professor M
“I wonder what it would be like if Babbage could transform, like one of those robots?” “An excellent observation indeed, Mr. Edison.”
[k]

＠Professor M
“First he could go 'whrrr clank clank'...” “Yeah, and then this could turn here, and that could turn here!”

＠Professor M
“And before you know it!”[sr]“He could end up like this!”

...This rather enthusiastic conversation was eventually supplemented by several diagrams and illustrations.
