Na[voice 9010005_0_M730]turally, this was the only fitting end to this pharaoh's tale...[wait voice 9010005_0_M730][charaFace B 1]but [voice 9010005_0_M731]it's still great to finally come out on top!

I've managed to lay claim to the victor's cup...but now comes the real problem.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]
＠Nitocris
How do I report this to Pharaoh Ozymandias without seeming either too excited or too disinterested?
[k]

＠Nitocris
Something tells me that it would be inappropriate for a pharaoh to be too happy about a victory that should have been a certainty anyway...
[k]

＠Nitocris
But at the same time, acting like it was no big deal would belie how difficult it actually was to win, and make me a small-minded liar...
[k]

[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Nitocris
That's right.[sr]I, Nitocris, have returned as the victor!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Ozymandias
Of course you have. That is hardly surprising or interesting. But I suppose I will ask you this.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
What were your thoughts...your feelings upon winning?
[k]

[charaFace B 9]
＠Nitocris
W-well, uh...[sr]I suppose first and foremost...
[k]

＠Nitocris
I am relieved that I did not fail to live up to your expectations of me, Pharaoh Ozymandias.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Ozymandias
...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Nitocris
(Oh no, he's displeased! I knew it![sr]I really am a failure as a pharaoh!)
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Ozymandias
...Why do you not rejoice?
[k]

[charaFace B 8]
＠Nitocris
Huh? W-well...as you said, Pharaoh Ozymandias,[sr]a pharaoh's victory should have been a certainty!
[k]

＠Nitocris
And yet, I had to struggle till the very end.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Ozymandias
A struggle, hmm?[sr]Indeed, as pharaohs, our victories ARE certain.
[k]

[charaFace C 9]
＠Ozymandias
But in your case...I knew all along how you would struggle to accomplish yours.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Ozymandias
However, that has nothing to do with this.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
If a pharaoh could truly win merely by virtue of being a pharaoh, there would have been no need for you to enter this race to begin with.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Nitocris
Th-then...why DID you allow me to enter it, Pharaoh Ozymandias?
[k]

＠Nitocris
If you knew what would happen all along, then...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Ozymandias
Yes, of course I knew how it would end.[sr]That is precisely why I let you enter.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
I wanted you to claim the glory of victory with your own hands, and see how thrilled you were upon doing so.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]
＠Nitocris
Huh...?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Ozymandias
The victory itself was not what interested me.[sr]That was indeed inevitable. Boring.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
Instead...I was expecting you to return with something else worth seeing.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Ozymandias
And yet you did not. This should have been quite the spectacle, interesting at the very least, but it bores me. There is only one problem here, Pharaoh Nitocris.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
You have disrespected me by failing to live up to my imagination. Do not make me sigh in disappointment.
[k]

＠Ozymandias
...Hmph. This is what comes of thinking too shallowly.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

I shall pardon this mistake of yours only once.[sr]Try again.

＠Nitocris
Y-yes, sir![sr]In that case...

I won, Pharaoh Ozymandias![sr]I, a pharaoh, went out there and claimed my victory!

＠Ozymandias
Good. Well done, Nitocris! That is how the pharaoh of the heavens ought to look! THAT is truly an expression worthy of the sun itself!

Even if this is what we agreed on, I still feel bad about keeping the reward all to myself, so I thought I would at least come and thank her once again.

That man is the kind of king I dislike dealing with the most...

Even if I can act to be certain of not dying at his hand, you never know what he might do next...

＠Partner Caster
Besides, I could never face her if I ended up losing this talisman she made for me on the very first day...
[k]

＠Partner Caster
At any rate, it seems that the Singularity in question has been dealt with successfully.
[k]

＠Partner Caster
I hope that our racing helped to make things easier for Master, if only a little...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Partner Caster
...Though I suppose whether that was enough to atone for my sins will have to be a story for another night.
[k]

＠Partner Caster
For the moment, I should just make certain that this story wraps up neatly.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Partner Caster
So on that note... This concludes the summer tale of the fierce, yet kind, pharaoh.
[k]

＠Partner Caster
If you wish to hear the next tale, then I beg you:[sr]please don't kill me...
