That True Demon... Or rather, that Evil of Humanity in this reality, got the best of you.

Sessyoin Kiara, the depraved nun and boss of SE.RA.PH very nearly ended you!

[charaFace C 9]

...Well, your Servants actually DID die, technically. All of them, in fact. You should really try a bit harder next time.

Time travel in the digital world is actually pretty simple[line 2]so long as it's a time leap within a Quantum Locked period.
[k]

＠BB
Well, a leap of up to three hours, give or take.[sr]You need the right coordinates in space, though.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]
＠BB
Specifically, this classroom is outside of SE.RA.PH. About a hundred meters or so above it.
[k]

＠BB
SE.RA.PH digitized the Mariana Trench as it passed through it, you see...
[k]


＠BB
Under these special circumstances, the higher you go, the farther back you go in time.

＠Tristan
...So we may venture up from SE.RA.PH, hmm...
[k]

＠Tristan
Pardon me if I am slow to grasp, but does this mean that if we leave SE.RA.PH and return to the surface, we could go back in time by two and a half real-world hours?
[k]

＠Tristan
...Which is to say, back before all this began?[sr]Before Chaldea's Master arrived?
[k]

[charaFadeout G 0.1]

[charaTalk C]
[charaFace C 4]
[charaFadein C 0.1 1]
＠BB
Theoretically, yes, as long as you get the coordinates right.
[k]

＠BB
Problem is, once you're in SE.RA.PH, escaping Kiara's sexual allure[line 2]kinda like a gravitational field really[line 2]is no easy task!
[k]

＠BB
For one, you would need to exceed the speed of light.
[k]

＠BB
I mean, that's definitely possible in the digital world, but the Spiritrons that compose Spirit Origins wouldn't be able to survive the stress of those speeds.
[k]

＠BB
Accelerating to those speeds would make short work of even an A-rank Servant.
[k]

＠BB
So even if you did try to escape SE.RA.PH, you'd probably burn up in the process. At least, that's what would normally happen.

But SE.RA.PH cannot be left to its own devices.[sr]You know that, right?
[k]

[charaFace C 8]
＠BB
It would result in that vile Evil of Humanity, Beast III, becoming one with the earth.
[k]

＠BB
Not even I can laugh that one off. Don't forget it was the reason I was dispatched to SE.RA.PH in the first place.
[k]

？1：What?

＠Robin Hood
Just one problem: we don't stand a chance!!![sr]If we had a hundred Servants, she'd still flatten us!

[k]

？1：“R”? As in the ”right” side of something?

[charaFace C 0]
＠BB
Yes. It's also short for “rapture.”[sr]I just came up with that right now.
[k]

？2：What, like rated R? Shouldn't it be...

[charaFace C 10]
＠BB
...Tell me, Senpai.[sr]Did you leave your brain back with Kiara?
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 6]
＠BB
I did some digging, and found that some Beasts come in pairs.
[k]

＠BB
Left and right. Yin and Yang.[sr]In that sense, Kiara is the R of Beast III.
[k]

＠BB
...Or rather, that is what she's becoming. You could say she's like a butterfly about to emerge from its chrysalis.
[k]

[charaFadeout C 0.1]
[wt 0.1]
[charaTalk G]

[wt 0.1]
[charaTalk C]
[charaFace C 6]
[charaFadein C 0.1 1]
＠BB
Hmm. I wonder. When I say “a butterfly yet to emerge,” what I mostly mean is that she will be free to move, versus being unable to move at all.
[k]

＠BB
Kiara used SE.RA.PH to become a Beast, but she's also still bound to SE.RA.PH.
[k]

＠BB
So what I mean by a butterfly emerging in this case is that she and the planet will fuse together once SE.RA.PH reaches the earth's core.
