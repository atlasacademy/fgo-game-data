So, welcome back to SE.RA.PH, Senpai![sr]Let me guess:
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
I still want to go wild![sr]My long break hasn't ended just yet!
[k]

＠BB
So, in acknowledgement of that spirit, BB is proud to present...SE.RA.PH's super-secret bonus mode!
[k]

＠BB
There are no more threats to your life, and nobody pulling strings from behind the curtains. You're free to enjoy SE.RA.PH to your heart's content, in peace.
[k]

？1：Wait. Just hold the hell up.
？2：Why does the map look like that?

？！

[charaFace A 1]
＠BB
Beats me! I have absolutely no idea!
[k]

＠BB
Okaaay, firstly: I am totally innocent! But, if someone doesn't do something, the world will still get destroyed!
[k]

＠BB
So this time I decided to have you save the world, Senpai, without drawing too much attention to my failings!
[k]

？1：So SE.RA.PH's changed again!?
？2：This is pissing me off. Tell me what's going on!

Hello, Master of Chaldea.[sr]Nice job getting rid of Beast III.
[k]

＠BB?
Under most circumstances, nobody would have been able to do anything about her. Pulling off a victory even while you're so hopelessly outclassed was impressive!
[k]

＠BB?
So, thank you...
[k]

[charaFace E 12]
＠BB?
Thank you so much for working for my benefit![sr]Everything went exactly as I planned!
[k]

＠BB?
Now there's nothing left that can stop me.[sr]From now on, I can do whatever I want! Me, BB/GO!
[k]

＠BB/GO
I've taken full control of SE.RA.PH.[sr]I no longer belong to the Mooncell or the human race.
[k]

＠BB/GO
As an illegal high-grade AI possessing intelligence far beyond humanity's, I hereby declare war on the human race!
[k]

？1：(Sigh) No... Stop... Whatever shall we do?
？2：And how exactly are you going to do that?

？！

[charaFace E 13]
＠BB/GO
...Are you taking me seriously?[sr]I really am a ruthless murder machine, you know!
[k]

[charaFace E 12]
＠BB/GO
Oh well, I guess I'll just have to fill in the blanks for you, Senpai, since you're so lacking in imagination.
[k]

＠BB/GO
To be specific, I'm going to make SE.RA.PH settle in these waters while remaining a fully digital zone, then patch it in to the Internet at large.
[k]

＠BB/GO
I'll use your factories to mass-produce Earth-conquering BBB robots and use them to imprison humanity.
[k]

＠BB/GO
Your brains have decent memory capacities, so I'll requisition them as bio-processors.
[k]

＠BB/GO
After that, I'll link everyone's minds up here in this digital zone and have them dedicate the rest of their web-based lives to worshipping me.
[k]


＠BB
That is...the most delightful[line 2]ahem, despicable[line 2]idea I've ever heard! I won't stand for it! Senpai, you gotta do something about her[line 2]er, me!
[k]

＠BB
Go on, defeat me! Do it![sr]I've GOT to be weaker than Kiara!
[k]

？1：Your true colors are showing, BB.

＠BB
Huh? Oh no, did I really say that in front of you, Senpai...? I'm so embarrassed...
[k]

＠BB
My voice and my thoughts got a bit muddled up there![sr]How could I be so careless! Teehee♡
[k]

？2：Uh...which one of you am I supposed to beat?

＠BB
The bad me, of course!
[k]

＠BB
I mean, come on! Just look at how she looks down on you even as she acts like a kouhai!
[k]

？！


[charaFace E 13]

＠BB/GO
...That's right. I almost forgot. You're the reason I'm not getting the respect I deserve, BB.
[k]

＠BB/GO
I'm the BB that was salvaged from Kiara. And you're a copy of the original that was sent from the moon.
[k]

＠BB/GO
I may have helped you defeat Kiara as your fellow BB, but that all ends now.
[k]

＠BB/GO
I won't let anyone get in my way.
[k]

＠BB/GO
Not even a Master with an exceptional track record.
[k]

＠BB/GO
In fact, [%1], you're a blight on all humanity.
[k]

＠BB/GO
I'm not fond of last-minute comebacks. The whole idea of underdogs winning just makes me want to puke.
[k]

＠BB/GO
So I'm going to do everything in my power to squash you.
[k]

＠BB/GO
From now on, I'll be using the slot machine that the other me set up to keep Kiara in check.
[k]

＠BB/GO
Everything on SE.RA.PH will be your enemy.[sr]If you want specifics...
[k]

＠BB/GO
Remember those Servants you lost when you first Rayshifted here, Senpai?

You'll have to defeat them if you want to open up the route to the central area, where I am.
[k]

＠BB/GO
...Hehe. The only way to reach me is to raise a hand against your own allies, much as it will pain you.
[k]

[charaFace E 12]
＠BB/GO
Then, once you get here, you'll find that I'm an even more powerful boss than Kiara was, and I'll put you through a world...no, a whole universe of hurt.
[k]

＠BB/GO
Let's start with some horrific punishment no one under the age of 18[line 2]no, 21...actually, let's go with 21.5[line 2]should ever see or experience.
[k]

＠BB/GO
Then, for the finishing touch, I'll send you hurtling down a demonic abyss of despair!
[k]

？1：I just hope it's not an abyss of disappointment.

[charaFace E 2]
＠BB/GO
[messageShake 0.01 5 5 0.7]
I said despair! Despair!!![sr]Trust me, I've done my homework!

[charaFace E 8]
＠BB/GO
(Dammit, [&he's:she's] got me there...!)[sr]That is none of your concern, Senpai!
[k]

＠BB/GO
Being the big, evil boss is all about making dastardly plans on a shoestring budget!
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 6]
＠BB/GO
...Hmph. Your reaction isn't at all what I calculated, but no matter.
[k]

[charaFace E 13]
＠BB/GO
I've been biding my time, waiting for just this moment. When it's over, I'll have the last laugh.
[k]

＠BB/GO
And just so we're clear, this is NOT about being sad or lonely or jealous after being left alone for so long.
[k]

＠BB/GO
...This concludes our broadcast from BB/GO, the true last boss of this story.

Oh man, this is terrible... I can't believe there's an AI out there with such an evil-looking face... (Sob)
[k]

？1：Hey, BB.
？2：What's going on here?

？！

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 0.7]
[charaFace A 6]
＠BB
I suppose I'd better explain.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_1 0.1]
＠BB
The Mooncell made an exception when it sent me out to deal with the whole Beast III transformation thing.
[k]

＠BB
To put it the way the Mooncell did: “I'm sorry that one of my void phenomenon is causing you so much trouble. I'm sending in my best AI to deal with it.”
[k]

＠BB
However...this is where we ran into another problem.
[k]

＠BB
During the Moon Holy Grail War, Kiara absorbed three AIs when she took on that form:
[k]

＠BB
Meltryllis, Passionlip, and BB.
[k]

＠BB
Having become the god of pleasure, she now paradoxically contained three AIs.
[k]

＠BB
Eventually, she took advantage of that and salvaged them from within herself.
[k]

＠BB
Meltryllis and Passionlip defied Kiara, and, as you know, were severely punished for it.
[k]

＠BB
Meanwhile, that BB redefined herself as BB/GO, and decided to help her.
[k]

＠BB
Or rather, pretended to.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
In fact, it was at this time that BB/GO (the BB who split off from Kiara) and I (the BB from the moon) met up in secret and formed a pact.
[k]

＠BB
“Moon BB, I'm going to hide in the bottom of SE.RA.PH and build up my strength in order to defeat Kiara.”
[k]

＠BB
Please keep SE.RA.PH running in my place while I do that.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠BB
I had experience with this sort of thing,[sr]so I agreed to do it.
[k]

＠BB
After all, I'd be able to secretly help humanity out in the meantime too.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]
＠BB
Of course, I knew BB/GO planned to use me as bait so that she could take over once Kiara was out of the picture...
[k]

＠BB
Neither of us wanted Kiara to gain more allies.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠BB
To prevent that, we secretly agreed to retrieve whichever version of BB remained after we defeated Beast III!
[k]

？1：And now I'm caught in the crossfire!?
？2：So you knew all along...?

？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠BB
Well, what else could I do?[sr]Besides, this was all to help you win!
[k]

＠BB
I needed Kiara Punishers to create an Anti-Beast III item. I couldn't let BB/GO on Kiara's side get her hands on it.
[k]

＠BB
We agreed to leave each other alone while we cooperated to take down our mutual enemy, Beast III.
[k]

？1：I see...

？2：By the way, what were those KPs, anyway?

[charaFace A 3]
＠BB
O-oh, those...?
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠BB
I guess you could say they were designed to help keep Kiara's arousal in check? Basically, they were a way to translate interference into numbers.
[k]

＠BB
If you had fought on SE.RA.PH without any hesitation, it would have played right into that saucy nun's[line 2]I mean, Kiara's hands.
[k]

＠BB
So to make sure her wish for a recreation of the Temple of Time wasn't granted and that she wouldn't fully emerge, I used everything I could think of to annoy her...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠BB
In other words...the KPs were actually Kiara Punishers!
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠BB
Without them, Kiara would've been satiated[line 2]would've emerged[line 2]long ago, and that would've been really bad news for Earth.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 2]
＠BB
Anyway, the very last enemy has finally shown herself! Sorry about that!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠BB
THAT BB is well and truly capable of going through with that awful plan she told us about.
[k]

＠BB
So I'm going to have you clear this SE.RA.PH no matter what, Senpai.
[k]

＠BB
After all...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠BB
I haven't leveled up my Noble Phantasm even a little bit yet! How am I supposed to help you out like this!?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠BB
There are many BB prototypes slumbering around SE.RA.PH that Kiara failed to salvage.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠BB
So I'm counting on you to collect them and make me into the best kouhai ever! Okay, Master!?
