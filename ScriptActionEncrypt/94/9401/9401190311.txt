A liquid body... How careless of me. My arrows can pierce water, but they cannot stop the onrushing tide.
[k]

＠Tristan
To kill you, I would need a way to deal hammer blow powerful enough to hollow out the ground itself.
[k]

＠Tristan
...Or perhaps a source of heat great enough to dissipate a lake, such as Sir Gawain's sacred sword...
[k]

＠Meltryllis
Now that I've shown him my trump card, it'll be a lot of trouble to trap him again.

So I'll let you two take care of him.

Settle this now, so he can't come after us again.

There you have it, Tristan. As a knight, I am sure you know how to pay your respects to the victor.

We have no desire to take your life.[sr]In fact, we could use your help.

It also appears that you are fighting for some deeper purpose than an accursed Holy Grail War.

As you are the victor, and appear honorable, I will join you, if only for the time being.

Hahaha, worry not. For the Round Table, this sort of quarrel is more of a pre-battle warm-up.

As long as they are on speaking terms, things between them will improve in time.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Gawain
That said, I admit I have never seen Sir Tristan open his eyes to threaten someone before...
[k]

＠Gawain
But nonetheless, we Knights of the Round Table are very understanding. I expect they will be close friends by the time one of them perishes!
