I get it, Oei[line 2]or rather, Katsushika Oui. I have witnessed both the doubts and the hidden ambition of your giant brush.

[charaFace D 3]
＠Mr. Gold, the Playboy
I cannot clearly see the fate of this father and daughter... As such, I have no right to make a decision.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Mr. Gold, the Playboy
Honestly, I am keenly interested in[sr]this Foreigner situation as well.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Mr. Gold, the Playboy
A nation that treats all visitors and[sr]outsiders as evil surely has no future.
[k]

＠Mr. Gold, the Playboy
So show me. Which will come first? Will humanity crumble away, or will your singular resolve create a new fate?
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Mr. Gold, the Playboy
I watch in anticipation!

？1：Are we really in THAT dire of a situation!?

[charaFace D 1]

Of course you are. Enjoy it, mongrel.

After all, what are humanity and cultural advances[sr]worth if one can't keep a sense of humor?

A man unparalleled in human history. A man who perfected a pathless road, reaching for the place where truth and fiction meet...

I will personally tell the shogun that a painter with great skill will come in place of Hokusai.

There's no way the shogun would entertain such an absurd request! It would take a magistrate of Edo or something to get him to listen...!

(Sigh) I had a feeling I wasn't going[sr]to make much of an appearance...

...but I guess I shouldn't be surprised, because if BB-chan went all out, this whole thing would be over in a snap, and that would ruin everything.

Always be mindful of where the stars align. Know that, should you make a mistake, Edo will not be all that sinks.

I only did what a protector of a city is supposed to do. But you know what...Edo has some interesting architecture... What's this[line 2]a wooden house...?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Mr. Gold, the Playboy
Is it made of wood because of the weather? Or is it built with the belief that it is going to be rebuilt soon? Well, I suppose its only weakness would be against fire...
