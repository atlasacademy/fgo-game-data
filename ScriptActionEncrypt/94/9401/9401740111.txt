＠Cursed Arm
I had some time on my hands, so I pick up things that can be recycled. I'm the sort who collects all the daggers I throw from the battlefield.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
And this habit has left it somewhat painful for me to see the culture of fast consumption in this age. It can be so terribly wasteful.
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
After a while, the young men who had time and shared in my beliefs gathered here and began to assemble and volunteer their time to assist me.

Hawkmo from third street even landed his dream job at an IT company...and I am also going to start work at this company called Gold Mansomething.

You shouldn't judge people by their looks, you know... What matters is leading an honest, hardworking life!

Right. Even if he was judged by his looks, no matter what his past was, our mentor's unwavering spirit to keep going was what attracted us to him.

Yes, I am an assassin...a nominally evil being.

＠Cursed Arm
But now, I am first and foremost[sr]the Servant of Master [%1].
[k]

＠Cursed Arm
Without being ordered to do so,[sr]I would certainly never attack at random.
