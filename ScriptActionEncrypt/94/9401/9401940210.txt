I've left the other disciples with Nishimuraya[sr]to handle the ukiyo-e sales at the Enkou-in.

So I'm going to take a rest.

Presenting your painting in front of the shogun?[sr]So you're going to paint in front of him?

[charaFace B 13]

The shogun ruling Edo, huh?[sr]So, like, the Seii-Taishogun! Is he hot!?
[k]

[charaFace A 15]

Are you talking about Lord Ienari? Not one bit.[sr]There's no such thing as a good-looking shogun.

[charaFace A 9]

Ahaha, sorry 'bout that. I was just kidding.[sr]Don't get so mad.
[k]

＠Oei
But it doesn't matter as long as he has work. He's as important a customer to me as the townsfolk are.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Oei
Toto-sama has never cared much about money,[sr]but lately he's completely indifferent.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

So money's always tight...

[charaFace B 13]

By the way, what were you going[sr]to paint for of the shogun?
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Oei
It's supposed to be an auspicious painting fit for New Year's. We were tasked to paint a Treasure Ship for him.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

Toto-sama may not be here, but we have no choice.[sr]I'll at least prepare the tools and references.

[charaFace B 14]

OMG. All those paintings of beautiful women, so gorgeous... But they were drawn in such a gross room!
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
There's a half-eaten bowl of rice just SITTING THERE on the floor! Yuck! Clean up a little!
[k]

[charaFace A 16]

What!? Cleaning!?
[k]

＠Oei
We haven't cleaned this place since we moved in!
[k]

[charaFace A 15]

And I've never cooked in my life, if I may add.

Ah, that's a Kukai statue.[sr]It's the blessed, great Koubou-Daishi.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

Oh, so THAT'S where that was hiding.[sr]It's no painting tool, but thanks for finding it.
[k]

＠Oei
Toto-sama prays to it every morning and night.[sr]It represents the Myouken Bosatsu.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

Maybe that's why Toto-sama was in a bad mood...

Toto-sama went up there to pray a lot in his youth.[sr]He was really struggling back then, and near to giving up.
[k]

＠Oei
I'm not sure if it's true or not, but Toto-sama said he narrowly escaped death when a lightning bolt struck right next to him.

[charaFace A 11]

And since that happened,[sr]the work has been pouring in.
