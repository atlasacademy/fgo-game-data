By the way...may I ask you something about that headband?
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
You never truly meant to use it, did you?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Sanzang
Nope. You could tell, huh?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Sanzang
The one I can produce is just a simple imitation of the one Lady Kannon gave me.
[k]

＠Sanzang
It doesn't last very long, so there wouldn't have been much point in putting it on that bear.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

＠Sanzang
Besides...I might use it for a while when fighting monsters, but it's not really something I like doing.
[k]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I see... Is that because it is a sort of one-sided punishment, devoid of love?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Sanzang
Hm? Well, yeah, that's part of it, but more than that,[sr]it's just kind of passive aggressive, you know?

＠Sanzang
If someone does something wrong, you should just tell them so on the spot in no uncertain terms. That's what being a teacher is all about, right?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Sanzang
And you can't do that if you're mumbling to yourself from the shadows.

＠Sanzang
When I first began my journey, I had a really long way to go[line 2]not to say I don't still have a long way to go even now...
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Sanzang
And I think Lady Kannon gave it to me as a way of helping me out. But now, I don't need its help anymore.
[k]

＠Sanzang
These days, I bet I could even reach an understanding with Wukong with nothing but my bare hands! Especially now that I've got so much virtue built up!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
I see. I agree that there are some things which can only be conveyed through direct interaction.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
That is why I am on this journey to protect public decency.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Sanzang
Exactly. I bet I've built up a lot of virtue on this journey alone. Now that it's almost over, I'd like to tell you this again...
[k]

＠Sanzang
Thank you for inviting me. I'm glad I did this.[sr]I guess the Buddha really was on our side, huh?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Minamoto-no-Raikou
Ah, if only others were as appropriately ashamed of their unacceptable appearances as you, and had agreed to come on a journey to make amends...
