Now I see. So you want to defeat Medb, and to do that, you were looking for someone with the knowledge you needed and the ability to perform the necessary calculations.

I have to say, though, if you aren't the dastardly, bizarre, intellectual prison professor we were hoping to find, I'm afraid this was all a waste.

Oh well, it's not as though we were exactly guaranteed[sr]to succeed here. I guess it can't be helped...

Given how many people don't give pharaohs the respect we deserve lately, it's wonderful to meet someone who properly understands the importance of compassion.

Of course. While I may not be some sort of criminal mastermind, I am a weapon. Calculating the ballistic trajectory of a projectile is a core function of mine.
[k]

＠Enkidu
And, of course, I already know the layout of the prison.
[k]

＠Enkidu
The courtyard's setup, the palace with the warden's office, all the other structures... I may not have seen them directly, but I am able to perceive them clearly enough through the resonance of the earth.
[k]

＠Enkidu
It's not like anything besides me can turn into anything else, after all.

If we need more information,[sr]there are numerous ways to collect it from here.

I prefer to think that if one takes risks and engages in foul play, one will be richly rewarded.

＠Professor M
Remember that we have been digging beneath this prison in an attempt to escape it AND freeing other villainous criminals as we do so.
[k]

＠Professor M
At least from our wardens' perspective,[sr]we must be quite the villains ourselves.

[charaFace G 1]

＠Professor M
...Well, no matter. Thanks to our new friend here, we now have the data we lacked. All we need do now is incorporate those numbers into our equations and[line 2]

Come, show me how out saddest, most wonderfully naïve prisoner is doing, just like you always do.

In return, I'll laugh at you, lecture you about life in captivity, and grind my teeth as I fight my urge to drain your blood!

...You can't be serious. We keep prisoners in solitary confinement for a REASON! How can you not see that?

That applies whether you're a poor victim who's been marked by the Blood Countess, or a vampiress who has been imprisoned for her sins.

This simply will not do.[sr]It will not do!

I will never, never, never let anyone escape their incarceration before their sentence has been served!

That goes for all of you just as much as it does Enkidu.

Though I will say I'm impressed that you've managed to dig this far. As a reward, I shall fill your tunnels back in with your anguished screams!
