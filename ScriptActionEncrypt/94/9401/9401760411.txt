Hmm. If I had to guess, I'd say that we shouldn't have chosen this battle for our first team up.

Now come on, we're almost to my tower![sr]Soon we'll have both our sanctuaries back!

[charaFace F 1]

＠Elisabeth
Yeah, that reminds me. Once we take back your tower, will you be able to get Himeji Castle off my castle?
[k]


[charaFace E 5]

＠Osakabehime
Uhh.
[k]


[charaFace E 4]

＠Osakabehime
Uhh... Y'see... I sorta...don't really know why it even ended up here myself, so...
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Elisabeth
Figures. Just 'cause you're the castle's lord doesn't mean you would have a Noble Phantasm that could move it. I bet only emperor Heroic Spirits can do that kinda thing.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Elisabeth
Oh well, we can figure out how to float it off later. Who knows, maybe we'll even find another Holy Grail fragment lying around somewhere!

Anyway, this tower place should be a lot easier to climb than the others. Let's go check it out, Master!
