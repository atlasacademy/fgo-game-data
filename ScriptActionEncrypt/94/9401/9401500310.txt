I've been waiting for this moment! Last year's barbecue tournament may have ended in a draw, but this year will be different!
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Nikola Tesla
A draw? I see you still refuse to face reality.[sr]I quite handily won that tournament!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Edison
Oho, so you remember our match last year, you oddball? I don't know what else I should have expected from the man who showed up at the beach wearing a suit.
[k]

＠Edison
What a truly bizarre idea that was. What was in your head to make you wear such a tight suit? Was it all you could afford? Did it remind you of your boyhood?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Edison
Regardless, it's sad to see one so lacking in fashion sense! It almost makes me wish I could share my all-weather suit with you!
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
If anyone here has made foolish, bizarre choices in their manner of dress, it is you. Since you seem to have forgotten, let me refresh your memory.
[k]

＠Nikola Tesla
Our venue was a barbecue on the beach! We competed fiercely to prove which of us was the superior cook, even as the blazing sun cooked us in turn!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Edison
Of course I remember that much, you fool! I also remember how I missed my chance to try Japanese beef!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Edison
But that's my only regret![sr]Why, you ask? WHY!?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Edison
Because in the end, you turned pale and had to have Ms. Blavatsky nurse you back to health, all because you were a vegetarian!
[k]

What a right fool you looked! Though I will say you did look quite comfortable, using her lap as a pillow! Some gentleman you are! Wahahahaha!
