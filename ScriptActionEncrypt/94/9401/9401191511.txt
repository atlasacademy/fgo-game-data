Of course, I was originally created with the intent of fighting the Sakura Five, but that's waaay too much exposition to get into right now!

Like, a could-fill-up-its-own-RPG level exposition! A Cursed Crazy Cat RPG! But you'll just have to find some other way to learn about that!

[charaFace A 6]
＠Tamamo Cat
I gotta say though, even though you two are sisters, don't you think you're both seriously unbalanced?

＠Tamamo Cat
I get that Lip is all chesty and punchy and Melt is all leggy and kicky, but even taking that into consideration, your personalities are wildly different.

[k]

＠Meltryllis
I was based off of BB's aggressive personality, and Lip was based off of her defensive one.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
In other words, I embody torment, and she, suffering. I am most alive when I'm hurting my victims. Lip is the complete opposite.

She's got very sensitive skin, so just the slightest bit of damage is enough to send her reeling.
[k]


[charaFace C 6]

＠Meltryllis
Her reactions are so extreme that she inadvertently provokes others into wanting to torment her, even if they're not normally like that.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
You should try it yourself if you ever get the chance,[sr][%1].
[k]

＠Meltryllis
You'll start with just a little tap, and before you know it, you'll be beating her so severely that people will be staring in horror.

My sense of touch is really dull, especially in my hands. Fingers are meant for feeling things, right?
[k]

＠Meltryllis
But while I can move mine okay, I can't feel my own body warmth, or anybody else's.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
That's why I have no choice but to thrash my opponents.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Meltryllis
I can't really feel my own joy very well, so it's only when I see how much pain I'm causing someone else that I truly feel alive.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
I have to dominate them. To thrash them into a state that only I can see. To make them beg at my feet.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
That's the point when I can finally understand...what it feels like to love someone.

...Yes. I don't know which area she's using for her temple, but I can make a pretty good guess: the very center of SE.RA.PH, the Spine.
[k]

＠Meltryllis
She's also probably been given the strongest Karmaphage, so she's definitely the one in charge of the rear side.
[k]

Beating her will definitely open up a new route.

＠Emiya Alter
If you're going to take on another Sentinel, you should play along with BB's game. The key to her heart, was it?
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
That should negate the Karmaphage's effects. And you'll need to, because we can't beat a Sentinel like her in a normal Servant battle.
