＠Tamamo Cat
Stop right there, Suzuka Fox! Why are you disappearing? Weren't you about to throw yourself off that ledge!?
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
We clawed each other up like cats and dogs, but only inside your heart! Your body should be just fine!

＠Suzuka Gozen
We schoolgirls are fragile in body AND heart! If my heart gets crushed like this, I'm literally gonna just die!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Suzuka Gozen
And the truth is...[sr]I knew I was gonna lose even before the fight started.
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
I lost the second I failed to avenge my Master and started bitching about there being no place for me in the world.

＠Tamamo Cat
Hahaha! Come on, don't be like that! Seeing as how we're one and the same[line 2]earwise[line 2]I'll help you commit seppuku later, but not today.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Tamamo Cat
Besides, if you're ready to throw your life away, why not fight alongside us instead?
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
I'm sure Gawain up in heaven is sad to see that we don't have a Saber in our party anymore.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Tamamo Cat
And don't worry! I'm a former Sentinel myself![sr]Master wouldn't treat you like a stray cat or anything!
[k]

＠Tamamo Cat
You've fought valiantly up to this point, Suzuka![sr]You make a fellow fox-ear proud!
[k]

？1：Join us.
？2：Don't kill yourself.

？！

[charaFace A 3]
＠Suzuka Gozen
B-but where's the honor in that?[sr]Shouldn't I be like, ending it all, right here, right now?
[k]

＠Suzuka Gozen
I'll get totes shamed for not knowing when to stay down! I mean, embarrassing much!? I'd rather die than have to put up with that!
[k]
[charaFace B 6]
＠Tamamo Cat
What do you mean? Surviving is a victory. Nothing'll come of your return to the Throne besides the ones in charge catching a break. One less payment to make.

＠Suzuka Gozen
You know, that kinda makes sense.[sr]That's the one thing I don't want: to make them happy.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Tamamo Cat
Then we have a deal! Stop with the sparkles!
