＠Altera Santa
Farewell, strange ghosts with silk hats. If you haven't had your fill yet, come back and see me again.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Are you all right, [%1]?[sr]Good. That's the most important thing.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Hmm... Yes, I can see you're still in free fall.[sr]Hurry, grab onto my sheep and[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Altera Santa
Oh. Never mind. It seems that's not necessary. You are falling slowly, as if through a pile of sheep's wool.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
So you will not need my help to reach[sr]the ground safely. See? So soft...
[k]

？1：Whoa, you're right. I AM falling slowly...

[charaFace A 6]

＠Altera Santa
Indeed. No wonder you are the great sage who led not one but two Santas to success. A Christmas miracle.
[k]

？2：Never mind that. What was with those ghosts' hats!?

[charaFace A 6]

＠Altera Santa
It IS Christmas, you know. Even ghosts dress for the occasion. Of course, as Santa, my own dedication goes far beyond mere accessories.
[k]

？！

＠Altera Santa
At any rate, now that the danger has passed, allow me to introduce myself again. I doubt you recognize me in this outfit, after all.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I am Altera, the great warrior-king of the Huns.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
...And, as you can see, I am also Santa Claus.[sr]THE Santa Claus.
[k]

？1：Yeah, I uh...I got that...
？2：Are... Are you seriously THE Santa Claus?

？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠Altera Santa
Hmm, I see. This outfit is not quite complete, so it only makes sense you'd have your doubts.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Wait right there.[sr]I'll be right back as a perfect Santa.

？1：Can you tell me what's going on here?

？！

[bgm BGM_EVENT_2 0.1]

＠Altera Santa
That's...kind of a long story...[sr]And I'm not sure I can tell it properly...
[k]

＠Altera Santa
To tell you the truth, I thought everything would just fall into place once I met up with you...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Altera Santa
No, I must not become dejected. I am Santa Claus, and I am here to judge the value of Christmas.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I must see for myself whether this civilization is naughty or nice.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Altera Santa
If you understand my circumstances now, then I would ask you to be my guide.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
[%1], you have led many Santas to success. You are clearly the master of the ways of Santa.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Now...I would like to debut as a great Santa Claus in my own right.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I want to show everyone that even we Hun warriors can throw a good party.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Altera Santa
But to do that, I will need your help. Fortunately, there is still some distance between us and the first gate of the underworld.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
So let's share what we both know while we're still falling. Is that all right with you, Master?
[k]

？1：Uh... I guess...

＠Altera Santa
I'm glad to hear that.[sr]This will be a great help for me too.
[k]

？2：Fine with me. Anyway, thanks for saving my life!

[charaFace A 7]

＠Altera Santa
N-not at all. I should be thanking you. This was my very first battle, so I was more than a bit nervous.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Altera Santa
All right then, let's head for the first gate.[sr]I'll explain more once we are on solid ground.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
You'll descend into the depths of the underworld, and I'll go deliver presents. The sheep from before said our goals are in perfect alignment.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Altera Santa
So you could even say we're of one mind and body.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Okay, our goal is to reach the very bottom of the underworld, the pure water abyss. You can employ my cane of the god of war as you see fit!
