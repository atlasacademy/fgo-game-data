I am Altera. No more, no less.[sr]But I am not the Altera you are familiar with.

...But I have heard your voice.[sr]Your plea to try to save that girl.

＠Altera
Driving that girl into a corner is bad civilization.[sr]It cannot possibly be good civilization.

[charaFace F 4]

＠Altera
Even if this cold world demands the sacrifice of one to allow one billion to live...

＠Altera
Even if continuous development is a direct attack on the old world, and a more dangerous option awaits you somewhere in your future...
[k]

[charaFace F 2]

＠Altera
The mere act of continuing to resist in itself should be great civilization!

Take my hand, Master of Chaldea! We shall form a contract, temporarily sharing magical energy!
