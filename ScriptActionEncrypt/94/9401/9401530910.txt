Now that we've failed to cheese her, she'll be much more alert than she was before. We should assume we won't get another shot at taking her out.

Oh, she'll also probably start trying to root out the culprits and make an example of them. You know, grisly executions and such. Pretty standard stuff with your typical tyrannical despot.

I was surprised too. So much so that I even[sr]looked up from the book of the gods.

＠Enkidu
But I'm not surprised that your assassination attempt failed. What I am surprised by is Medb's self-control in overcoming her weakness.
[k]

＠Enkidu
I thought she was the type to trust her natural abilities so much that she would never bother with further training, but clearly I was wrong.

Of course, assassinating Medb would have just sidestepped all that entirely and gone straight to tearing down the whole prison.

I sense the barrier's origin in a stone located somewhere high above the ground.
[k]

＠Enkidu
It seems to be a control device. And because of how powerful the barrier it emits is, its control spell is actually quite simple.
[k]

＠Enkidu
I don't see any supplementary power units anywhere, so I think that just turning this device off should let you shut down the barrier.
