All set?[sr]Then let's get going to the boss fight!
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Or should I say, princess rescue mission?[sr]If all goes well, you'll be handsomely rewarded.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
You'll get a ton of Sakurament, and I'll have one less job to worry about. Everybody wins.
[k]

？1：Onward! To the front side!
？2：Time to rescue Passionlip.

...What's going on here? Some kind of limit on the number of people that could use that not-at-all-suspicious item of yours or something?

Heh heh heh. Even alone and outgunned, you're ready to let fly with the snark.

Not that I'd expect anything less from an Alter who's just so...INTO that Evil alignment of his. I'm a fan, you know.

Really? Spare me the crap. We're nothing alike, and that you'd even say that is worth a laugh.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I don't have any hidden aspects. What you see is what you get. I kill because I have to.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I don't sympathize with my victims. I don't toy with them. I gave up that conflicted, sadistic crap you love back when I was alive.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Emiya Alter
...So what's your offer? You kept me here because you have something you want from me, and something you think I want from you, right?

...You're quick on the uptake, aren't you.[sr]Good. It'll keep things easier down the road.

＠BB
I WAS planning to use this chance to squish a B-rank Servant, but you seem like you could be useful.
[k]

＠BB
So I'll give you a chance to survive.[sr]To put it bluntly...
[k]

[charaFace C 12]
＠BB
I want you to betray Chaldea and follow my orders instead.
[k]

＠BB
Kill every surviving human on SE.RA.PH, and capture[sr][%1].
[k]

＠BB
Do that, and you'll learn the truth about SE.RA.PH. That's part of your job as a Counter Force Guardian, right?

I like the way you think, BB. I was just getting fed up with keeping those goody two-shoes safe.
