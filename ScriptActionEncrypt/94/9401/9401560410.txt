＠Mash
...I wonder how much time has passed...
[k]

＠Mash
It feels like it was only yesterday...[sr]Then again, it feels like ten years have passed.
[k]

＠Mash
Ever since “that person” from the distant land was defeated, Bunyan expanded the city in a fervor.
[k]

＠Mash
She chopped down trees, broke up mountains, and changed the course of the river. It was as if the city of Chicago was moving, like a living being.

＠Mash
The people who gathered came from various places eventually grew to number in the hundreds of thousands, and in time created a megalopolis.
[k]

＠Mash
Chicago's eastern end had already crossed the Atlantic Ocean, reaching the Iberian Peninsula, while the western end reached Japan's Nerima District.
[k]

＠Mash
Master and I have been in this city the whole time.[sr]I feel we've been enjoying our stay here.
[k]

＠Mash
Except for Edison...who has been cooped up in a laboratory at the Japanese pavilion.

A goddess who is a symbol for the United States.[sr]She is related to the Roman goddess Libertas.

＠Geronimo
Rather than being a deity for worship, she's more like a personification of the nation. Like Uncle Sam.

Edison and I were investigating the truth behind this world and Bunyan...

His Spiritual World Communicator opened up the door to this world, and the giant Spirit Bunyan is the core of this world. Am I correct?

If your theory has gotten you this far, I suppose there's no need to hide it any longer.
[k]

＠Goddess Columbia
Have you not noticed? This place is not a Singularity that the other Master created.
[k]

＠Goddess Columbia
This world is Paul Bunyan's own consciousness.[sr]It is similar to what you call a Reality Marble...

Impossible. Paul Bunyan's Spirit Origin could not possibly maintain a Reality Marble of this caliber.

＠Geronimo
Living beings exist in this world.[sr]Sentient people are living day-by-day here.
[k]

＠Geronimo
It's neither a dream nor illusion. This world is real. It exists. So you're saying it's a Reality Marble that can contain something of that sort?

[charaFadein F 0.1 1]

You know perfectly well of just what could make that possible.
[k]

？1：A Grail!

？！

＠Goddess Columbia
Which means that the nameless Master turned out to be a formidable Master, after all.
[k]

＠Goddess Columbia
That Master possessed a Grail.[sr]And mixing it with udon dough...created Bunyan.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Goddess Columbia
The Third Magic that can grant any wish...[sr]That Master did not understand the meaning of it at all.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Goddess Columbia
The Grail's wish was distorted by the udon dough, which is how Bunyan manifested.

[charaTalk F]
[charaFace F 0]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]

＠Goddess Columbia
Correct, Medicine Man...wise one.[sr]It is the memory of the States.
[k]

＠Goddess Columbia
Because it's a memory, it was warped into something ideal, into a mere fleeting dream.
[k]

＠Goddess Columbia
That other Master meant to seal Bunyan in here.[sr]But the opposite happened. It brought her here as well.
[k]

＠Goddess Columbia
Bunyan possesses an infinite potential for destruction and creation. It's potential the United States as a nation has in itself.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Goddess Columbia
Thus, Bunyan will continue to shape and develop this world... And once it reaches its limit, all will be destroyed.

[charaFadein F 0.1 1]

＠Goddess Columbia
Correct. Though it was a futile effort.[sr]This loop is already at its 12,520th cycle.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Goddess Columbia
And now that you have given Bunyan an axe, the cycle of creation and destruction has resumed.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Goddess Columbia
And Bunyan has seen outside this world. She has seen your Chaldea through that Spirit World Communicator.
[k]

？1：No... That can't be...

？！

＠Goddess Columbia
Yes. At this rate, Bunyan's world will begin to encroach upon your world as well.
[k]

＠Goddess Columbia
The humanity that you all worked hard to restore will tolerate even a fabricated Heroic Spirit like Bunyan.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Goddess Columbia
And as such, some manner of chaos must ensue.
[k]

？1：Now you mention it, everyone was going bonkers...

[charaFace F 0]

＠Goddess Columbia
Exactly.[sr]Do you understand now, Master of Chaldea?

？2：I'm going to free Mash, the others, AND Bunyan!

＠Goddess Columbia
...I see. I knew you would say that, Master of Chaldea... Strong one.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Goddess Columbia
Then I have no choice. I must destroy you, then remake you to incorporate you all into this world.

[charaFace F 2]
