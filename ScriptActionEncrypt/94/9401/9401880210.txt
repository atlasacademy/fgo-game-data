＠Altera Santa
We are sinking through the underworld's night sky... Strange and even contradictory as that might seem,[sr]I find it rather beautiful. Almost poetic.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
And there's this dark gold dust. I doubt it serves as currency here, but it IS tinged with magical energy.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I bet I could make a lot of presents if I collected it.[sr]It's like this world was made for Christma[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Altera Santa
What's wrong, [%1]? I thought you would be happier now that we've finally reached the first gate.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_2 1.5]

？1：I mean, just take a look around.
？2：This isn't anything like the underworld I know!

I see from your expression that you are wondering why this place is so “rocking.”

Let's see, what did he say to do in these situations...[sr]Oh, right. I need to read this letter.

Ahem-hem. Ho ho ho![sr]Listen well, young [%1].

＠Mysterious Letter
“Christmas has never been bigger here!”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“Why, you ask? Because our underworld is merging with Chaldea's accumulated knowledge.”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“And why is THAT happening?[sr]I'm afraid that is a secret, so no specifics!”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“But I cannot hide anything from Santa Claus,[sr]so I will tell you what I can.”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“I took the liberty of paring things down to the basics to save time.”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“Now that the oath of the goddess is broken, the underworld has gone crazy! Even the very concepts of time and place are all wonky!”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“This is all Chaldea's fault, so it should be fixed if we blow Chaldea up.”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“But that would be so much trouble, so a plague is a nice compromise. It's also a more reasonable and, dare I say, economical use of godly power.”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“I basically want to get rid of everyone who knows about Kur. Does that sound okay to you?”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“Please forward all your thoughts, concerns, or complaints to the underworld temple. I will happily respond to each with a present.”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“Re-sheep-fully Yours”

[charaFace A 9]

＠Altera Santa
What a wonderfully comprehensible letter.[sr]I knew I could count on the spirit of Christmas.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Altera Santa
...There you have it, [%1].[sr]Now you know our great secret.
[k]

？1：What do you know about that letter's writer?
？2：Does that letter say anything else?

？！

＠Altera Santa
Let me see...[sr]Yes, it DOES say something else. Here it is.
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“PS - At this time of year, the underworld is narrow and deep, not wide and shallow.”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“This means that its seven gates are now seven layers, and at the very bottom, beyond even the seventh layer, lies something truly special...”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“...the ocean of pure water that serves as the root of Sumerian myth. Originally called 'the Abzu.' Today people often refer to it as 'the abyss.'”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“In the dark reaches of its depths lies the underworld's temple...”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“Anyway, that's where the Queen of Kur is, and Chaldea won't cool down until she's defeated.”
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“So if you want to save Chaldea,[sr]you should head for the abyss.”
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Altera Santa
...There you have it. It sounds like this Queen of Kur person is the problem.
[k]

？1：So...Uruk in Abyss, eh?

[charaFace A 9]

＠Altera Santa
You really wanted to say that, hm? I understand.
[k]

？2：So, the abyss is below the underworld?

[charaFace A 8]

＠Altera Santa
There's a proviso included here.
[k]

＠Mysterious Letter
“It'll help to think of it as the underworld existing right in the center of the abyss.”
[k]

＠Altera Santa
So, I suppose that would mean there's a shallow abyss, and a deep abyss...?
[k]

＠Altera Santa
I must say, navigating the weird spaces of the Age of Gods is a bit beyond me...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Altera Santa
Getting around is so much simpler on the surface. Up there, it's easy to tell how close or far you are from something when you're just walking about.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Altera Santa
At any rate, now we know exactly where we need to go.[sr]Any other questions? Ask, and I shall answer.
[k]

？1：Okay, I think I understand now. So, uh...about you...

？！

？1：What does all this have to do with you?

＠Altera Santa
I am here for the dream collaboration of the Mesopotamian underworld and Christmas. Together, we have crossed mythological lines all at once!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Altera Santa
Santa was never connected to the underworld at all. Actually, neither were the Huns, now that I think about it...
[k]

＠Altera Santa
No matter! Wherever there are people crying out for presents, there must be a Santa to deliver them. Or, that's what I was told...
[k]

＠Altera Santa
At any rate, I have presents I need to deliver to the abyss, so I will go with you.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_7 3.0]

＠Altera Santa
...I would like to tell you more,[sr]but I can already see the first gate.
[k]

＠Altera Santa
Be on your guard, [%1]. There's a gatekeeper here, just like I heard there would be.

I'm amazed to see intruders so brazen as to attack from the sky. Are you idiots, or just braindead?

＠Gatekeeper
Whichever it is, this is where your journey ends.[sr]Kur is full of souls, and the living are unwelcome.

＠Altera Santa
Still, a Heroic Spirit essentially IS a soul, so I should be fine. As for [%1] here...
[k]

＠Altera Santa
[&His:Her] soul is so courageous [&he:she] may as well have actually died at least once, so [&he:she] should be fine, too.

You have no right to pass, nor have you met the conditions to open this gate.

Unfortunately, that premise is no longer the one on which these gates operate.

＠Gatekeeper
It is no longer a question of fairness, which is a trial that anyone could potentially succeed in.
[k]

＠Gatekeeper
Now there is a single condition that must be satisfied to open this gate: something must be sacrificed.
[k]

＠Gatekeeper
Do you understand? If you wish to proceed from here, you must either suffer defeat at my hands, or...

Christmas is all the rage in the underworld right now.[sr]I even hear that Santa Claus is coming to town.

And surely Santa must have butter cake, the most amazing of all treats in Uruk.

[charaFace C 5]

If you don't, then go home and stop wasting my time.
