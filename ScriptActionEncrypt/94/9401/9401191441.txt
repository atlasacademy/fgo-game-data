You're our hero, our savior! I'm thrilled to have met such a brave soul! And one so young too!

＠Man
Judging from your uniform...you must be from Chaldea![sr]Then you DID get my distress signal!
[k]

？1：Uh, yes, we did.
？2：Yes, I'm here from Chaldea.

？！

＠Man
I knew it! I'm Arnold, secretary to the director of Seraphix. ...A government official, basically.
[k]

＠Man
So how is the rescue proceeding?[sr]Is this digitization thing finally over?

Thanks. It hasn't been easy, but as you can see,[sr]I'm still alive.

The key thing to do in an emergency is to stay calm, examine your surroundings, assess the situation, and believe in yourself.

＠Arnold
Do that, and you can make it out of even the most dire of situations.

There were two others besides me not too long ago...[sr]One of them was rather timid by nature.

She tried to run many times, and many times I talked her out of it. But in the end she gave in to her fear and fled. I doubt she's still alive.

[%1], time is of the essence.[sr]Let us return to our investigation.
[k]

＠Gawain
First, we should look over the Seraphix records being kept here in the Command Room.
[k]

＠Gawain
After that... the planetarium. I thought it would be near here, but I cannot find it anywhere.
[k]

＠Gawain
If it is in another area, perhaps we can find it by searching nearby routes.

[k]

＠Arnold
And what's this about a planetarium? There's no place like that! If there was, I'd know about it!
[k]

＠Arnold
You need authorization from the director of Chaldea, the head of the Animusphere family, in order to see Seraphix's records.
[k]

＠Arnold
You can't go looking through them just because you're the rescue team.

Some time ago, we survivors came together to form a colony here.
[k]

＠Arnold
At that time, we had someone from the church who commuted here to provide therapy to those in need of it.
[k]

＠Arnold
I didn't see the need for it myself, but many of the others were religious. Unfortunately...

？1：...What about that Demon God Pillar?

？！

＠Arnold
Demon God Pillar? Is that what that monster was called? That was the final nightmare.
[k]

＠Arnold
One day, it sprung up out of the floor, killed the people who had murdered the doctors, then absorbed their bodies.
[k]

＠Arnold
But that was all. It was creepy, of course, but as long as we kept our distance, it left us alone.
[k]

＠Arnold
We were still terrified of it, naturally, but we had no choice but to stay put here and make do.

＠Gawain
I agree. Our journey here may have been in vain, but at least we have rescued Arnold.

＠Gawain
Furthermore, Lady Mable and Tristan are at the church.[sr]We should consult with them as well.
[k]

？2：You know, that Demon God Pillar was kind of...off.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Gawain
Indeed. Despite its appearance and power, it was not the sort of Demon God Pillar we are familiar with.
[k]

＠Gawain
It seemed...empty, somehow.[sr]As though it lacked a soul.
