A rip-off? Don't be silly. That was 100% a Celtic design. Make no mistake about it.

Now then...the warden's day starts bright and early. I don't know exactly when she gets up, but it MUST be early because she's always yawning.

She's the prison warden AND the queen of Connacht, so Medb is definitely the busiest person in the country.
[k]

＠
Her time sleeping in this very bed to rest up from her exhausting days is a critical part of her routine!
[k]

＠
She never deviates from that routine. She even wears the same thing every day. What does she wear to bed? Why, Gabrielle No. 5, of course.
[k]


＠
First thing every morning, she changes out of that.[sr]In other words, she takes her morning shower.

But, since always wearing her formal attire would end up making it a bit less special, she makes sure to put on a coat over it before heading out for the day.

So, humming to herself all the while, she pulls her coat around her shoulders and orders her men to go about their preparations for the day.
