[charaFace E 13]
＠Mash
Yes, Senpai.

？2：Noted. So, what does the Doctor say?

[charaFace E 7]
＠Mash
The Doctor is here too, but he's a little busy at the moment!
[k]

＠Mash
So I will relay the message for now!
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 7]
＠Mash
...And that was the report on the summoning experiment, and the analysis on this unexpected incident.
[k]

＠Mash
The situation is not resolved yet. We can't let our guard down.

[charaFace E 12]

However, I'm surprised... To think there would be this much time lag between us!

I'm still detecting Servant readings around the Flaming Mountains. I even picked up traces of potent Ether.

＠Dr. Roman
I suspect some kind of crazy experiment with magecraft. It must've been conducted by a high-ranking Caster as well.
[k]

？1：That's probably...
？2：A mage that can hover over the Flaming Mountains?
