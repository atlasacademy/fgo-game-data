...No. I...should be the one thanking you.[sr]I was the reason we got into that mess to begin with...
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Hmm. Now that we have the opportunity, let me ask you. Why were you surrounded by them back there?
[k]

[charaTalk E]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I was...summoned to this island not long ago.[sr]I don't know the reason...but I can speculate.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
[line 2]It's the oni. It's because I...am a Heroic Spirit deeply connected with oni.
[k]

？1：What do you mean by that?
？！

[charaTalk E]
[charaFace E 4]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
A secret technique of the Fuuma... is to turn into an oni. That is why... there are tales of me... as an oni.

...Not as of this moment.[sr]That Noble Phantasm is sealed.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
However... There were oni right in front of my eyes.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I thought if I could observe them, study them up close, I might be able to absorb their behaviors and unleash my Noble Phantasm...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Now I know it was a mistake. One group of oni called in another, and that turned into a chain reaction[line 2]
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
And things ended up like that.
[k]

[charaTalk E]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I haven't even fully grasped the layout of the island yet...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
It was a reckless move for me to make... Usually someone else would do the scouting for me...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
So I'm not used to doing it myself...[sr]I feel so embarrassed right now...

So what if you lost your way?[sr]Speaking of which, I got lost too!

Oh...um, I'm honored...to hear you say that, Kintoki.

(He's becoming even more embarrassed...)
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
That's right, thank you Kintoki.[sr]You really saved us out there.
[k]

[charaTalk F]

＠Sakata Kintoki
Nah, I didn't do anything for you to thank me, Doc.[sr]I just enjoyed blowing them away with my ride.
[k]

We're out of trouble for the time being, but we're simply back to where we started.

＠Mash
What is with this Onigashima? What is up with the oni? The mystery still remains.
[k]

[charaTalk B]

＠Dr. Roman
Precisely. Kintoki, Kotarou. Our purpose here is to solve the mystery behind this island.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
I realize I'm asking you this again, but will you help us?

＠Sakata Kintoki
You're already my comrades and riding buddies. Once your butt is on my machine, we go all the way together.
[k]

＠Sakata Kintoki
But just like I said with those oni[line 2] I'm not responsible for what happens to you if you fall off!

As Kintarou, if I don't hunt oni, then what am I doing here? Well, I guess I could ride my bike!

Yes, of course. You are one of my ancestor's... Minamoto-no-Raikou's Four Heavenly Kings! The brave exploits of Kintoki are renowned!
[k]

＠Ushiwakamaru
There is nothing more heroic than the tales that were made by Kintarou of Mt. Ashigara!

I read all of your stories back in Chaldea!

Ehh...well, all I did was go wild with my boss...

＠Sakata Kintoki
You lookin' at me like that is kinda embarrassing. But if my old boss is your ancestor, then you're a Minamoto too?

Kintoki started blushing and turned away.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
His hair is different and he's riding a motorcycle, but he's not any different than the usual Kintoki.
[k]

＠Dr. Roman
Most of all, he's still a companion that we can rely on. Anyway, I'd like you to start by gathering information[line 2]
