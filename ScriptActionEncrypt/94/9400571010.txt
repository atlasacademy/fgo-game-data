＠Tamamo-no-Mae
Here we are! It's “Let's Make Our Lives Easier: Part 3”!

[charaFace D 1]
＠Tamamo-no-Mae
As such, let's build a bridge, Master!
[k]

＠Tamamo-no-Mae
We Servants can leap over rivers or ravines in a single huge bound, so this idea was conceived with you in mind, Master!
[k]


？1：It certainly would help a lot.
？2：Taking the long way round is such a pain.
？！

＠Scáthach
Well, now that we have a great road, it would be much more efficient if we built a bridge connected to the places hard to reach for you.

＠Kiyohime
There are lots of beautiful bridges in Japan.[sr]Maybe we should build a wooden one similar to those?

Master and I on a beautiful bridge... Slowly, silently we walk... Our hands touch... We stare at each other and... Tee hee.

＠Altria
Japanese bridges, hmm? I admit they are beautiful, but I somehow picture them to be fragile.
[k]

＠Altria
So I suggest we mainly make one out of stone.[sr]A combined stone gate and drawbridge will give us the perfect defense.

Wow, Father just said what I would have suggested... Heh heh.

＠Mordred
N-No! I counter that opinion for the sake of stirring things up!

＠Mordred
Nobody will be satisfied with a plain old bridge like that. It's time to take advantage of Scáthach's skills again.
[k]

＠Mordred
Let's look at things differently. Why stick to a bridge?[sr]All the thing needs to do is let us cross a river and such.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Mordred
Which is why I'm suggesting[line 2]a ropeway!
