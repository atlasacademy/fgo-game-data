Now then, it is about time for[sr]the next oni guard to appear.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠General Setsubun
But rest assured you have nothing to fear, Master.
[k]

＠General Setsubun
I WAS concerned about what effect the alcohol fumes may have on me, but thus far there seems to have been none.

And yet, it is always when things seem to be going smoothly that the ground falls from beneath your feet.

I have been on my guard as well,[sr]but one can never be too careful.
[k]

？1：Are you okay?
？！

[charaFace E 1]

＠Hapless Shrine Ninja
Your kind consideration warms my heart, Master.
[k]

＠Hapless Shrine Ninja
If it is my appearance that concerns you, then worry not. I am a kunoichi and a shrine maiden[line 2]a shrine ninja, if you will. And alcohol is a key to many divine rites.
[k]

＠Hapless Shrine Ninja
I may be small in stature, but I assure you that I can endure alcoholic fumes as well as anyone.

＠Mash
It seems like the intoxication and exhaustion effects of climbing this tower...
[k]

＠Mash
...may not have much to do with how old each Servant appears to be.
[k]


＠Mash
If they did, then Servants like Jack and Nursery would presumably tire out quickly...
[k]

＠Mash
...but based on the data I've seen so far,[sr]that doesn't seem to be the case.

I am afraid that such things tend to fly over my head,[sr]so I shall let you do the heavy thinking.

＠Hapless Shrine Ninja
If I recall correctly, this tower was created[sr]by Shuten-Douji using her Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Hapless Shrine Ninja
As such, its effects may well differ from Servant to Servant.
[k]

＠Hapless Shrine Ninja
Perhaps that is due to the affinity or bond she has with a given Servant...
[k]

＠Hapless Shrine Ninja
Indeed, speaking of bonds, being inside this tower inspires strange feelings within me.
[k]

＠Hapless Shrine Ninja
Something familiar, even nostalgic. Something nice, and something cursed at the same time...

[k]

＠Gorgon
Of course, I am under no obligation to help her, but I do enjoy the demonic aura that permeates this tower.[sr]It simply drips with poison.
[k]

＠Gorgon
For me, being in this tower is much like...
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

Wh-why would you call me that!?[sr]That was just mean!
[k]

＠Hapless Shrine Ninja
Besides, you have plenty of attributes yourself, seeing as you are a widow, a horned creature, a hakama wearer, AND a bowless Archer all in one!

Oh my, I'm so sorry. It just slipped out.[sr]You're right, I am in no position to judge others...

I believe that woman is the source of the smell I've noticed on this floor. I apologize for my impudence, but I cannot leave her behind.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

＠Hapless Shrine Ninja
I can tell she is very...twisted?[sr]Perhaps even cursed?
[k]

＠Hapless Shrine Ninja
Whatever her manner of ailment, I simply cannot look the other way... As such, I would like to talk to her, if at all possible.
[k]

＠Hapless Shrine Ninja
I understand this is a selfish request,[sr]one completely unbefitting a shinobi, and yet...

I had no intention of serving as a guard, but I feel almost as if our meeting here was fated.

＠Gorgon
All of this is to say that I have no intention of standing idly by and letting you pass.
[k]

？1：Huh? Why not?
？2：I thought you just liked being in this tower?
？！

[charaFace F 1]

＠Gorgon
Oh, it's simple really. I love nothing more than tormenting weaklings and hearing their pathetic screams.

Just because I'm soaking in what feels like a hot spring to me doesn't mean I've gone at all soft.
