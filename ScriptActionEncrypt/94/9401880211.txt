It's stamped with the official seals of the first and second Chaldean Santas. That masked man with a kind voice said as much, too.

I'd heard the gates of the underworld were gates of judgment, and didn't open except for the dead...

Her soul ascended to heaven when she got a present.[sr]So that is a Christmas miracle...

I knew I was right to seek you out, Master.[sr]I'm guessing you have the right idea.

The underworld is supposed to be freezing cold, but my heart couldn't be warmer right now.

That makes our objective all the clearer.

＠Altera Santa
We will descend deeper from here, find the next gate, and give a present to its gatekeeper.

As long as we keep that up, we're sure to reach the abyss. This is a difficult assignment for my first time, but I won't give up!
