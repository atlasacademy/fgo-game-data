＠
A hundred days without change[sr]might as well be a single day.
[k]

＠
And yet, in all my life,[sr]I never realized that.
[k]

＠
It's been so long since I took up residence in[sr]Himeji Castle. What was I like before I lived here?
[k]

＠
Was I a fox? A bat?[sr]Something else entirely?
[k]

＠
The seemingly infinite realm of Mystics faded away.[sr]All those I was close to disappeared one by one.
[k]

＠
It would have upset me greatly if they had been killed, but they kind of just faded away, which made their disappearance easier to accept.
[k]

＠
I think...yes, I'm sure I remember that once I even gave a katana to someone named Musashi, and got in a ton of trouble for it.
[k]

＠
Still, I really enjoyed the night I spent with that swordmaster. She was an eccentric who actually enjoyed hearing me babble on and on about my hobbies.
[k]

＠
I don't remember any other visitors besides her. There must have been others, but none that stuck with me.
[k]

＠
My memories are all a haze. So many days spent with no purpose, no meaning... Perhaps all I'm really doing is taking up space.
[k]

＠
The worst part is that it doesn't bother me.[sr]Not to say that I enjoy it...
[k]

＠
But...it definitely doesn't bother me, either.[sr]Maybe it would if I tried to change things.
[k]


＠
So, every time I think I'll convince myself to change, I end up chickening out.
[k]

＠
All I do is play about with tiny, meaningless changes before I put things back just as they were.
[k]

＠
And even that doesn't bother me.[sr]I'll take that any day over being scared.
[k]

＠
If this were to go on forever...I think I'd be okay with that.
[k]

＠
Even if someone did summon me out of here as a Servant, I'd be too terrified to do anything.
[k]

＠
I mean, I'm just not the type to put myself on the line. What possible use could I be? Saving the world? That's way over my head.
[k]

＠
I'm just plain old Osakabehime.

Wrong. My main body requires a large number of[sr]Elisa Particles in order to function.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II
As of now, it's little more than a glorified missile silo.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II
According to my calculations, providing the guardian statue with a single Servant's worth of Elisa Particles...
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II
...will enable it to remove Csejte Pyramid Himeji Castle from history.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II
That way, your wish of shutting yourself in forever will come true. You'll have plenty of time to worry about whatever you want after that.
[k]

＠Mecha Eli-chan Mk. II
You'll have all the time in the world to indulge yourself in your lazy, NEETy ways.
