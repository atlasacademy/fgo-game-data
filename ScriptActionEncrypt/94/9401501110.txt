Yes, I do. Given your pride, earnest nature, and sense of responsibility...

＠Caster of Storytelling

Therefore, I am left with no choice but to activate the Legend's Full Spike Mode.

It is designed to let it cling to the ground in case of avalanches and landslides. We must proceed first and foremost with caution.

What's this!? We're still at the very beginning of the second area, but one team's already lagging behind!

Meanwhile, the other teams' vehicles are neck and neck with Boudica's chariot!

＠Ishtar Commentary
At this point, let me offer the same advice I gave in the first area.
[k]

＠Ishtar Commentary
If you get crushed by a boulder or melted by lava, walk it off! You'd better make sure that each and every one of you makes it to the finish line!
