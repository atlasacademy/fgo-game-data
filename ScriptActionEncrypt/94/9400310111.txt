Enemy Servant eliminated. The battle is over.
[k]

？1：That was a pretty easy win.
？2：That was pretty weak for a Servant...

？！

＠El-Melloi
That was just one of the many Assassins. As you've seen, that Assassin has the ability to split and manifest multiple bodies.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
That's why the fight is not over yet.[sr]We must prepare for the next encounter.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Do you mean a single Heroic Spirit has the ability to manifest as a group?
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Not only is it a fearsome ability to use in espionage, unless one has an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm, it means that Assassin can overwhelm any opponent with sheer numbers alone.

＠El-Melloi
Humph, but now that I've mastered Qi Men Dun Jia, they'll just end up as my prey.

＠El-Melloi
They'd have to keep the entire Fuyuki area under surveillance for the time being. That said, they can't exactly ignore us either.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Assassin will most likely keep sending people to attack us.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠El-Melloi
As a result, they have broken the golden rule of military strategy by continuously investing their combat personnel without reserve. How very sad, indeed.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠El-Melloi
We'll have to fight them one after another, but they shouldn't pose too much of a threat.
[k]

＠El-Melloi
Just take them out the minute you lay eyes on them. Now then, there's no time to waste. Onward I say! Onward!

Fou?

Huh? But...
[k]

？1：Aren't you going to give us an explanation now?
？2：What the heck is even going on right now?

Apologies, but it will have to wait. I'm not trying to be pompous, it's just we're in a race against time.

＠El-Melloi
Oh, don't make that face. I'll explain as many things as[sr]I can on our way, starting with the most vital matters.
