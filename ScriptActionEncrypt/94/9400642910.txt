I had a meeting with Da Vinci and we came up with an engineering solution.

That world is very dangerous.[sr]But we've become very involved with it.

At this point, we're a part of this too.[sr]We can't just ignore it.

[communicationCharaFace 0]
＠Da Vinci
They have overwhelming magical energy, and sometimes can use magecraft intuitively, and without the proper rituals.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But for those who lose their possibilities and give in to despair, their obsession becomes a flow of unformed magical energy.

You guys have done all kinds of things that I thought were impossible.

You can't make a miracle happen if you're worried about safety, efficiency, or a plan B.
