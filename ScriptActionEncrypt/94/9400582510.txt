＠Kiyohime
Wow...Thank you, Master.[sr]It's a soothing, simple watercourse.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
And there is a small waterwheel, too...

＠Mash
So it's a system that turns the water's moving energy into rotational energy semi-permanently.
[k]

＠Mash
It's simple, but amazing.
[k]


？1：Technology that's been used for thousands of years...

＠Mash
Yes. It's like I can actually see human knowledge take shape. I may be exaggerating a bit.
[k]


？2：I wonder who was the first one to invent it?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
...Sorry, I don't know.[sr]Who could it be?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
When we return to Chaldea, I will thoroughly search the database...
[k]

＠Mash
And hand in a well-organized and comprehensive report. I promise!
[k]

？！

＠Kojirou
I am the son of a farmer.[sr]Even my village had a waterwheel.
[k]

＠Kojirou
I had no special feelings for it back then, but now that I hear it in a deserted tropical island like this...
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Kojirou
I never expected it could be so refined.

I don't care if you think it's refined or elegant, but I was enjoying a moment of relaxation with Master.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
The more people disturb us, the less cozy I can get with Master. Hurry up, do your business, and go away.

＠Kojirou
I have no business. I simply came over attracted to this sound.
[k]

＠Kojirou
Mash and Master. I won't say it is a bad thing to admire the handiness of waterwheels or their history.
[k]

＠Kojirou
But it is also good to simply close your eyes and lend your ears to the splashing sound of water and creaking lumber.

Of course. I just came up with a haiku: At the bottom right / Continuously running / The creature sprints on.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Kojirou
Ah yes, how elegant. The first line “At the bottom right” seems meaningless, but it actually displays my remarkable poetic sense. Heh heh.
