＠Longsword Swordsman
Distinguished elder.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
Surely it is too soon for you to coop yourself up here in Reigandou. I can see you are fairly withered, but you cannot be older than sixty at most.
[k]

＠Old Man
...Seems my destiny has finally arrived.[sr]You're late.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
I am very sorry.[sr]But I am glad to see I am not too late.
[k]

＠Old Man
You're well past “too late.” I can feel death reaching out for me even now. It's reached the point where I'm thinking about my mother.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
Thinking back on your mother? Haha, you are a deal more softhearted than I had thought, Lord Shinmen Musashi.
[k]

＠Old Man
You watch your mouth.
[k]

＠Old Man
At any rate, it's good of you to finally come. I've been awaiting you for so long. I never thought you would be the one to keep me waiting.
[k]

＠Old Man
Unfortunately, I'm afraid I cannot rid myself of my regrets. Look. These hands of mine can no longer hold two swords.
[k]

＠Old Man
I'm so sorry. Forgive me.[sr]Please forgive me...!
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
There is nothing to forgive.[sr]Please hold your head high, distinguished elder.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
I must say, you have chosen a wonderful hermitage. It's completely cut off from all the outside world's din.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
Were I to live a long life and grow old in peace, I believe I would choose just such a place as this little shrine for my last days. It is so quiet and peaceful.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
There's no hustle and bustle of the town to be heard.[sr]Only the slow passage of time.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
I see you have reached a state[sr]quite unlike the one I attained.
[k]

＠Old Man
Haha. Hahaha... Of all the things I thought you might say, praising my final resting place certainly wasn't one of them. You are terrible at giving compliments.
[k]

＠Old Man
Here, there is no time, no space,[sr]no fate, no good, and no evil.
[k]

＠Old Man
Iori is all grown up. He's carrying on for Mikinosuke admirably. I think he was a chief retainer for the daimyo, last I heard...
[k]

＠Old Man
I am going to die.[sr]That is why I have been waiting for you, my destiny.
[k]

＠Old Man
I must say, though...I've never seen such a handsome swordsman before.
[k]

＠Old Man
You look like a cool summer breeze made flesh and blood. Your swordsmanship must be beautiful to behold, my destiny.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
Beautiful, you say?
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
You are my superior in the art of giving[sr]compliments by far. I am but a simple eccentric.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
All I ever did was hide away in the mountains and spend my days by swinging my sword. I may be an eccentric swordsman, but I am a far cry from a swordmaster like you.
[k]

＠Old Man
“Swordmaster,” eh.[sr]Is that what some people call me...?
[k]

＠Old Man
Hmm, now that you mention it, I suppose I ran into a few of them myself at some point...
[k]

＠Old Man
Still...hehe, “master” is quite an exaggeration.[sr]I am nothing more than a washed-up old man.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
“Exaggeration”? You are THE Shinmen Musashi. You will certainly leave behind more than enough legends to earn the title of master.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
Miyamoto Musashi. Shinmen Musashi. There is not a swordsman alive who does not yearn to be you, and I have no doubt there will be many more to follow your footsteps.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
You will become a legend.[sr]I am sure of that much, if nothing else.
[k]

＠Old Man
...A legend, eh?
[k]

＠Old Man
I'm just an old man. I was wild and crazy in my youth,[sr]but in my old age, I tried to act a little wiser...
[k]

＠Old Man
But as you can see, in the end, I'm still[sr]just a shriveled up old man dying all alone.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
...
[k]

＠Old Man
Still, I suppose there were one or two people who reached out to me.
[k]

＠Old Man
There was the old monk who never met a lecture he didn't like. Oh, and a young man and woman who followed me around sometimes.
[k]

＠Old Man
...[sr]...
[k]

＠Old Man
Those people are why I'm still alive today.[sr]No one can survive all on their own, after all.
[k]

＠Old Man
Of course, by the time I realized that, I was already all alone... At any rate, that's all I had to say. Sorry to subject you to an old man's grumbling.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
I believe you are slightly off the mark there, distinguished elder.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
As you said, you raised Miyamoto Iori to be a fine young man, and you are leaving behind the Niten Ichiryu as your legacy.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
You may be alone here in Reigandou now, but stories of your life will continue to spread well after your death.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
Now that I have finally experienced this,[sr]I think I will go on ahead.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
All I have is my body and my techniques.[sr]Once I die, they'll both be as dust in the wind.
[k]

＠Old Man
...Stop that. Now YOU'RE the one sounding like an old man. I don't want to see you looking so forlorn.
[k]

＠Old Man
You give yourself far too little credit. You are a refined swordsman. You are the embodiment of the wind, and are more than worthy of being called my rival.
[k]

＠Old Man
Our duel was not to be in this life...
[k]

＠Old Man
But perhaps someday, in a different time and place...[sr]Ahh, if only this were hell.
[k]

＠Old Man
Then I could devour oni flesh, stand...and take up my blades!

＠Longsword Swordsman
I did duel Musashi, only moments ago.[sr]I saw for myself what Niten Ichiryu was capable of.

Oh, I must have lost consciousness.[sr]...So, I guess this means...that swordsman is gone?

＠Longsword Swordsman
Shinmen Musashi did indeed appear before me, and[sr]reached zero. I assure you, that is the truth.
[k]

＠Old Man
...
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_6 0.1]

＠Old Man
I see.
[k]

＠Old Man
...Then I shall take your word for it. I see.[sr]So, Musashi did reach the void, and came to know zero.
[k]

＠Old Man
That is...good to hear, Sasaki Kojirou, my destiny.
[k]

＠Old Man
Very...good to hear...indeed...
[k]

＠Old Man
Just what I needed...to put my soul at peace...

Farewell, my greatest rivals.[sr]I am grateful we had the chance to meet.

Even as we were never meant to.
