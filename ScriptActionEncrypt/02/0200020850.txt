Don't be ridiculous. The best rulers are those who know how to make use of their subjects. I take great pride in my choice of adjutants.

＠Assassin
Skilled underlings deserve to be valued[line 2]to be given the sort of work that suits those skills.
[k]

＠Assassin
I am an unrivaled judge of talent. I would go so far as to say that not even the great Qin Shi Huang or my ancestor, Liu Bang, can surpass me.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Assassin
Case in point: it was all thanks to Caster's clever planning that I was so easily able to drown those filthy rats in Ys. Hahaha!
[k]

？1：You must be the Caster Dahut mentioned.
？2：Dahut said something about you betraying her.
？！

[charaFace F 4]

...I'm afraid it's true.[sr]I did once serve Ys.

But, if I had stayed there, well...[sr]I didn't want to die, so...

Dahut pursued hedonistic pleasure to its absolute extreme. She never planned for the future, but always chose to live purely for the moment.

Caster tried to warn her over and over,[sr]but that lust-crazed wench refused to listen.

Whatever your original purpose in coming here, you should have seen enough of my city even before I granted you an audience to recognize its brilliance!

If anything, I would distrust the ones who don't. Evil should not be hidden. Crimes should not be covered up.

They should say something the moment they so much as sense wrongdoing afoot. That way, my loyal Torturers can take over and compel the offender to come clean.

[charaFadein E 0.1 1]

Never. That sort of thing only happens in other, lesser nations.
[k]

＠Assassin
In a truly just nation, one that holds itself to the highest standard, there can be no mistakes, and certainly no false accusations...
[k]

＠Assassin
...nor any who would misuse the reporting system for their own ends. Such things would simply never happen.
[k]

？1：Well they sure as hell exist here!

？！

＠Assassin
The Nightless City is still young.[sr]As such, some...growing pains are to be expected.
[k]

＠Assassin
But, as my methods spread and take root, this city will quickly grow closer to that ideal.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Assassin
Nonetheless, with all of that said, even you cannot deny that my city is far more peaceful and orderly than Ys or El Dorado.
[k]

＠Assassin
Surely you saw for yourselves how brightly it glitters? That is all the proof you could need to know that my reign is good and proper.
[k]

＠Assassin
Under my rule, evil will die out, the strong will assume responsibility and flourish, and the weak will serve as their foundation.
[k]

＠Assassin
What could possibly be wrong with that?[sr][charaFace E 1]Even a child could see the simple truth of this path!

Here, I'll spell it out for you: in a nation where everyone holds themselves to the highest standards, reporting wrongdoing is the perfect approach.
[k]

＠Assassin
With all of my subjects vigilant, there will be no tolerance for evil of any kind, no matter how small.
[k]

＠Assassin
Eventually, that approach will lead to the end of evil entirely.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

And so the goal of proper conduct is precisely what will set people on the correct path!

None of you has even the slightest self-control![sr]And it's not just you! All of humanity is like that!
[k]

＠Assassin
You all need to learn to endure the most arduous hardships. To work hard, and study with diligence!
[k]

＠Assassin
As long as one builds character like that, evil will never take root in their minds! In time, there will no longer be a need for transgressions to be reported!
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

And yet...
[k]

However, since I am nothing if not merciful, I shall call in my best Torturers, those who can compel anyone to speak the truth.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠Assassin
In effect, I shall make it easier for you to repent and confess your true feelings. Namely...
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Assassin
“I beg your forgiveness. Your Nightless City is actually super awesome. I was just so shy I couldn't come out and say that before.” Not that that will lessen the severity of your sentence, of course.
