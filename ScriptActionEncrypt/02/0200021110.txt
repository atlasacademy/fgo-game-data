This is purely hypothetical, so please feel free to answer it any way you like.

...What sort of nation would you like to live in?

[charaFace E 0]

...Why do you ask me?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Fergus
Well, to be blunt... Because you seem the most normal out of anyone here.
[k]

＠Fergus
After all, you're scared of both combat and dying, as most people would be.
[k]

＠Fergus
All of the other women here seem a bit...extreme, for lack of a better word.
[k]

＠Fergus
So I wanted to hear from one with more down-to-earth sensibilities.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Fergus
Of course, I'm well aware that there's no point to this question.

Even if we do arrive at the truth here, it wouldn't change anything, since Ulster is already gone.

I'd prefer not to talk about that.[sr]I would rather not dwell on those memories...

[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Scheherazade
...Oh, yes, my apologies. I'm afraid I don't have an especially interesting answer, but...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
...I would like to live in a nation without any danger. After all, in a place fraught with danger, it is possible I may lose my life.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Fergus
You really are afraid of dying, aren't you.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Scheherazade
...Isn't everyone...?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Fergus
Yes... I suppose they are. Regardless, a Celtic warrior does not fear death. You see[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Scheherazade
...
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Fergus
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to make small of your opinion. Maybe we should not talk about our views on the matter of life and death.
[k]

＠Fergus
It's not that we WANT to die, after all.[sr]I can certainly understand your position in that sense.
[k]

＠Fergus
Still...a nation without danger is easy to talk about, but probably very hard to create. The closest example I can think of is[line 2]
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Scheherazade
...The Land of the Young?
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Fergus
That's impressive. I should have expected as much from you. The Land of the Young, or Tír na nÓg, is a Celtic myth.
[k]

＠Fergus
It is a land of eternity, where gods and fairies walk.[sr]It is a peaceful and joyous utopia, where there is always enough delicious fruit for everyone to eat.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]
＠Scheherazade
Yet both there and here, the threat of death is still present.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Not gods who dwell underground, nor the humans in their peach-filled paradise, can escape it.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Fergus
True. That's why we've been drinking to our fallen comrades tonight.

...Oh, sorry to talk your ear off. I didn't mean to have you join me in my little mental exercise.

＠Fergus
By way of apology, how about this?
[k]

＠Fergus
I may not be able to help you live in a nation without the threat of death, but I can offer a replacement.

[charaFace E 0]

[charaFace D 0]

From now on, I won't just use my sword to protect[sr][%1].
[k]

＠Fergus
I'll also use it to keep you safe from the threat of death. On that, you have my word.
[k]

＠Fergus
I am young, inexperienced, and cannot draw my sword against a woman, but I should be better than nothing.

[charaFace E 3]
