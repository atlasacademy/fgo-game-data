Ha!

？1：She keeps firing at us from so far away!
？2：We can't get close enough to hit her!

？！

(She's ridiculously strong, too! I can only imagine beating her in one out of ten scenarios!)

(Well, guess that's better than with Lord Inshun. I had to imagine thirty scenarios to figure out how to beat him.)

＠Musashi
Still, it's tough going up against an archer when all you've got is katana! Especially one as skilled as she is!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Musashi
Sometimes she'll wreathe her arms in fire and try to punch me, but she mainly sticks to keeping her distance. It just isn't fair!

Save your whining for after I actually manage to hit you. It's so aggravating how you keep deflecting my arrows at the last instant.

Thanks! That's what my Niten Ichiryu is all about; snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, even if I'm outnumbered or outmatched!

＠Musashi
...Still, it's strange.
[k]

＠Musashi
You haven't used a weird barrier on me like Purgatorio did. Are you holding back or something?

＠Archer of Inferno
I'm impressed you realized. While I could easily kill many if I were to unleash my flame more freely...
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
...I have been told I must not do that, so I am indeed holding back. Forgive me, Shinmen Musashi.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Archer of Inferno
Ahh, how could I be so foolish... I was so eager[sr]to get started that I wasn't thinking straight.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
I must use all of my power to set a fire to you, and I desire that greatly. Yet that is not my purpose.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
I can't kill you here.[sr]I can't burn you alive just yet.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
...(Sigh) If only I'd done as I was told.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
Now I've even gone and forgotten the message I was supposed to give you. I just can't seem to keep my thoughts ordered...

＠Archer of Inferno
But I must take my leave, Shinmen Musashi.[sr]Farewell to you too, O precious Master of Chaldea.

She's completely vanished.[sr]Strange.

I wonder if it was some kind of sorcery. It definitely didn't seem like she was physically running away.

...Phew. At least it's over for now.

I'd hoped to take her down and cut their number from six to five, but I'm afraid it didn't work out that way.

And since we don't know where she ran off to,[sr]I guess this is as far as our duel goes tonight.

？1：We still need to keep our guard up.
？2：We should also rest up while we can.

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
I agree. The next time we meet,[sr]I'll make sure to finish the job.
[k]

＠Musashi
(...I'll need a way to defend against her flames.[sr]I sure can't just power through them.)
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Musashi
You know, I'm so used to dealing with stuff all on my own, I keep forgetting we can put our heads together![sr][%1], make sure you think of a way I can avoid getting burned!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
In the meantime, let's head back to Otama's room.
[k]

＠Musashi
The most important thing for us now is to get some sleep while we still can. You can't defeat demons if you're too tired to fight, after all.
