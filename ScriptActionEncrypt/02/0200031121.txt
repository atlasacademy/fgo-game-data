Does this mean that the heroes have won, and defeated[sr]the oni? I'm afraid I still don't fully understand.

＠Musashi
Oh, sorry if I confused you. I was just saying whatever came to mind. Don't dwell on it too much.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Musashi
Still, in the end: it doesn't really matter[sr]if you're a Heroic Spirit or an oni!
[k]

？1：That's a hell of a thing to say!
？2：It doesn't matter?

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
No, it doesn't. I may have plenty of opinions to share, but I still don't even know who I am!
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Musashi
I've been to many different worlds, fought opponents with the same name countless times...
[k]

＠Musashi
...and written something called the Book of Five Rings. But for all of that, I don't even know my own hometown.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Musashi
...If I'm being perfectly honest, I died back[sr]when I first wandered into a different world.
[k]

＠Musashi
I'm not the same person I was back then... I may even just be a ghost claiming to be Miyamoto Musashi.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Musashi
But even if I don't know who I am, there's one thing[sr]I can say for sure: at the very least, I'm no oni!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
And that's just as true for oni, too. Even if they don't know who they are, they can say this much for sure:
[k]

＠Musashi
“I am an oni.[sr]I'm a beast and I live my life accordingly.”
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Musashi
As long as you know that about yourself, that's all that matters. Even if you don't know who you really are...
[k]

＠Musashi
...or even if you've long since[sr]forgotten who you once were.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Musashi
As long as I decide how I want to live,[sr]and act accordingly, then I'm me!
[k]

＠Musashi
And I won't let anyone criticize me for that! Or, well,[sr]at least I'm not gonna criticize me for it right now!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
I guess what I'm trying to say is: right now, I'm someone who's here to fight bad guys with all of you.
[k]

＠Musashi
What about you, [%1]?
[k]

？1：...I want to save Onui and Tasuke.
？2：I'm here for them.

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Musashi
You got it. It doesn't matter who your family was, or where you came from. All that matters is what you want to do, and what you actually do!
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Musashi
So cheer up, Kotarou! Be honest: you felt bad for a moment earlier because you thought you were an oni just like them, didn't you!?

As far as [%1] and I are concerned, Kotarou, the fact that you're trying to save Onui and Tasuke makes you awesome.
[k]

＠Musashi
You're like a hero of justice straight out of a fairy tale. I've got a big soft spot for people like that.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Musashi
Me, I'm an underhanded coward who[sr]will do whatever it takes to win.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Musashi
I can't stand people who go around preaching justice, but I love people who try their best to do the right thing!
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Musashi
So hold your head high, Lord Kotarou.[sr]As long as you want to help others, I'll want to help you.
