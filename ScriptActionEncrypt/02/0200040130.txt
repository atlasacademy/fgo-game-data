In fact, this British settlement and France[sr]are currently at odds with one another.

＠Mata Hari
Only forty miles north, the French Army led Native Americans against a northern British colony, completely wiping it out.

[charaFace C 0]

＠Sanson
Naturally, the British retaliated, and the respective colonies ended up fighting a fearsome battle. The competition for resources is fierce between colonies. War is all but inevitable.

...Truth be told, my great-grandfather, the first head of our family, was part of the French Colonial Army himself.

He's completely right. I was thoughtless,[sr]and I put all my friends in danger.

Tituba cares a lot about being frugal, though I'm not sure why. Maybe it has to do with her own beliefs?

[charaFace E 10]

＠Abigail
So when she makes porridge, she'll water down[sr]the milk, and skimp a lot on the honey.
[k]

＠Abigail
I'm not sure if Uncle just doesn't mind, or if he likes how she saves him money, but he never says a word about it.

I don't remember seeing it myself...[sr]But I'm sure it must have been a wonderful sight.

Anyway, I'm sure Salem pales in comparison[sr]to someplace like Boston...
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

But even this town has a lot going for it.
[k]

＠Abigail
Uncle told me that its name comes[sr]from the word “Jerusalem.”
[k]

＠Abigail
You know all about Jerusalem, right?[sr]Every good Christian does.
[k]

＠Abigail
It's the holy city that was once ruled[sr]by both King David and King Solomon.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Abigail
The knights of the Crusades headed east to find it, but our Pilgrim Fathers set sail for the west instead.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Abigail
When they arrived at the New World, they founded[sr]the towns of Plymouth, Boston, and Salem!
[k]

＠Abigail
It must have been really hard when they first arrived, but now, ships come here from around the world!
[k]

＠Abigail
And you saw how big our rye fields are, right?[sr]Can you believe this all used to be woodland once?

＠Abigail
But if you insist, could you please help Tituba?[sr]She's not very good at defending herself.

＠Abigail
If Uncle gets forceful enough in his questioning,[sr]she might end up admitting to almost anything!

？！

？1：How do you feel about your uncle?

[charaFace E 0]

＠Abigail
Hmm... Uncle Carter's very responsible,[sr]and quiet, and strict.
[k]

＠Abigail
Everyone in the village is very pious, but I think they are also very stubborn, and they don't like to admit when they've made a mistake.
[k]

＠Abigail
But when Uncle starts talking to them in his calm voice, they always seem to accept what he says.
[k]

[charaFace H 13]

＠Mash
I see. So the other villagers[sr]really trust him, don't they?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

Yes, they do. He teaches at Harvard[sr]Divinity School in Boston, after all.
[k]

＠Abigail
He studies the Orient there.[sr]I don't really know quite what he researches...[charaFace E 10]
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Abigail
But he always has fascinating things[sr]to share about foreign countries.
[k]

＠Abigail
He's told me some really unusual stories about faraway lands like...the Qing dynasty, I think? And the Mughal Empire, and...a place called, uh...Zipang? They're all so fascinating.
[k]

＠Mash
I see. It sounds like your uncle is where your[sr]love of foreign countries came from, then.

[charaFace E 0]

I guess he must be.
[k]

[charaFace E 8]

＠Abigail
Well...[sr]I do love hearing stories like that, but...
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Abigail
...my very favorite thing is when I tell them to my friends, and let my imagination run wild.

＠Abigail
I especially enjoy telling them to Lavinia![sr]She's always so interested to hear them!

[charaFace H 0]

＠Mash
Lavinia...?[sr]Is that a friend of yours?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

Yes! She's the same age as me, so she was[sr]also born in the year of the comet.
[k]

＠Abigail
She's the best![sr]I always love talking with her!
[k]

＠Abigail
None of the other girls have much interest in foreign countries, so they only ever ask boring questions.

But Lavinia loves to read,[sr]so she knows all sorts of things.

＠Abigail
But she's still my best, most cherished friend.[sr]Being apart has helped me realize that.

I talked to Tituba about this,[sr]and she gave me some advice.
[k]

＠Abigail
She told me to be honest with myself, and think about whether I'd done something to hurt her without knowing or meaning to.
[k]

＠Abigail
She recommended I ask myself three questions.
[k]

？1：So, what were they?
？！

[charaFace E 10]

＠Abigail
First: Have I pretended to be someone I'm not?[sr]Second: Have I jumped to any conclusions about her?

And third: Have I been neglecting to pay attention to tomorrow because I'm still nursing a grudge from yesterday?
[k]

[charaFace H 7]

Tituba said that?[sr]...I see.

[charaFace E 4]
