It seems they've taken the men here as property.

Aha. So that's why they panicked and attacked you when they saw Fergus.

I mean, I can only guess whether it was the sort of concern they'd have about seeing a dangerous wild animal out of its cage...

He'd probably just say something like, “Every woman is beautiful in her own way. Is there a problem?”

I-I see... So this other me wouldn't even flinch in this situation. I admire his fortitude.
