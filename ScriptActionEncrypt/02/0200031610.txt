I...
[k]

＠
I'm looking up at the sky, even though I no[sr]longer have eyes to look, or a head to think...
[k]

＠
I wonder how this is possible.
[k]

...I can feel it. The kind of big blue[sr]sky I love is right there above me.

There, I see it.

[bgm BGM_EVENT_6 0.1]

＠
It's beautiful! So nice![sr]Oh, wait, is it beautiful, or just nice?
[k]

＠
Whatever.[sr]It doesn't matter.
[k]

＠
I'm feeling really good right now,[sr]so I'm just going to go with beautiful.
[k]

＠
The sunlight, the breeze... It's all perfect! It makes me want to spill everything I've been keeping to myself.
[k]

＠
Like... Yeah... Like what happened[sr]when I first came here to Shimousa...
[k]

＠
...when those creatures first showed up after I met Onui and Tasuke.
[k]

＠
If I'd been all alone...if Onui, Tasuke, and you hadn't been there...I probably would've just run away.
[k]

＠
Heck, I might not even have stopped[sr]until I'd reached Edo or Echigo.
[k]

＠
That's me! I'm Miyamoto Musashi, a woman always wandering from place to place!
[k]

＠
I'm nothing like the good guys in fairy tales who always do what's right. If anything, I'm closer to being a miscreant or a villain.
[k]

＠
Sure, if I see something unfair happening right in front of me, or a bunch of people about to get slaughtered, then I'm compelled to do something about it.
[k]

＠
But then, scrambling to deal with the fallout after you get caught up in trouble, well...
[k]

＠
It's a lot different from fighting over and over like this. I've never done that before.
[k]

＠
I love my life. Going wherever the wind takes me,[sr]with nothing but Lady Kannon's protection...
[k]

＠
But you know, [%1].
[k]

＠
I didn't dislike the constant fighting I did with[sr]you in Shimousa. If anything, I really liked it.
[k]

＠
After all...
[k]

＠
You say we do this to survive.[sr]That it isn't that big of a deal.
[k]

＠
But when I fought alongside you, I think...I was a swordsman who really fought for what's right. Someone who stood up to those with power, and helped those too weak to fight for themselves.
[k]

＠
I think it was your bravery that showed me the way. Without you, I'd never have made it through Shimousa.
[k]

＠
Ahh...it was wonderful.[sr]I had so much fun.
[k]

＠
It was way better than lying down watching the sky go by!
[k]

＠
I never imagined I'd ever get to experience so many wonderful things all at once!
[k]

＠
Hehe. Not to mention that in the end,[sr]I got to face off with my fated rival!
[k]

＠
A one-on-one duel with an incredible samurai. A fighter whose Origin is the opposite of mine, and whose sword contained infinite possibilities!
[k]

＠
...[sr]...
[k]

＠
...I can't thank you enough, [%1].[sr]I finally encountered my destiny.
[k]

＠
It was here that I reached the void...and obtained my zero sword.
[k]

＠
It's more than I could ever have hoped for.
[k]

＠
I only have two regrets.[sr]Yes, just two.
[k]

＠
First: I regret that I never got to eat lunch at Grandpa Muramasa's hermitage.
[k]

＠
Second: udon. Udon! In the end, I never[sr]got to try Shimousa's udon. Not even once.
[k]

＠
But, those things aside...everything else was perfect.
[k]

＠
I made it to the end.[sr]I gave it everything I had.
[k]

＠
I really pulled it off, [%1]!
[k]

＠
I wish I could tell you how grateful I am,[sr]just one more time.

If you like, you can stay here in town and ask the princess or Lady Otama for help whenever you need it. We've already talked to them, and they agreed.

Or, you can go back to the hermitage. I have no doubt that Lord Muramasa left you a nice nest egg.

The blue sky spread out above me...I looked up at the burned-out remains of Toke Castle.

＠
Onriedo Castle collapsed, and now only the wreckage of the old Toke Castle remains.
[k]

＠
Neither the castle walls with the creepy heartbeat, nor the pillars, were anywhere to be found. All the monster outbreaks were gone for good.
[k]

＠
Work on the castle's reconstruction had already begun. In fact, this area had been filled with people coming and going just a few moments ago.

I helped out a little, but I don't think I'll be able to stick around to the end.
