＠Mash (Narrator)
Monstrous tigers and leopards! Poisonous, wicked creatures! Evil spirits galore!
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Yes, a great many threats stood between Sanzang's party and their far-off destination of Tianzhu.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Of these, the most dangerous were enormous monsters known only as Demon Kings.
[k]

[charaFace F 7]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Then, one day, the party came across a peak by the name of Golden Pouch Mountain.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
With their supply of food exhausted, and their master's belly rumbling, Wukong, the fastest of the group, set out on his own to find help.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Unfortunately...the three he left behind ignored Wukong's warning not to leave the protective circle.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Soon after, the trio wandered into a strange tower, and fell right into an enemy's trap.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Yes, there was a Demon King here as well.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
His name: the Single Horned Rhinoceros King, ruler of the Golden Pouch Cave on Golden Pouch Mountain!

My luck ran out the moment I laid eyes on that visual kei-style coat that was perfect for me. I knew it to be a trap, yet I could not help myself.

I suppose this is the punishment we get for not heeding Brother Wukong's warning...

Well, no matter. Your Majesty, at first I thought we had just caught another bunch of fools...

...but it turns out it was none other than Sanzang and her disciples.

Sanzang?

That's right! Remember that woman I told you about? The one headed to Tianzhu who will let you live a much longer life if you eat her up? Well, here she is.

Ooh, this is going to be such a feast. I can't wait for tonight's dinner!

You and your sister both should have been sucked into Brother Wukong's Paopei Gourd, which should also have dissolved both your bodies.
