Placing trust in others. What a foolish, naive thing to do.
[k]

＠Carter (Räum)
Abigail's unshakable faith shrouded Salem in a veil of light.
[k]

＠Carter (Räum)
It was this very thing that completely obviated guilt, and with it, any distinction between good and evil.
[k]

＠Carter (Räum)
Thus were these sinners stuck in purgatory, neither punished nor forgiven for their foul deeds.
[k]

＠Carter (Räum)
Enough to give even the Witchfinder General a chance for salvation. Enough for him to see healing in a place so dripping with evil that even I cannot stand it.

Abigail, you have sinned once again...

Magical energy is being consumed at an absolutely astonishing rate. And not only on the east coast, but across the entire continent.

This consumption is primarily taking place in heavily populated areas. We are receiving more reports with every passing second. This phenomenon seems to have no regard for the old Bounded Fields in place whatsoever.

Only this time, we're going to do so from the outside, by establishing multiple Bounded Fields.

Unfortunately, this means you'll be sealed in there too.

If you're unable to resolve this in the limited time you have, then we're going to have to use every means at our disposal to incinerate EVERYTHING within these Bounded Fields we're about to erect.
