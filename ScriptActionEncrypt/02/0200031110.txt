Now that we have hostages...
[k]

＠
How should we treat them?[sr]Well, that's obvious.
[k]

＠
Killing them is our best option. Not knowing whether they're dead or alive will panic our enemies.
[k]

＠
And once we no longer have to worry about them,[sr]we will be free to act as we see fit.
[k]

＠
Whenever one deals with humans,[sr]that's the best approach.
[k]

＠
But, our opponents aren't people, you say?[sr]Now that you mention it, I suppose they're not.

...To tell the truth, we Heroic Spirit Swordmasters have no real way of telling right from wrong.

I don't think we should think of the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters as their actual Heroic Spirits.

I know we haven't taken the time to make sure we're on the same page about this, so I want to be clear: they're nothing more than walking corpses.

I was convinced of that when we fought Lord Inshun.[sr]I think you should accept that too, if you can.

True... They do look and sound just[sr]like the Heroic Spirits we know...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
But they're still completely different people.[sr]Master, I believe Lady Musashi is right.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Besides, Heroic Spirits are essentially different people every time they are summoned as Servants anyway.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Even if they retain their memories of[sr]the other times they've been summoned.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
There is no Heroic Spirit who is exactly the same person every time they are summoned. Rather, they're the same person, but one who is as different as possible.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Maybe it would be more accurate to say that they are a completely different person who very closely resembles them each time.
[k]

？1：...Yeah. The Heroic Spirits in Singularities...
？2：Chaldea's spirits are nothing like these, yes.

？！

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
The dead don't come back to life.[sr]And they shouldn't.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
But the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters... Well, as Lady Musashi said, they are corpses. In essence, they ARE the dead come back to life.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
They are beings born from dead Servants.[sr]From what I've been told about Lord Houzouin Inshun...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
...it sounds like becoming a Swordmaster changes everything about them, not just their personalities.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
So it is not like the principle that makes every Heroic Spirit essentially a different version of the same person.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
They may be close to the Servants you saw in Shinjuku, at least in the sense that their Spirit Origins differ from their natural state...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
But that was a phenomenon specific to Shinjuku, so...
