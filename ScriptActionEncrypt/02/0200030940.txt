I knew it; I will never be forgiven. It's all my fault for venturing into that mountain.

I wish I'd never gone to Mt. Ibuki. Even if I was in a hurry...even if I had a good reason to be there...

It wasn't me that did this. It was a distant ancestor...[sr]And his sin...

His sin was...engraved...in my blood...[sr]Yes, my blood. It's all my blood's fault!

My ancestor's curse has tainted my blood!

It's consuming me...violating me...melting me into a pile of sludge!

Right. She would never say something like that. Just yesterday, she told me about how well she got along with snakes. How she saved one once.

＠Musashi
I've heard of the curse of Kouga Saburou. He was a man born in Oumi Kouga who went on to become its lord.
[k]

＠Musashi
One day, his wife went hunting on Mt. Ibuki, and she never returned.
[k]

＠Musashi
So Saburou went to the mountain and descended into the depths of the earth to search for her.
[k]

＠Musashi
After a long journey wandering the underworld realms, he finally returned to the surface...

＠Musashi
Yamata-no-Orochi, or Ooe Daimyojin. The most famous serpent god in all of Japan.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Musashi
With Saburou wandering around his territory for days on end, it would have been easy for Orochi to curse him.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Musashi
Of course, the legend also says that Saburou was healed by a wandering monk, and lived happily ever after.
[k]

[charaFace C 12]

＠Musashi
But, you're a woman. And I highly doubt you're Saburou himself.
[k]

＠Musashi
After all, this country isn't yet enlightened enough to have a woman be the founder of one of its prominent clans.
[k]

＠Musashi
But, there's one Kouga ninja clan that's said to still carry Saburou's blood.
[k]

＠Musashi
And as I recall that clan, the Kouga Mochizuki family...produced one famous female ninja.
[k]

？1：Then...that's her identity...
？2：The Heroic Spirit that became Assassin of Paraíso!

？！

[charaFace C 5]

＠Musashi
Mochizuki Chiyome. The woman who served the Tiger of Kai, Takeda Shingen, during the Warring States period as a spy.
[k]

＠Musashi
I had heard you were either a kunoichi or a shrine maiden, but I had no idea you also carried Kouga Saburou's curse!

＠Assassin of Paraíso
What will you do now, Shinmen Musashi!? My cursed blood has manifested Orochi himself! You cannot hope to defeat him!
[k]

＠Assassin of Paraíso
Indeed, there is nothing more you can even say!
[k]

[charaFace D 19]

＠Assassin of Paraíso
You can't do anything about it. I couldn't do anything about it! Not even becoming a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, let alone a Heroic Spirit, was enough...

＠Assassin of Paraíso
I thought I could escape if I devoted myself to the way of the ninja! But I couldn't escape it. I had to live with this curse right up to the day I died!

Then I thought I could escape if I gave myself over to karma! But, I still can't get away...
