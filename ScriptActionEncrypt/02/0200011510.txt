...In short, no matter how you slice it, this is premeditated murder.
[k]

＠
There's no deep motive here. The only forces at work are grudges, money, and jealousy.

There may be a few tricks, but they're trivial.[sr]Still, they're beyond any detective.

＠
But now, they're failing.

I've given up on about half my calculations, leaving only a slapdash bet where the odds are against us.

I swore to myself that this plan I came up with would never let me do that.

I am quite serious. After all, even if they were to be summoned, they wouldn't possess a body.

Exactly. Where such things are concerned, there is little difference between a Phantom Spirit and a Heroic one.

[charaFace E 0]

The reason is simple: Noble Phantasms are based off of stories, legends, and objects that truly existed.
[k]

＠Holmes
When such things become a Noble Phantasm, their power might be reduced, or, in rare cases, even enhanced.

Of course, when a Phantom Spirit is summoned, the power of their Noble Phantasm likely decays considerably. Not that a Phantom could use one anyway.
