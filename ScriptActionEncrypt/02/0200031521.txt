...It was useless. Any attempt in trying to read your next move was completely futile.

＠Musashi
The essence of my Niten Ichiryu lies in adapting to hundreds...thousands of possibilities. But if my opponent stays one step ahead of all of them, there is nothing it can do.
[k]

＠Musashi
To defeat your Suigetsu, I had to enter the realm of the gods myself.
[k]

＠Musashi
I had to find the one right answer[sr]that lay beyond every possibility.
[k]

＠Musashi
...In other words, I had to slash through the unbreakable heavens themselves. I call it Kengou Battou: Ishana-Daitenshou.

Not at all. I couldn't have beaten you alone. Your swordsmanship was divine in the truest sense of the word.

＠Musashi
I doubt you'll end up going to paradise, but just in case you do...give Lord Inshun my regards.

Ahh, I feel much better.[sr]Hehehe...

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
Cursed Mitsuyoshi.[sr]So this is how you felt whenever you swung your sword.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
No wonder you improved at such an incredible rate.[sr]How infuriating...
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
You may not wish to hear this from me,[sr]but I'm afraid I shall say it anyway.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
Shinmen Musashi. Master of Chaldea. This was the most enjoyable duel...I have ever experienced...
