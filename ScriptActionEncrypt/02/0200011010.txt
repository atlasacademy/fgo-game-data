Thanks to the Holy Grail's power, we[line 2]no, I[line 2]managed to tear out all that was good and kind in me.

Such things would only be a hindrance in my battle against my rival.

[charaFace C 1]

However, I did not expect that such detritus would gain a consciousness of its own in the process.

Let alone that it would run off and attempt to impede us.

[charaFace C 1]

Of course, he was little more than a minor pest scurrying around, until you showed up.
[k]


[charaFace C 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Now the Berserker of Shinjuku has been defeated, and the Rider shows no sign of returning.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Nonetheless...we still have two Servants at our disposal. The plan will proceed without issue.
[k]

？1：What plan?

[charaFace C 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Well now, I'm surprised he didn't tell you.[sr]Or perhaps you haven't come in contact yet?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
But you must have heard from Assassin.[sr]Or did you dismiss it as nonsense?
[k]

？2：The plan to destroy the planet...?

[charaFace C 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
So you do know.
[k]

？！

＠Archer of Shinjuku
It is just as you imagine, [%1]. Our goal is nothing less than the complete and total annihilation of this planet.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Do you think it impossible?[sr]I assure you, it is well within my capability.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
I firmly believe that, and so do those who follow me.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
The world will end in the year 1999. What was once fanciful nonsense will become harsh reality.
[k]

？1：Why would you do something like that!?
？！

[charaFace C 3]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Ah yes, my motive.[sr]Hmm...[charaFace C 1]
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
I suppose it's because I'm a mathematician. I have calculated the power needed to destroy the planet.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
So why wouldn't I want to test my equation to see if it was correct?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
I see you're having trouble accepting my reason.[sr]I suppose I can't blame you.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
But, this is simply what it is to be a mathematician.[sr]I am proud to be evil, and despise those who defy me.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
But...I would prefer Chaldea not interfere.[sr]If I killed you, they'd just send another Master.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
So let's make a deal, [%1].[sr]I shall send you back to Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
In return, Chaldea leaves us alone.
[k]

？1：I could never do that!

[charaFace C 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Of course you could. Just ask Leonardo da Vinci to explain the situation to you later.
[k]

？2：I can't do that.

[charaFace C 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Perhaps you're right.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
However...I believe a genius of Leonardo da Vinci's caliber should soon realize just what the destruction of the planet truly signifies.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 0]

At any rate, feel free to take your time and think it over. There's no reason to kill you any time soon.

[charaFace D 4]

It would be foolish to believe he didn't have at least some idea of the Assassin of Shinjuku's ability.

But in that case, why wouldn't he be wary of Hassan, after he appeared out of nowhere?

[charaFace D 3]

Well then, why don't we look at this from a new angle, yes? As a detective might.

If it makes no sense for him to have believed that Hassan was who he claimed, then perhaps he was aware of his true identity all along?

At first glance, this would appear to be a betrayal on his part.
[k]

？1：It's not...I think.

[charaFace D 1]
＠Shakespeare
He must be quite the Servant for you to trust him so implicitly.
[k]

？2：There's no need for that.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Shakespeare
True. Nor has he made a move since your abduction.
[k]

？！

Hmm... I don't suppose he entrusted anything to you?[sr]Say, a letter?
