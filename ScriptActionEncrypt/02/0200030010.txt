In Mt. Kinbou's Reigandou, an old man awaits the final moments of his life.
[k]

＠
His name: Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara-no-Harunobu.
[k]

＠
Which is to say, I am speaking of myself.
[k]

＠
Yes, I am Shinmen Musashi; one whose blade has spilled the blood of countless others.
[k]

＠
Perhaps I was once called “Miyamoto Musashi”[sr]at some point, but that doesn't matter now.

I may well end up dying today or tomorrow,[sr]but it won't be right this instant. Patience.
[k]

＠
After all, my visitor has yet to arrive.
[k]

＠
...Hmm, now where was I?[sr]Oh yes, my blades.
[k]

＠
I killed...quite a few people with them.
[k]

＠
Blades...
[k]

＠
They are tools for killing; for cutting and slashing human bodies. They once referred to tachi and katana; now they refer to katana and wakizashi.
[k]

＠
Blades are carried by soldiers, by warriors, by bushi... They could also be called samurai, a variation of the word “saburau,” meaning to serve, as they serve their masters.
[k]

＠
In any case, those who command these warriors are known as generals.
[k]

＠
A general is like nothing so much as a master carpenter.
[k]

＠
He must know how to make use of every tool at his disposal to carry out his master's wishes.
[k]

＠
...Even now, I can hear a young Iori telling me he doesn't understand what I mean.
[k]

＠
Perhaps Magonojou would have that smug, knowing expression about now? Yes, I imagine he would.
[k]

＠
Me, I'm hopeless. I didn't understand anything back when I was young. I just traveled the world, cutting down any who challenged me.
[k]

＠
I could never have hoped to be a general. At best, I would have ended up some minor commander bound for some tiny domain.
[k]

＠
How foolish.
[k]

＠
Yes, foolish. What point is there in being good with a blade? It is good for nothing but killing and maiming others...
[k]

＠
Perhaps my life might have been more worthwhile had I been a painter.
[k]

＠
No doubt Takada Matabei would laugh if he heard that.[sr]He would say I'm spouting nonsense in my old age.
[k]

＠
Yes, you're right, Matabei. It is far too late for me to allow myself to wallow in regret now.

＠Old Man
...As if I would ever say something like that. Hahaha!
[k]

＠
There is nothing wrong with a bit of foolishness! I lived in a chaotic age, where the screams of agony were common as bird song!
[k]

＠
I have no regrets! I've spent my whole life cutting, slashing, slaughtering!
[k]

＠
Come then, fate![sr]Show me what my final moments hold!
[k]

＠
Spirits in heaven, forgive me for such fruitless dreams. Treat them as no more than the ramblings of an old man on death's door, and pay them no heed.
[k]

＠
Still, I have precious little time left. My eyes may close forever even before the fateful moment arrives.
[k]

＠Old Man
Nnn... (Cough, hack)...!
[k]

＠
...Well, this is troubling...[sr]How truly vexing.
[k]

＠
Gods... Buddha... At this point, I'll even take an oni, or a demon.

Speak of the devil.[sr]I was just heading to your room to look for you.

I finally found something I've been trying to find for some time...
[k]

？1：What's that?

＠Mash
It's something that concerns you, Senpai.
[k]

？2：What were you so keen to find, Mash?

＠Mash
Oh, I wasn't looking for it for my sake.[sr]If anything, it's more to do with you, Senpai.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Let me start at the beginning.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
Let's see... Senpai, you once said that you met Miyamoto Musashi, the famous swordmaster, during a dream-like experience, right?
[k]

？1：Yup, I sure did.

＠Mash
Well, this concerns her too.
[k]

？2：...I'm afraid I don't remember it very clearly.

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mash
You don't?
[k]

＠Mash
Perhaps there's some rule we don't know about that uniquely affects miniature Singularities.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
Very well then, let me tell you what you told me right after you returned.
[k]

？！

＠Mash
Unlike the historical Miyamoto Musashi, this one you encountered was a woman. Perhaps from a world of Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon.
[k]

＠Mash
She may have been one who travels between worlds via some special means, or even a living human rather than a Heroic Spirit...
[k]

＠Mash
Whatever the case, that was the Musashi you met.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
I found this very intriguing.
[k]

＠Mash
I had nothing to go on but what you told me,[sr]and the circumstantial evidence.
[k]

＠Mash
And there was one more thing, something that kept nagging at me personally.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
If Miyamoto Musashi has been split into two different people, one male, one female...
[k]

＠Mash
There may be a reason for that.
[k]

[wt 1.0]
[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
Of course, there are a fair number of Heroic Spirits with numerous “What if?” Spirit Origins registered here at Chaldea alone.
[k]

＠Mash
Maybe that's the case with Musashi as well,[sr]or maybe she's something completely different.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
...Either way, I had to find out.
[k]

？1：So you were looking for data on Musashi, huh.
？2：And did you? Find something, I mean.

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Yes! And I couldn't have done it without the whole staff's help!

＠Chaldea Staff
Aw, it was no big deal. There was all sorts of always-accessible, text-formatted data already saved to the standard library.
[k]

＠Chaldea Staff
Unfortunately, image data of authentic original texts isn't as easy to find.
[k]

＠Chaldea Staff
But luckily, we recently happened across some that was saved to a stand-alone underground library.
[k]

＠Chaldea Staff
I think my heart skipped a beat when it first turned up, though. After all...
[k]

＠Chaldea Staff
...it said not to look at it in the README file.
[k]

＠Chaldea Staff
Still, I scanned it for viruses and it came up clean, so it should be all right. Probably just someone's idea of a practical joke.
[k]

＠Chaldea Staff
Anyway, I hope this image taken of the original manuscript for the Book of Five Rings helps you two out. Later!

The female Musashi that you met had[sr]nothing to do with it.

If the Musashi you met was different from our history's Miyamoto Musashi, but she also had the same name and fought with two swords...
[k]

＠Mash
Then we may be able to find something else they have in common, or maybe even some way in which they're entirely different, in the manuscript.

I know I'm grasping at straws, so I can't offer anything more definitive right now, but...[charaFace A 12]

No, I am merely a stick-waving samurai who stumbled onto this name.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
I have certainly heard the name “Miyamoto Musashi,” but I've never actually met him. Indeed, I have no connection to him whatsoever, for good or ill.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Nonetheless, now that I go by Kojirou, I cannot ignore the mark that Shinmen Musashi has made upon the world.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Knowledge of The Book of Five Rings was bestowed upon me when I was summoned as a Servant, whether I wished it so or not.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
As such, I know it quite well, though I cannot say how comprehensible its contents will be to you, [&Lord:Lady] [%1].
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Everything up to the Book of Earth and the Book of Water can be interpreted easily enough. But beyond that, it is more a book of riddles than a manual.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Its final chapter, the Book of Void, is nothing more than a scrap that lays Musashi's feelings bare.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Nor are they described in a tangible, material manner. Void discusses what lies beyond... The karmic laws one's eye can see.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
And the concept of “zero,” which at the time was at the very bleeding edge of Buddhist studies.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Indeed, it reads more like a philosophical treatise created to help the reader accept this new way of thinking.

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Rather, she is a woman with thin arms who wields two katana, claims to be Musashi, and aspires to perfect her swordsmanship, hmm.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Fascinating. She sounds very much[sr]like me, and yet entirely different.

＠Sasaki Kojirou
I may be Sasaki Kojirou, but inside, I am merely a single manifestation of one of the many legends surrounding him.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
I am but the shadow of the moon[sr]as reflected in a pool of water.

＠Sasaki Kojirou
But you say this mysterious Musashi you met is apparently THE Musashi, rather than one of his manifestations.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

In which case, did this female Musashi ever tell you this?
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
“Kojirou, you have lost.”
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
According to other swordmasters, that is what Musashi said to Kojirou after the latter had cast aside his scabbard of his own accord while awaiting Musashi on Ganryu Island.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
There are numerous interpretations of their duel,[sr]but there are no lines more famous than this.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
As such, those words would prove that this Musashi was indeed who she claims.
[k]

＠Sasaki Kojirou
Perhaps you even came to believe she was Musashi because you had heard her speak that line,[sr][&Lord:Lady] [%1]?
[k]

？1：No, she never said anything like that.
？2：She's still Musashi whether she said that or not.

Oho. Oh, ho ho. That complicates matters. Then I believe this female Musashi has yet to reach the void.

Musashi was my most ephemeral rival. A wielder of two katana for whom Sasaki Kojirou had waited since time immemorial.

However, as this matter concerns Chaldea's sole Master, it is of utmost importance. As such, I shall be continuing my investigation.

It's a shame that things have come to this, but now that they have, everything depends upon all of us doing our best.

Okay then, to make up for that,[sr]let me tell you what's going on!

Seeing as it's such a nice day, I decided this was a good time and place to eat. I unwrapped my meal and was just getting ready to eat when you suddenly fell from the sky.

I caught you, purely on instinct, but in the process,[sr]my rice ball fell into the dirt! ...But aaanyway...

＠Musashi
I tried calling to you and slapping you awake, but you were out like a lantern, so I figured I was in for a day of waiting around here to keep an eye on you.
[k]

＠Musashi
But then you just went and woke up on your own, like Yajirobe.

＠Musashi
I see your luck is still as strong as ever. Or maybe Lady Kannon has taken you under her protection.
