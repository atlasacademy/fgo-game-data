Master, please stand back![sr]We've mortally wounded it...

You see...for most Servants summoned at Chaldea,[sr]the closer we can be to Master, the better.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Essentially, staying close by significantly enhances our power. That's why Master always stays by our side.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
But in this case, it's just too[sr]dangerous for you to be here, Master!
[k]

？1：Which is exactly why I have to stay nearby!
？2：Don't worry! This is how I always fight!
