...I'm so glad you're safe and sound.[sr]You must be exhausted.

It's good to have you back too, Senpai.

Kotarou got here ahead of you, and he filled us in on all the details we couldn't discuss during our transmission.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
Now we know that, even though you've been asleep this whole time...you were still fighting to help others.
[k]

＠Mash
And...to help us.

Thank you, Senpai.[sr]I can't wait to hear all about your adventures.

We still don't know the real identity of this “Satan” the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters mentioned, whether it was actually Satan or something else entirely...

＠Da Vinci
...and above all, the things you experienced in your dreamland adventure are very valuable.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Da Vinci
Even a normal Rayshift is a great feat in and of itself, but projecting your consciousness into a pseudo-body through a dream...?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And then encountering a world-crosser on top of that?[sr]It was one mindblower after another.

Your body may have technically been asleep,[sr]but your mind was fully active the entire time.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
So please, take your time and rest up.[sr]There's no rush...
[k]

？1：I think I'll do that.
？2：I AM kind of tired.

It's...

I wonder if someone forgot it.[sr]Or maybe Monte Cristo put it here on purpose.

My head is so foggy I can't think of who it could be.[sr]I'm not sleepy at all, but my head still feels sluggish.

How exactly am I supposed to rest up, anyway? It feels like it would be weird to go back to sleep...

Lemme see...I think he called this a “video recording?” Remember that missionary we met in Toke castle town?

I, uh...[sr]Well, to put it bluntly, I died.

At least, I thought I did. But the next time I woke up, there was this blue sky...

[charaFace H 0]
＠Musashi
And from there, I crossed over to some new worlds and kept going on my journey.

[charaFace H 1]
＠Musashi
After several crossings, I arrived at Chaldea. Well, actually, just outside Chaldea. It was frrreeeeeezing!

[charaFace H 0]

Anyway, I ran into the missionary look-alike after that, and...here we are.

Okay, remember that guy we talked to on your comms device thingy a while back? Holmes, the detective?
[k]

＠Musashi
He said I'm a Heroic Spirit who materialized here thanks to a Chaldea summoning spell.
[k]

＠Musashi
Basically, now that we've made a connection, my[sr]Spirit Origin got added as a Heroic Spirit after I died...
[k]

＠Musashi
So he said it's no surprise I can be summoned at Chaldea now.
[k]

[charaFace H 8]
＠Musashi
Um... I think he also said that now that I'm a Servant, I've automatically forged a contract with you as my Master?
[k]

[charaFace H 1]
＠Musashi
Oh, and he also said he found it strange...
[k]

＠Musashi
...that a “what-if” Heroic Spirit who ordinarily shouldn't exist could be summoned with a Chaldea summoning spell.
