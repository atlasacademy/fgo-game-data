＠
To tell the truth...
[k]

＠
I don't remember how I came to be.
[k]

[effect bit_sepia01]
[scene 10001]
[fadein black 1.0]
[wait fade]

＠
There is nothing in my records detailing exactly when that happened. All I know is that I was left lying around, broken, after the end of the age of war.
[k]

＠
Kashin Koji, a peerless sorcerer, essentially gave birth to me by creating my body.
[k]

＠
My second father figure, the first Fuuma Kotarou, installed all manner of ninjutsu he created into my memory banks.
[k]

＠
Precious few people know how valuable this body of mine truly is. As far as most people are concerned, I am just another ninja.
[k]

＠
If my body were to break, I would essentially be dead.[sr]I suppose it is my fate to be abandoned.
[k]

＠
In the end, I am just a machine made of flesh, iron, and wood. A monster not unlike the homunculi produced by Western alchemy.
[k]

＠
How long did I spend as an unmoving, human-shaped machine?
[k]

＠
...Perhaps it was even longer than the time I have spent operating as a ninja.
[k]

＠
Despite operating for many, many years...
[k]

＠
...once I was broken, most of my records were damaged,[sr]and I could no longer play them back properly.
[k]

＠
I was simply left to decay...
[k]

＠
...as my records...my thoughts, slipped away...
[k]

＠
In time, my mind was emptied out completely,[sr]and my body would no longer move at all.
[k]

＠
It simply groaned, and creaked, and cracked...
[k]

＠
Then one day, a man found me.[sr]He repaired me, and gave me purpose as my new master.
[k]

＠
That man was summoned to the province of Shimousa as a Caster-class Servant. His name is Caster of Limbo.
[k]

[messageOff]
[scene 47900 2.0]
[wt 3.5]

＠
From the moment he repaired me, I regained my consciousness. Or at the very least, I was conscious from that point onwards.
[k]

＠
Whether this consciousness was newly formed, or the one I had lost during the years I was shut down, I can't say.
[k]

＠
But either way, I didn't care. Why?
[k]

＠
Because I was created to be a ninja. That was my purpose then, and it is my purpose now. As such, all I need do is carry out my master's orders.
[k]

＠
As long as I have my master, there is nothing to doubt. As long as I have my master, all I need to do is carry out my mission.
[k]

＠
Whoever the Caster of Limbo turns out to be.
[k]

＠
Indeed, I don't know who he really is.[sr]He may be a Heroic Spirit, or a hero, or a human...
[k]

＠
Perhaps he is even an oni.[sr]Or something else altogether...?
[k]

＠
At any rate, it doesn't matter. It didn't matter.[sr]All I had to do was obey my new parental figure.
[k]

＠
...I must not doubt him, no matter what.[sr]And yet...
[k]

＠
...Lord Kotarou.[sr]You have been checking in with me so often.
[k]

＠
For some reason,[sr]I feel as though I already know you.
[k]

＠
Even though my records[line 2]my equivalent of a normal human's memories[line 2]have nearly all been lost.
[k]

＠
I should have no records remaining, save the ones containing the ninjutsu I require for my missions.
[k]

＠
Lord Kotarou.[sr]Lord Kotarou.
[k]

＠
Did I ever meet you...
[k]

＠
...before I was broken...?
