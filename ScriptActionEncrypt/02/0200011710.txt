There isn't. Good, bad, it's all equally transient.

[charaFace F 5]

To be honest, I was surprised to find I even had a good side. Even more so when he openly opposed me.

It seems I've made a very good friend indeed.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠F：Moriarty
But I've no interest in my good side. So far as I am concerned, it is merely detritus to be cast aside.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：Moriarty
The only person I'm interested in analyzing is you, Master of Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠F：Moriarty
You were once trapped here, only for Holmes to rescue you, and yet you reappear here of your own volition.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：Moriarty
None of this is preordained.[sr]All of this is the result of innumerable calculations.
[k]

？1：...What do you mean?

[charaFace F 5]
＠F：Moriarty
There is no need to answer that. The only part I haven't been able to calculate is what happens next.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：Moriarty
Whether I lose, or you lose, the outcome of this exchange is immaterial.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠F：Moriarty
Either way, my role will be over.
[k]

？2：Do we have to do this?

[charaFace F 5]
＠F：Moriarty
Yes, we do.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠F：Moriarty
Nothing has changed.[sr]My calculations are correct.
[k]

？！

[charaFace F 5]
＠F：Moriarty
For 3,000 years, I have awaited this moment.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]
＠F：Moriarty
...Hm? What am I saying?
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠F：Moriarty
No, that's not right.[sr]I haven't been waiting for this at all.

I'm just imagining things.

Thanks to Der Freischütz's power, the asteroid is already here.

＠F：Moriarty
Once I have made it into a bullet, it will be loaded perfectly into this tower.

[charaFace F 2]
＠F：Moriarty
I don't wish to die. I don't wish to die, but...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

...in this single instance, I value the murder of this planet more than my own life.
