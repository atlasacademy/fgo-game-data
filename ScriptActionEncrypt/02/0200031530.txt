I have indeed crossed between many worlds seeking my revenge, and lost my humanity even as I remained human.

But the same is true of you. I do not know why you began traveling across worlds, nor do I care.

The fact remains that you have lost your humanity as well. You are nothing more than a monster who no longer has the right to call herself human.
