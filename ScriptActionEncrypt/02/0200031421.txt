We defeated the Orochi![sr]Nicely done, Master.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
Those Orochi were exceptionally strong, weren't they?[sr]I wonder if it has anything to do with us getting closer to the castle?
[k]

？1：Don't worry, I've still got plenty of fight left in me.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
I'm relieved to hear that. I may not be able to help as much as I would like, but I'll still do everything I can!
[k]

？2：I guess I haven't got the hang of this after all...

＠Fuuma Kotarou
If we are to take Paraíso and Saṃghāta Hell at their word, these serpents are kin to Yamata-no-Orochi, who is said to be a Divine Spirit.

So it's not surprising that they would be such a challenge. I'll have to redouble my efforts as well.

Surely there is no need for introductions now.[sr]I am just a passing missionary.

That's right. I see you remembered me, [%1]. I'm also surprised to see you heading straight for the heart of this disturbance.

Now, it looks to me like you're headed for Toke Castle.[sr]Is that right?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Missionary
That ominous aura surrounding it is a curse designed expressly to keep people away. The fact that you are advancing toward it despite that tells me that you are all either hopelessly dim-witted...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Missionary
...or that there is something giving you the strength to endure its fury and malice. Either way, you made the right choice, [%1].
[k]

＠Missionary
There is no need for you to cease your advance.[sr]Continue on your way.
[k]

＠Missionary
A sorcerer is using the keep at Toke Castle...
[k]

＠Missionary
...or rather, Onriedo Castle, as it ought to be known now, to perform a ritual.
[k]

？1：Onriedo Castle!

Onriedo... Paraíso mentioned that.[sr]So, that's what this castle is called...

[charaFadeout E 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 4]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]

Onriedo... Paraíso mentioned that. I suppose the last part DOES rhyme with “Edo Castle”... I wonder if that was intentional?

If that name doesn't betray his true intentions, I can't imagine what would! Indeed, that name is undoubtedly meant to be a play on words.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Missionary
It is not merely the embodiment of rage, regret, and agony. It is a curse. Or, perhaps, anger towards a god who has yet to provide salvation.

The deeper the depths of one's love,[sr]the easier it is for them to fall prey to hate.

Though he is certainly not the only one to blame for this, he has also grown well past the bounds of any one person.

Although, how do you know so much?[sr]Are you in league with this sorcerer person?

But no matter. Hehe, hahahahaha! Let me just say that as a fellow Christian, I can understand how he feels!
[k]

？1：What's THAT supposed to mean!?
？2：That doesn't answer anything!

？！

[charaFace E 5]
＠Missionary
At any rate, you must hurry, [%1].[sr]The sorcerer is not the only one in Onriedo's keep.
[k]

＠Missionary
Matsudaira's daughter is sure to be held captive there[sr]as well. What was her name again? If your memory serves[line 2]
[k]

？1：Kiyohime!
？2：She's being held in the castle!?

？！

＠Missionary
Driven by revenge, the sorcerer means to cast a far-ranging, multilayered curse on the entire Tokugawa regime! His curse is so powerful that it will threaten the stability of many parallel worlds!
[k]

＠Missionary
And since his aim is to curse every possibility of a Tokugawa regime, Matsudaira's daughter would make for the perfect catalyst, given her Tokugawa heritage!
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Missionary
Her blood may be a bit lacking compared to someone from the immediate Tokugawa family, but it should still serve for his plans.
[k]

＠Missionary
I mean, given that Iemitsu is only the third shogun, her[sr]blood is still more than strong enough. ...[charaFace E 0]Aha, I see.
[k]

Perhaps he had been looking for a parallel world where Matsudaira's daughter was living near Edo soon after the Shimabara Rebellion.

Well, once Kiyohime's soul is sacrificed, Onriedo Castle will be complete, and this world, along with many others, will be destroyed. Now hurry!

Well? What are you waiting for? Go on, go!

？1：Thank you! I promise we'll save Kiyohime...
