Is it so strange? I'm far from the first Demon God Pillar to raise a human.

And my own special trait comes from towns, after all.

[charaFace B 5]

That's why it doesn't bother me to present myself as human, or to wear clothes, or to live in a house. In fact, I find it rather comforting.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Carter
I suppose it would be fair to say that such things are precisely what led me to split from Goetia's consensus.

They feared death too much, to the point that they became fixated on it.

＠Carter
I'm not like Forneus or Häagenti.

Our[line 2]Goetia's objective was to save mankind.[sr]That has been true ever since we were born.
[k]

＠Carter
That is precisely why Salem, and Abigail Williams, were chosen.
[k]

＠Carter
Salem is positioned on the border of sanity and madness. The wisdom of the modern age and the darkness of the Middle Ages are so closely entwined here as to be almost completely indistinguishable.
[k]

＠Carter
There is no other place where the two extremes of humanity's nature are so clearly laid bare.

＠Carter
She was everything I could have hoped for and more.[sr]Thanks to her, I am certain to succeed.
[k]

？1：What are you planning on making her do...!?
？！

[charaFace B 3]

＠Carter
Don't get me wrong. I am not making her do anything.[sr]She will do this because SHE chooses to.
[k]

＠Carter
She will complete the great work that we could not:[sr]the salvation of mankind.
[k]

＠Carter
...And she will do so through great pain.
[k]

＠Carter
It is pain that is the basis of human happiness.[sr]Nothing in the world could be more valuable.
[k]

＠Carter
Everyone feels pain in equal measure.[sr]Without it, well, you would all cease to be human.
[k]

＠Carter
It is worth far more than love or death could ever hope to be. Abigail will be its harbinger.
[k]

＠Carter
Tomorrow, when the courthouse opens at dawn, she will be tried as a witch...
[k]

＠Carter
And all is going well...
[k]

＠Carter
Many have tried to save Abigail before.[sr]But none have ever succeeded.
[k]

＠Carter
Even I was not up to that task.[sr]That is why I invited Chaldea here again...

It's possible to do that within the bounds of a town. Especially after I secured a source of magical energy.
