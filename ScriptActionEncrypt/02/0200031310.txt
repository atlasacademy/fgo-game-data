＠Musashi
I saw something that really surprised me recently. Remember those oni from the other day?
[k]

＠Musashi
One of them outright said she was broken... I couldn't believe it. I'm glad she said it after our duel was over.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Musashi
She wasn't the first cool and collected oni I've met, but...she was definitely the first to own up to her own failings like that.
[k]

＠Musashi
I wonder how she must have felt...what made her[sr]feel the way she did to call herself “broken.”
[k]

＠Musashi
...[sr]...
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Musashi
If by “broken” she meant “incomplete,”[sr]then I'm in the same boat as her.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
Even though I was born a woman, I never planned to get married, or even carry on my own family's legacy.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Musashi
That sort of thing might fly in [%1]'s time, but not in the age of war.
[k]

＠Musashi
If someone were to point out to me that I'm fundamentally flawed, all I'd really be able to do is agree with them.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
As far as I can tell,[sr]I'm the only one living her life like this.
[k]

＠Musashi
Even the other swordsmen I've met have all been able to settle down to some degree.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Musashi
But not me.[sr]I just can't seem to stay put.
[k]

＠Musashi
I'm always traveling, and I never really look back.[sr]That must be why I keep wandering into other worlds.
[k]

＠Musashi
No matter where I go, no matter what I do, I never leave any lasting impression on that world.
[k]

＠Musashi
That's why I keep popping up in all sorts of different[sr]places. It's like every world is telling me, [charaFace A 0]“Oh, sure, you can come in, since you don't matter.”
[k]

＠Musashi
And then, “All done? Right, out then.[sr]I couldn't care less about you.”
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Musashi
Truth be told, I'm more of a ghost than a person.
[k]

＠Musashi
I know all sorts of things most people don't, and I'm constantly meeting new people and leaving them behind when I get kicked out to the next world.
[k]

＠Musashi
But if you were to ask me why I'm doing all this, all I could say is that I'm trying to surpass my dad.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Musashi
(Sigh) When you get right down to it,[sr]I'm really just petty.
[k]

＠Musashi
I love money and honor and all that stuff, but the one thing I can't budge on is my silly childish pride.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Musashi
Oh well, nothing I can do about that! When you get right down to it, I'm a fool who only knows how to live for the moment!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
As long as I'm striving to reach the void,[sr]I'll be a wandering warrior. As for my future...
[k]

＠Musashi
When the god Tenjin comes to reside within my blade... When it reaches the pinnacle of Tenman Daijizai Tenjin, or even just Ishana-Ten...
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Musashi
...that's when I'll accept my fate.
[k]

＠Musashi
In the void lies virtue, and no evil. Wisdom exists, principle exists, the Way exists, spirit does not.
[k]

＠Musashi
A state of being second to none.[sr]The domain of mastery beyond mastery.
[k]

＠Musashi
As much as I talked about that sort of thing, I never thought I would ever actually go down that path...
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Musashi
Haha, I guess it was worth spending so[sr]much time learning about martial arts!
[k]

＠Musashi
It's hard to believe, but I really got the[sr]hang of it during my duel with Lady Raikou!
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Musashi
...Which means the big problem still lies ahead.[sr]Pretty soon, my Niten Ichiryu will be complete.
[k]

＠Musashi
Once it is, I will have lost the only purpose I had in life. I don't know how to get home, and I have no one to settle down with.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Musashi
Once my sword is truly invincible,[sr]I don't know what I'm going to do with myself.

It was then that the abnormality in Shimousa revealed its true nature. A gross abomination stood in place of the second Edo itself, Toke Castle.
[k]

＠
This demonic castle appeared in the blink of an eye, as though the warring age's legend of the One-Night Castle had come to life.
[k]

＠
Not one person witnessed the castle's transformation. Before anyone knew what has happening, Toke Castle was gone, replaced by this new monstrosity.
[k]

＠
According to Heian military journals, the leader of the rebels made his base in Shimousa. Does this then mean this castle is born of a grudge against all of Japan...?
[k]

＠
No. No, for this was not truly Shimousa,[sr]but the land of Kazusa given the name “Shimousa.”
[k]

＠
This castle is a bastion of demons,[sr]one that threatens to desecrate the entire world!
[k]

＠
Its name: Onriedo Castle!
[k]

＠
In a flash, the true sun vanished,[sr]and the world was thrown into darkness.
[k]

＠
In its place hung a crimson moon, glistening the color of freshly spilled blood. As of now, all of Shimousa is shrouded in its angry red glow.

Hell erupted all around. Strange sounds reverberated around Toke Castle town as it was a powerful magical energy seeped into its very fabric.
[k]

＠
Under the black sky lit only by the[sr]bloody moon, people were transformed.
[k]

＠
Resistance was futile.[sr]Screams fell on deaf ears.
[k]

＠
No one knew what was happening, no one could fight back. This is one of Caster of Limbo's most evil of arts!
[k]

＠
The ultimate wickedness, it twists and[sr]distorts living things beyond recognition!
[k]

＠
It crushes the will of its victims. Once cast,[sr]it twists humans in its range into monsters!
[k]

＠
However, it does not transform every human it finds.[sr]There is a chance for some to remain unaffected.
[k]

＠
It transforms at random. In an instant, one person can find herself beset by monstrous neighbors. A man could find that his wife had become an oni. A mother, that her children had become beasts.
[k]

＠
Those unfortunates with no magical resistance are simply altered, human norms switched with beastly urges, and they begin devouring humans around them.

The grotesque moon cast its bloodred light upon the Sorcerer. His form proved to be identical to a certain Spirit Origin registered within Chaldea...
[k]

＠
...the Heroic Spirit Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.
[k]

＠
Indeed, his name was Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, and he did greatly resemble the historical figure connected to the tragedy of Shimabara.
[k]

＠
But he was not the Heroic Spirit who made his mark on humanity. This man was from a history quite different from the one we know.
[k]

＠
He was a human without a Spirit Origin; the sole survivor of the hellscape that was Shimabara...
[k]

＠
...and a man gone mad with rage and fury.
[k]

＠
With his name never going down in history, this separate version of Amakusa Shirou from a Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon traveled across many worlds unbeknownst to us.
[k]

＠
As he traveled across these many mysterious worlds...
[k]

＠
...his grudge grew and evolved until he had become the living embodiment of hate. He accumulated power, and before he knew it, he had moved beyond mankind.

Then, following the call of something that had reached out to him, he passed through the final door and arrived in this world.
