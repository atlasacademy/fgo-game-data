...There is an unwritten rule here in Shinjuku about what to do when that terrible howl rings out.
[k]

＠
If the howl is far away, you're safe.[sr]If it's close, you run away.
[k]

＠
It doesn't matter if you are fighting for your life, mugging an innocent, or are being mugged yourself.
[k]

＠
When you hear its howl nearby, you drop whatever you are doing and flee as fast as you can.
[k]

＠
As far as unwritten rules go, this one is absolute.

Wolf!? You mean this thing coming towards you at...two hundred kilometers per hour!?

Well, that is if you can still call a monster capable of tracking its prey at while running at two hundred kilometers per hour an animal!

You can feel your soul shudder every time you hear it, right? That's fear at work.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
It's an extremely unusual kind of Servant, you see.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Most Servants cannot exist if they are purely fiction. Their origins are rooted in myths and legends that have some kernel of true existence to them.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
There must be a powerful reason to exist on fiction alone.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
For example...the embodiment of a wish to keep one's children safe. Like a picture book.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Do you have any Servants like that on hand?
[k]

？1：There's one who likes to go for a spin.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
I see. Fascinating. I would love to meet them for myself at some point.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

？2：I'm afraid not.

＠Archer of Shinjuku
I see. Well, if you ever summon one, I hope you'll let me meet them.
[k]

？！

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Master, the wolf we're about to come in contact with is entirely fiction; it has no reason to exist.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
In other words, it is not a Heroic Spirit, which in turn means that it cannot be a Servant.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
At least, under normal circumstances.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Fictions whose Spirit Origin values fail to suffice. Concepts that never go beyond mere urban legend. Beings who simply wither and disappear, failing to become either Heroes or Anti-Heroes.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
We call them Phantom Spirits.

What's more, these Phantom Spirits are extraordinarily peculiar!

They're able to be summoned as a set, you see[line 2]a mythical pair of twins, for instance, or a hero accompanied by their partner!
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
However! As remarkable as such a summoning may be, surely it is still unthinkable that two beings who had absolutely no connection in life could be summoned together, right!?

And yet, that's exactly what happened!

It is rather like something out of a fairy tale, no? But, well, it is every bit as cruel as the stories, and the wolf is no better.
