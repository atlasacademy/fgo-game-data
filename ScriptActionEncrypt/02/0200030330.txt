Oh, but should we tell them scary things have showed up? [charaFace A 2]Or maybe we shouldn't wake them up right now?

Hopefully, whatever it is that keeps the evil spirits away from villages will work on Lord Inshun too.
[k]

＠Musashi
But it might not. In which case, we should[sr]probably have everyone evacuate in a hurry.

[charaFace B 4]

＠Musashi
The way Lord Inshun is now,[sr]I'm sure he won't hesitate to[line 2]

？1：Come on, let's hurry!

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
They must have hidden themselves in that hay, where they tremble with fright even now! Haha, hahahahaha! So you've turned coward, have you, Shinmen Musashi!?
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
No matter!
[k]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
Even though I have only just been reborn as a swordmaster, I cannot abide the stench of life! This place positively reeks of it!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
...[sr]...A village, huh?
[k]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
I see it will be a trifle difficult to pass through the entrance, but that's hardly cause for concern.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
It may stop the dark weaklings, but for us Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, it may as well not exist at all. Now then... Musashi! Are you listening!?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
If you won't come out, then I'm afraid I have no choice...

It was then that the sounds began.

At first, there was only Inshun's howls of rage,[sr]as though he were cursing life itself.

Soon after came the sounds of something being demolished.

Musashi covered Onui's ears, unsure whether she would understand what was happening.

＠Village Man
W-what's going on!? Who are you!?[sr]Wh-wh-why would a monk attack us?

Honey! Honey!!![sr]Aieee! N-no, please! Please!!!

H-his head![sr]Oh god, what happened to his head!?
[k]

[se ade71]

＠Village Woman
Ah...
[k]

＠
...There were no survivors.
[k]

＠
The voices of men. Women. All sorts and all kinds.[sr]Every one of them, screaming.
[k]

＠
One. Two. Three. Four. Five... I knew I would never[sr]forget the number of people I heard screaming.
[k]

＠
After the fifty-fourth scream...
[k]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
Oh well, nothing to be done now. If Musashi and the other humans refuse to serve as my quarry, these villagers will just have to serve in their place!
[k]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
Hahaha![sr]What a grand, lovely feeling!
[k]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
If you and [%1] are hearing this,[sr]Musashi, then remember it well!
[k]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
Thanks to your decision to hide, my spear has grown so delightfully drenched! I never knew that blood was such an effective lubricant!
[k]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
Now my spear has become sharper than ever![sr]Hehe, heh haha, hahahahahaha!
[k]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
You have my thanks! Not only do I already possess an invincible body, but now an invincible spear as well!

...I'm so sorry.[sr]That must have been so hard for you.
[k]

＠Musashi
I know you wish you could have gone out there and helped. It must have been excruciating, not being able to do anything for them.
[k]

＠Musashi
But, there really was nothing we could do.[sr]Please understand.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Musashi
I can't stop Lord Inshun. There's no way to defeat a demon who doesn't blink at getting his head cut off.
[k]

＠Musashi
Even if I were to try and fight him, I have no weapons[line 2]no blade capable of killing him.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Musashi
So once he caught up...this was inevitable.
[k]

＠Musashi
...Not that that makes any of this easier to swallow.
[k]

？1：I AM sad and angry I couldn't help them.
？2：But above all, I don't want anyone else to die.

I'm with you there.[sr]So we'll just have to do whatever we can.
