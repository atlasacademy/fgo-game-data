Even the calves that survived suffered terrible wounds. They'll never grow into viable cattle now.

These ghouls have a keen aversion to all living things.

To sate their appetites, they slaughter[sr]their prey and feed off the corpses.

I'm a Servant without a Master.
[k]

＠Circe
I probably manifested as part of[sr]Da Vinci's summoning experiments.
[k]

＠Circe
I was so confused when I initially manifested, and my magical energy was running really low to boot.
[k]

＠Circe
Looking back on it, the summoning system probably didn't give me sufficient knowledge for the times.
[k]

＠Circe
Even with Medea there, I couldn't trust Chaldea as an institution, so I decided to flee.
[k]

＠Circe
I snuck around looking for different ways to escape, and thought I might ask an outside Master for help.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Circe
But when I learned there was nothing around Chaldea but ice and snow, my hope turned to desperation.
[k]

＠Circe
I'm not really gifted with a ton of[sr]staying power or endurance, you know.
[k]

＠Circe
That was about when this Salem stuff started[sr]happening, so I figured this was my chance.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

It didn't seem like coincidence.[sr]Actually, it felt like someone was guiding me.

You really need to ask?[sr]Because Tituba's dead!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Circe
You must have all figured this out by now, right?
[k]

＠Circe
She's a Servant. Well, was, I guess.[sr]And “Tituba” wasn't her True Name.
[k]

＠Circe
I don't know who she was, but somebody summoned[sr]her, and was providing her with magical energy.

[charaFace B 0]

＠Circe
I admit, I was only pretending to help establish contact with Chaldea. I've actually been jamming it this whole time.

My name is Mash, and I'll be your narrator this evening. Later I will also appear as an actress in the play.

Today, The [%1] Company will be performing a thrilling fantasy...
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
A beloved tale from the Eastern kingdom of Qing...
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
We will be performing a chapter of a grand epic called “Journey to the West.”
[k]

[charaFace C 7]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Our tale begins over a thousand years ago...
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
...when a famed Buddhist named Xuanzang Sanzang sets off westward in search of inspirational sutras.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Sutras, in case you didn't know, are like the Bible for those of the Buddhist faith.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
And while “Journey to the West” may be fictional,[sr]Xuanzang Sanzang was a real person.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
A person who crossed a distance equivalent to three round trips between Salem and London.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Mash (Narrator)
And with nothing more than the unshakable faith she held in her heart!
