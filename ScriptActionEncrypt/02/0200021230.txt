＠Scheherazade
Well, I have read many books... While I am unsure of the details, I believe I have an idea of what this place is.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
I believe you know it as well, [%1]. Urashima Tarou. The Dragon Palace. Otohime. And...the Tamatebako.
[k]

？1：Of course! I read about it in a picture book!
？！

＠Scheherazade
Otohime, the princess of the undersea Dragon Palace, invited Urashima Tarou to her palace, and gave him the Tamatebako when he returned to land.
[k]

？1：But she also told him not to open it.
？！

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 7]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Scheherazade
Indeed. That would make no sense whatsoever. Therefore, I believe the correct interpretation is that it was not meant to be opened lightly.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
In other words, the Tamatebako is most likely something that can only be used once.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
And so, when Urashima Tarou returned to land, and learned that far more time had passed than what he had experienced in the Dragon Palace...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
...he opened the Tamatebako in desperation, and transformed into an old man... Or so the story goes.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Scheherazade
However... I think that his sadness over how much older others had grown may have been the reason why he opened the box.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Scheherazade
That is to say, his transformation occurred because he wanted to reconcile the difference in the time that passed for himself and the outside world.
[k]

？1：So, basically...he wished to become old?
？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Scheherazade
Exactly. He WISHED for it. If you might permit me to make a bit of an intuitive leap...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
The Tamatebako grant wishes.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
I believe they contain a mass of highly concentrated magical energy... Energy that can be used in any way the wish-maker desires.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
The Tamatebako senses the wish of the one who opens it, then uses its vast magical energy as fuel to create the desired phenomena.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
In essence...I believe you can think of them as single-use wish granters.

Okay, so...basically, they're not actually physical items, but super-duper magical energy doodads that can be used for anything?

Essentially, yes. Though I imagine there are still some limits on what they can do.

Of course, if a mage or Servant who could make full use of its magical energy were to open one...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
...it would probably serve a function closer to [%1]'s Command Spells than a wish granter.
[k]

？1：Single-use Command Spells, huh... Sounds great!
？2：Be nice if we found a Holy Grail like that too.

Now I see. So Dahut must have been using one simply to enhance her strength.

In her case, that was likely the only option she had available. But I imagine we could find any number of alternative uses for it.

[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠d'Eon
We won't know unless we try, but I believe it would be worth the attempt.
[k]

＠d'Eon
If it works, we may be able to safely employ techniques that we normally avoid using so as not to drain Master's magical energy.

Given what Dahut was saying, maybe there are more Tamatebako to be found in that palace place.

＠Columbus
Even if they are single-use, if we can get several of them, they should still be pretty useful, right?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

Hahaha... Looks like our luck is finally changing!

I'm not talking about anything complicated. Just something like a simple contract. As long as he'd start obeying a few basic commands, that'd do.

“Attack,” “Stop attacking,” “Go forward,” “Stay”...[sr]That sort of thing.
