Abigail! Abigail, where are you!?
[k]

？1：Mr. Carter!
？2：Abigail's staying with us now.
？！

＠Carter
Then, she's all right...? My blood froze when I saw what had happened to our house...
[k]

＠Carter
I see... So you took care of my niece while I was away, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].

[charaFace A 2]

＠Carter
I can't thank you enough.[sr]That's twice you've saved the life of my only family.

＠Carter
Still... It's not safe to camp out in the woods. Fortunately, I know of a suitable vacant house we can use. It belongs to some acquaintances of mine.
[k]

＠Carter
I wish I could ask them for permission, but given the circumstances, I think they'll understand.
[k]

＠Carter
...Is something wrong?[sr]You seem puzzled.
[k]

＠Carter
...Mash?
[k]

＠Carter
I agreed to take her with me as far as the village's exit. I thought she had headed back on her own.
