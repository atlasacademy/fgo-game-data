If the Resistance had been ready to attack from the outside when it started to sink...

That way, we can come in and take control of the city after you've taken down the Assassin.

Alternatively, we can storm the place on your signal if something unexpected happens, like in Ys.

Either way, I'm afraid the Resistance needs me to lead them, so I have to stay behind. I'm sorry to make you face all the danger yourself.

The Nightless City... A legendary place from Chinese myth, much like Ys was a legend from French myth.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The original name in Chinese can also be translated as “Nightless Castle”. However, the word for “Castle” actually means the outer walls of a city in Chinese.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's described in the Book of Han, but there aren't a lot of details about it. All we know is that the city was known for being very bright, even at nighttime.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But given the image its name invokes, that expression came to be used for other cities that never sleep, like Shinjuku and Shanghai.

I too believe we should learn from our mistakes at Ys. This time, we should take great pains to ensure this covert operation remains covert.
[k]

＠d'Eon
As such, we should start by gathering information with as small a group as possible.
[k]

Once we know more about the city itself, the threats we face, and where to find the Assassin, then and only then do we all move in.

[charaFace C 5]

As we suspected, this city is primarily inhabited by women...
[k]

＠d'Eon
...but unlike the pirates of Ys and the Amazons, these women are quite diverse in dress and race.
[k]

＠d'Eon
The only thing they have in common is that they are all women.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠d'Eon
Therefore, as long as we keep our wits about us, the two of us should also be able to pass as citizens.

＠d'Eon
Of course, if you insist, I am willing to go alone.
[k]

？1：That's too dangerous. You should go together.

[charaFace C 0]

True. Working as a team would let us deal with a much wider variety of challenges.

＠d'Eon
Much as I am used to working solo, this would undoubtedly be safer in case something goes wrong.

If anything, he'd hate the idea of waiting around doing nothing in a back alley when there's a whole city full of women right in front of him.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Da Vinci
Either that, or he'd be on the edge of his seat waiting for something exciting to happen.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And I don't mean an enemy attack. Although now that I think about it, I suppose a Celtic warrior would find that exciting too, for very different reasons.

I see... So, what sort of exciting things would the Fergus you know be waiting for, if not an enemy attack?
[k]

？1：A half-naked woman running away from a bad guy?
？2：A half-naked woman falling from the sky for reasons?

No, that can't be right. I'm sure I turn out to be a proper warrior. She mentioned I would enjoy an enemy attack as well as...that other thing.

[charaFace D 4]

Still, I can't help but worry... I'd better get back to training. That'll get my mind off this stuff.

I think I'll start with some Celtic squats while keeping an eye on our perimeter. Pardon me.

For me, training is something I do because I have to.[sr]I don't know if there's anything more to it than that.

That said, I don't do nearly enough, which is why I'm still just a fledgling.

But I can say that I know my stuff when it comes to more knowledge-oriented things.

The druids who teach me are actually afraid of me now, since I learn everything they teach me so quickly that they keep running out of material.

They say that if they let me, I'd end up making them talk all day every day, from morning to night.

Fergus, Astolfo, d'Eon...[sr]Galahad, who entrusted me with his power...
