They sure do like to keep busy, don't they. It's been less than a day since Paraíso came here; I don't think she'll be back again that soon.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Musashi
Oh well, I guess there's no harm in keeping security tight. That might help put the princess at ease too.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Musashi
Honestly, not really any good memories of defending a besieged castle. I mean, those battles kinda wear on you.
[k]

？1：Now now. I get it, but lets try to stay positive.
？2：We still don't know where their base is.

？！

[charaFace C 1]

＠Musashi
Wouldn't it be great if they were just all, “I shall await you at 'insert secret base location here'! MWA HA HA!” and then we could just find them!

[k]

She's a ninja. Even if she has transformed into a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, she will still do whatever it takes to carry out her master's commands.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
And she hasn't done that yet.
[k]

？1：You mean Kiyohime.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Exactly. Paraíso will do whatever it takes to try and kill her... I can feel it.

Yes, Master!

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
While we were slow to act given how large our numbers were, keeping our numbers small would be an invitation for the monsters to quickly adapt their strategy.

In which case, we must be able to respond in turn,[sr]until we get a better sense of the battlefield.

It's a good plan, stationing chains of command near[sr]Lady Kiyohime and keeping them safe.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

Indeed. Having her sleep out here in this wide-open space, and making sure it's heavily guarded...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
It may be an airtight plan as far as strategies go, but...
[k]

？1：...I feel sorry for her.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
As do I. I suppose it's all right now that she's asleep, but how will she feel when she wakes up?

The only ones who can handle her are probably me,[sr]Kotarou, [%1], and old man Tajima.
