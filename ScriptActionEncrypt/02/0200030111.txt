？1：The sky is clearing up...
？2：Are the sky and evil spirits connected somehow?

＠Onui
Whoa, I can't believe it![charaFace B 1][sr]That was amazing! You're so strong, Miss Samurai!
[k]

＠Onui
At first I thought those were ghosts, but since you were able to get rid of them and you're not a monk...
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Onui
I wonder if they were actually bandits or burglars or something.
[k]

＠B：Tasuke
Ga ga!

＠Onui
Oh, yeah, they did say that. I remember![sr]Back when Mom and Dad were still alive...

＠Onui
They always said to be careful at night[sr]'cause lots of bad things show up then!
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Onui
I don't remember if Mom and Dad said anything about shadowy things showing up when it gets really cloudy.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Onui
But I know they told us that's what happens at night.[sr]Grandpa said so too!

Hmm... Although, I still don't know why bandits showed up here, and when it's not even night!

They didn't look like bandits to me.[sr]What about you?
[k]

？1：I thought they totally looked like bandits.

[charaFace A 8]

＠Musashi
...Really?
[k]

？2：Same. They didn't look like bandits at all!

[charaFace A 4]

＠Musashi
Right?
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
Either way, now we know they show up so often that they get mistaken for bandits.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Musashi
So there's a castle that's not supposed to be here, and evil spirits stalking fields like wild animals.
[k]

＠Musashi
I've wandered into time periods like that before, but this one seems especially dangerous.
[k]

＠Musashi
It looks to be as bad as Onigashima,[sr]where we first met, or maybe even worse...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
Anyway, for now,[sr]let's go pay Onui's house a visit.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Musashi
I'm still hungry, and we have to get her and Tasuke back home safely!
