＠Kiso Yoshinaka
I cannot overlook the Taira clan's tyranny.[sr]I doubt they will stop at ravaging the city.
[k]

＠Kiso Yoshinaka
If they are not stopped, they will ruin all of Japan. Someone must stand up to them. Someone must fight.
[k]

＠Kiso Yoshinaka
I will not fight for the Genji's sake. I will fight so that all who live in this world can do so in peace.
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
That's so selfless of you, Lord Yoshinaka.
[k]

＠Kiso Yoshinaka
It is, isn't it.
[k]

＠Kiso Yoshinaka
...Hahaha, as well it should be.[sr]I was trying to say something selfless, after all.
[k]

＠Kiso Yoshinaka
If anyone were to ask me why I do this,[sr]that shall be my answer.
[k]

＠Tomoe Gozen
Lord Yoshinaka...?
[k]

＠Kiso Yoshinaka
But I will be completely honest with you, Tomoe.[sr]The real reason I will fight the Taira clan...
[k]

＠Kiso Yoshinaka
...is to make a brighter future for us.[sr]That is all.
[k]

＠Kiso Yoshinaka
I fight, Tomoe, so that one day, the fires of war[sr]will no longer burn...and we can be together.
[k]

＠
Why?
[k]

＠
Why did I ever forget this?[sr]I...
[k]

＠
I know that he gave me something precious.[sr]Not just hatred, or anger, or detestation.
[k]

＠
That's why I managed to survive. Back then, when Yoshitsune came for Lord Yoshinaka on Yorimoto's orders...
[k]

＠
Lord Yoshinaka asked me to stay[sr]far away from the battlefield.
[k]

＠
Because of how he cared for me, my life was spared.
[k]

＠
In time, I went on to give birth to our son, Yoshihide. Afterward I became a nun, and grew old while continuing to pray that Lord Yoshinaka would rest in peace.
[k]

＠
Yes... I could have sworn I died[sr]peacefully, while praying.
[k]

＠
So then, why...?
[k]

＠
Why did I... How could I ever forget seeing[sr]Lord Yoshinaka smile at the sunset like this...?

[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
I remember now...
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
You smiled at me so bashfully, Lord Yoshinaka.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
I loved that smile of yours. I would never forget it.[sr]At least, I thought I never would.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
Resentment, hatred, anger...
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
I thought I had let all of it go. I never thought[sr]they would flare up and drive me to such madness.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
How mortifying...[sr]But...

...According to legend, Tomoe Gozen could fell a hawk[sr]with her bow, or split a large tree with her sword.
[k]

＠Musashi
They were right. I could never have beaten[sr]her without the Myoujingiri Muramasa.
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Musashi
Rest in peace, Lady Inferno.

You did it. The monsters are scattering. The samurai should be able to deal with them before nightfall now.

Tomoe Gozen was a truly fearsome foe...but I knew that you and Master would be able to defeat her, Lady Musashi. How sharp your techniques were.

I guess so, huh. In fact, they were pretty great, if I do say so myself! I deflected her arrows, and wove between every strike of her sword!

I didn't have a plan for dealing with her flames,[sr]but aside from that, I'd say I more than held my own!
