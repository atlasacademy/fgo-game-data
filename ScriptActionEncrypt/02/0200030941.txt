？2：I hope we can meet again under different circumstances.

Farewell. I hope that in your next life, you will meet someone who will persuade you that your doubt, and all your tears, are punishment enough.

I see the night's returning to normal.[sr]And that bloodred moon has gone away again.

[charaFace C 1]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Well done, Master. I have word from the castle[sr]doctor that the princess is safe and well.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
She was so exhausted both mentally and physically that she quickly fell asleep, but she should have no issue waking up tomorrow.
[k]

？1：You did great too, Kotarou.
？2：...Hey, aren't those kunai you've got there[line 2]?

？！

[charaFace C 0]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Oh, these?[sr]Yes, they're the kunai that Paraíso used.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I think she must have procured them here in Shimousa.[sr]They stayed around even after she disappeared.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I wouldn't exactly call them a trophy...[sr]I just found myself compelled to take them.

I don't see the harm in that. We can give them back once we find that evil sorcerer guy.

＠Musashi
Paraíso said something about Onriedo, right?[sr]I think in Buddhism, that word means[line 2]

＠Musashi
That actually sounds kind of nice in theory, but I definitely don't like the way they handle it in practice.
[k]

＠Musashi
And I really don't like how they just went around villages, either...
[k]

＠Musashi
And as long as we're on the subject, I'm seriously pissed off about how they're using Heroic Spirits as hollow vessels and trampling all over their pride.
[k]

＠Musashi
As if Lord Inshun wasn't bad enough, they did the[sr]same thing to Tomoe Gozen and Mochizuki Chiyome.
[k]

＠Musashi
I won't say we have to avenge them, but I think it's at least worth returning those kunai to the sorcerer in a way he can't possibly enjoy. Say, shoving them where the sun don't shine, y'know?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Musashi
...What do you say, Kotarou? [%1]?
[k]

？1：Yeah.
？2：We could even put a literal bow on them!
