＠H：Castle Staff
Please wait here.[sr]Lord Tajima and Lady Kiyohime will be with you shortly.
[k]

＠H：Castle Staff
Lady Kiyohime was overjoyed to hear about your arrival. However...
[k]

＠H：Castle Staff
I respectfully ask that you understand your place, and not take what she says at face value.
[k]

？1：Okay.
？2：Oh, don't worry about that one bit.

？！

＠H：Castle Staff
I must say though, I'm surprised to see people so young were responsible for slaying that monster.
[k]

＠H：Castle Staff
Lord Matsudaira said you must have trained very hard indeed, especially given that the world is at peace.

＠Musashi
Oh, I wouldn't go that far! I mean, I guess I am a bit stronger than most people you come across?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
But trust me, there are plenty of swordsmen out there who are waaay stronger.
[k]

＠Musashi
Of course, there are also people like Kotarou and [%1], who have a different sort of strength to them.
[k]

＠Musashi
But if we're strictly talking about martial arts,[sr]then I'd say old man Tajima is easily stronger than me.
[k]

＠H：Castle Staff
Well, of course he is.[sr]He's the invincible Yagyu Munenori.
[k]

＠H：Castle Staff
If we're discussing who the greatest swordmasters under the sun are, there are two names that come to mind.
[k]

＠H：Castle Staff
The first is Miyamoto Musashi, the master of dual-wielding. And the second is Edo's own Yagyuu Tajima.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Musashi
...I-is that so.
[k]

？1：I, uh, I see.
？2：So Musashi is famous even in the Edo period.

？！

＠H：Castle Staff
Edo period? If you mean the city of Edo, yes, I understand they talk about Miyamoto quite a bit there.
[k]

＠H：Castle Staff
Even now that the age of war is over, our lords still love to discuss who would win if Musashi and Yagyuu Tajima were ever to cross swords.

And I can personally attest to their combat prowess.

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
They put an end to the monster that attacked us. Indeed, many of my own men who were present at that battle are still singing their praises even now.

N-no, my lord. I-I would never dream of it.

＠Castle Warrior
Hahahaha, I was merely joking! Yes, I may have referred to them as untrustworthy strangers, but, uh...haha.
[k]

＠Castle Warrior
With the princess personally requesting their protection, and your endorsement of their skill, I have no objections!
[k]

＠Castle Warrior
Hahahahaha! Wh-why, it is most reassuring to[sr]have such upstanding young warriors helping us!

We've both been to all sorts of places, so what is it that makes us so different in that regard?

I agree. It seems very unlikely that this is a wholly[sr]new threat. It must be one of the remaining five.

＠Musashi
And given that this is imperial land that's fairly[sr]close to Edo, I doubt it's politically motivated.
