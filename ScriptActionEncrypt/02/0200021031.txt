Everyone, focus your efforts on the formation at eight o'clock! That's where their line is weakest!

Well, no matter. One of their Servants excelled at defense. That one must have defended the rabble as they fled, tails between their legs.

I see. About the same as our own casualties. It remains to be seen whether they will continue their struggle, or come to pledge their submission.

What shall we do with the men who surrendered?

＠Amazon
Our expanded territory has led to an increase in our population as well, so we are currently low on men. Perhaps we should send them to[line 2]

Those we captured for child-birthing when they first fell from the surface are one matter.
[k]

＠Berserker
But the seed of those who oppose us must be selected with care.
[k]

＠Berserker
Those who have surrendered to us out of fear are tainted with cowardice. Such must not be permitted to enter into our bloodline.
[k]

＠Berserker
However, if you find any men who we have defeated in honorable combat...
[k]

＠Berserker
Men who have lost their arms or legs, yet still glare at us as if to rip our throats out with their teeth given the chance...

Those I give you leave to bring back and use them as you will. However...
