On one island, I find a land of healthy indigenous people just waiting to be enslaved! On another island, a mountain of gold ready to be traded for glass beads!

You are of course welcome to join us. I can almost certainly find buyers who'd pay a great deal for slaves of your particular bent.

If they'd actually found our hideout, they wouldn't have just set it on fire.

They'd come after us with axes and swords and their war cry to finish us off for good.

Why? Because you useless good-for-nothings were practically shaking in your boots at the idea of facing the Amazons again, of course.
[k]

＠Columbus
When his crew's freaking out, a good captain uses every tool at his disposal to keep the ship moving.
[k]

＠Columbus
Sometimes he'll keep two separate logbooks. Other times he'll stretch the facts as far as they can go to claim that land is near.
[k]

＠Columbus
It was the same thing here. I had to burn it all down to keep you useless idiots moving forward.
[k]

＠Columbus
To make you steel yourselves and convince you that you had to keep fighting in order to survive.
[k]

＠Columbus
I couldn't have you little turds resigning yourselves to being their slaves after coming this far.

Naturally, I quickly realized that the men fed up with their lot in life here were my best bet.

＠Columbus
I have to say, you were a fine crew. Not one of you ever suspected I was anything less than altruistic.

I'm pretty used to putting down mutinies on my ships, so it was a pleasant surprise not to have to bother with that for you lot!
