＠Musashi
Onui and Tasuke are both fast asleep. After the day they had, I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't wake up until tomorrow.
[k]

＠Musashi
They must be exhausted after everything that happened,[sr]so we should let them rest for as long as they need.
[k]

？1：Onui is such a strong girl.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Musashi
She really is.[sr]And she's still so young, too.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Musashi
Hell, when I was her age...[sr][charaFace A 0]On second thought, never mind. Let's not get into that.
[k]

？2：Let's make them a big breakfast when they wake up!

[charaFace A 6]
＠Musashi
Great idea! I've got a special udon recipe I've been holding onto for just this sort of occasion!
[k]

＠Musashi
In fact, I just learned a really nice way to make udon dough while I was traveling around Sanuki recently.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Musashi
We can use dried fish for the soup stock... On second thought, maybe kombu would be the way to go...
[k]

？！

＠Musashi
...Oh, right, I've got something else to tell[sr]you before Grandpa Muramasa heads to his smithy.
[k]

＠Musashi
Basically, I have some thoughts about Saṃghāta Hell[sr]and Kālasūtra Hell that I thought I should share.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Musashi
In a word...they seemed kind of strange to me.
[k]

＠Musashi
I've faced oni several times before,[sr]not just in Onigashima.
[k]

＠Musashi
But I've never met any oni quite like them.[sr]Of course, they were still very oni-like. But...
[k]

＠Musashi
It was odd, talking with them like that. And then there's things like Saṃghāta Hell sticking her hand in your stomach without killing you.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Musashi
...How's your wound doing?[sr]It still hurts, doesn't it?
[k]

？1：Just a little. Kotarou's ointment really helped.
？2：It's healing fast thanks to Kotarou.

？！

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
Is that so.[sr]Are you just trying to tough it out?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Musashi
Are you seriously trying to make[sr]sure I don't worry about you?
[k]

＠Musashi
Or do you feel like you can't afford to let a little pain stop you when we still have two Swordmasters and their ringleader to fight?
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Musashi
...'Course, I guess it could be all of the above, huh?

In fact, I'd bet that's what it is. Even when all[sr]the odds are against you, you never back down.
[k]

＠Musashi
And it's not because you know you can always find a way to escape. It's because you never give up on life.
[k]

？1：...

[k]

＠Musashi
Well, I'm not about to back out either. Now that we've come this far, I'll stick with you to the end.
[k]

＠Musashi
If you wanna fight, I'll fight. If you wanna run, I'll join you. I'll follow you anywhere, even to another world.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
But you're not going to run away, are you?
[k]

？1：I still have things to do here.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Musashi
Hehe. I figured you'd say that!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
Not to mention we still have to fulfill our promise to[sr]Lord Inshun. We have to take care of everything that's threatening Shimousa!
[k]

？2：I still haven't paid Inshun back with interest.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Musashi
That's right. We promised him we would take care of everything that's threatening Shimousa, didn't we!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

？！

＠Musashi
I'm staying with you until that's done. Who will you[sr]face next? Who will you protect? Who will you save?
[k]

＠Musashi
I trust you to do whatever you think is right.[sr]Me, I'll just stick to fighting however I like!

＠Caster of Limbo
...The race for blood has reached its climax.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
Between Hitachi, Shimousa, the army slaughtered at the Arakawa River, and Sagami, there are now well over ten thousand humans dead.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
Through these massacres, the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters have spread regret and loathing across this world, even as they offered up their own souls upon their deaths.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
What a truly, truly, truly fantastic job they did!
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
Saṃghāta Hell, the Berserker oni![sr]Kālasūtra Hell, the motherly Rider!
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
I applaud you both for your excellent work! You have proven your foolishness and been utterly humiliated beyond compare!
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
Fantastic! No wonder you both left[sr]your marks as heroes of humanity!
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
You were both excellent role models for Anti-Heroes everywhere. Fantastic. Splendid! Wonderful!

They fight so they may live![sr]They struggle so they may live!

＠Caster of Limbo
Ahh, such contemptible, righteous souls...![sr]They are the spitting image of Seimei himself!

That is as it should be.[sr]Our opponents should strive for nothing less.

The way you say that makes it sound like you have a lot of faith in them, Lord Sorcerer.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
If you've run out of other pawns, does this mean I'm up next?
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
I was all set to rot away in the mountains.[sr]You're the one who brought me back.
[k]

＠Longsword Swordsman
I never had any attachment to life. If you want to send me out next, I'll be happy to go out in a blaze of glory.

No need. All you need concern yourself with is remaining by my side. Besides, if you were to go out...

The time is already upon us. With the race for blood finished, Onriedo will soon be complete!
[k]

＠Sorcerer
As a Holy Grail, Onriedo shall collect the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters' souls. It has already collected five, even as they have brought many other souls with them.
[k]

＠Sorcerer
Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, your ultimate purpose is to die. You are not here to prove your prowess with a sword.
[k]

＠Sorcerer
You harbor bloodstained blades within your souls.[sr]Go forth, kill, and die!

＠Sorcerer
Only two of you remain![sr]I am of course speaking to you, Limbo and Empireo!
[k]

＠Sorcerer
Even after I embedded your souls with the Curse of Annihilation, you have retained your sense of self! Your blades are tainted beyond redemption, with none of a Heroic Spirit's pride!
[k]

＠Sorcerer
Now go, and fulfill your final duty! Once you have,[sr]my Onriedo will manifest here in Shimousa!

You have neither pride to lose, nor a soul to taint! No wonder you have attained such beauty... It is more than I can bear!

＠Caster of Limbo
Now that your blade has fallen as far as it can go, tainted beyond repair, I look forward to seeing where it leads you!
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
May you have an excellent slaughter,[sr]and an excellent death.
