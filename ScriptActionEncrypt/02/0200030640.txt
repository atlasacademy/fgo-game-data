Lord Yoshinaka fought for the people.[sr]He stood up against the Taira's arrogance.
[k]

＠
He thought he was doing what was right. He was trying to create a peaceful world, even if he had to take others' lives to do so.
[k]

＠
Kiso Yoshinaka was my beloved hero, a peerless warrior. He fought alongside the Genji to free them from the tyranny of the Taira.
[k]

＠
He fought, and fought, and fought...
[k]

＠
And yet, even after the Taira had been defeated, this new world hated Lord Yoshinaka.
[k]

＠
The very instant the Genji were in power in Kyoto, they betrayed him! Even after he had fought by their side, they said he was evil!

Detest. Detest. Detest. Detest. Detest. Detest.[sr]I hate. I hate. Hate. Hate. Hate. Hate. Hate.

I detest the Genji clan for betraying Lord Yoshinaka.[sr]I loathe the people of Japan for not accepting him.
[k]

＠
I detest everything about this world![sr]I am overcome with loathing. It shall never go away!

This is truly hell. There is no other word for it! Contemptible worms grow in number and size, while good people are nowhere to be found!

I too must have died, and made a mark on humanity.

＠
I have materialized in this world as a shadow of my former self.
[k]

＠
But then...why do I still fester with hatred? When I was alive, I hid myself away and lived out the rest of my days in peace once the war came to an end.
[k]

＠
So why do I now burn so fiercely? Is it because I'm a Heroic Spirit? Is it the way I've materialized? No, no no no, it's something else!
[k]

＠
Why? Why! Why!?
[k]

＠
Why was it not enough for me to shed tears over losing the one I loved? What is this urge I have to use myself as firewood!?
[k]

＠
Detestation. Anger. The Curse of Annihilation inside me drives me wildly mad. With the fire growing unchecked, now is the time to turn things around!
[k]

＠
Ahh...
[k]

＠
I have finally disgraced myself to the point where I can fall no further.
[k]

＠
...I have become a demon. My illness has advanced to the point where I can no longer be around others.

？1：Yoshinaka...?

[charaFace C 5]

＠Musashi
The only Yoshinaka I can think of off the top of my head is Kiso Yoshinaka, one of the greatest generals from hundreds of years ago!
[k]

？2：Kiso Yoshinaka was a shogun in the Kamakura period!

[charaFace C 5]

＠Musashi
You really know your stuff, [%1]!
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 11]

＠Musashi
So if she had ties to Yoshinaka...I see. Makes sense.[sr]I can understand why she would hate all of Japan.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Musashi
All the more so now that things are peaceful in the Tokugawa reign, since the Tokugawa family is supposed to be descended from the Seiwa Genji.
[k]

[charaFace C 12]

＠Musashi
Kiso Yoshinaka was a general who helped Minamoto Yoritomo overthrow the Taira regime. He was once lauded as a great general, but ended up being persecuted by Yoritomo after he had outlived his usefulness.
[k]

＠Musashi
I've heard his name before. As well as his beloved wife's, who was always by his side.

＠Musashi
She was a courageous woman, and an incredibly skilled warrior. An armor-clad battle maiden who fought better than any man.
[k]

＠Musashi
The daughter of Nakahara Kaneto, and the younger[sr]sister of Higuchi Kanemitsu and Imai Kanehira.
[k]

＠Musashi
The one who always fought by Yoshinaka's side, yet couldn't bear witness to his death.
[k]

＠Musashi
...That's who you are, isn't it? A woman who burns with hatred and detestation...Tomoe Gozen.
[k]

？1：She defended Uruk at the Demonic Front!
？2：Why is she doing all this now?

？！

[charaFace C 5]

＠Musashi
It must be the karma implanted by that Curse thing. Her soul has been dead for a long time, just like Lord Inshun.
[k]

＠Musashi
The thing in front of us now is nothing more than a husk[line 2]the vestiges of what Tomoe Gozen the Servant used to be. At least, that's how I see it.
[k]

＠Musashi
But no matter how tragic her story is, or how justified her anger may be, I'm not going to hold back.
[k]

[charaFace C 12]

＠Musashi
(...That's right. I won't hold back at all.[sr]I can't afford to against her, anyway.)
[k]

＠Musashi
(I refuse to take pity on her. But, can I still defeat her? This katana may be up to the task, but my skills sure aren't.)
[k]

＠Musashi
(It's not her soul I need to cut...it's her karma. I have to sever her grudge itself. And my skills haven't reached a point where I can do that!)
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Musashi
But so what! I should be thrilled I get to go up against Tomoe Gozen!
[k]

＠Musashi
This is a once in a lifetime chance to prove myself against an unrivaled master! If I back down now, it would bring shame to my Niten Ichiryu style!
[k]

＠Musashi
The only thing I need to worry about doing to this flame in human clothing is to cut it down with my crossed blades!
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Musashi
I'm glad I brought you with me, Myoujingiri Muramasa![sr]Now come on, Inferno! It's time we settled this!
