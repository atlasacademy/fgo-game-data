I was concerned about how Senpai would be received here, so I checked our historical records.

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
The late 17th century was also the tail end of the Age of Exploration. At the time, most of the interest in colonization had moved to the New World.
[k]

＠Mash
But Europe already had a strong connection[sr]to Asia, thanks to the East India Company.
[k]

＠Mash
They regularly imported spices from Southeast Asia, textiles from India, and tea and ceramics from China.
[k]

＠Mash
So since Salem was a British colony, and would later go on to be a thriving port town with lots of trade...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
...the people here may not exactly see Asians every day, but they also shouldn't be so unusual that it would make them distrust us.

[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
...since Senpai has a strong connection[sr]to all the Servants still at Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
However, this method makes use of a back door[line 2]a by-product of sorts that happens when Sheba acts up...
