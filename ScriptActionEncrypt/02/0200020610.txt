(Huff, huff) ...

＠???
...Haha. You were quite good.

＠???
No other man I've called up here has satisfied me like you have. They either tired out far too quickly, or completely lacked technique.

＠Man
R-really? I-I'm honored...

(Yes! Since I was able to satisfy her,[sr]I don't have to worry about them killing me!)

You've treated me to such wonderful sights this evening. Your lovely face as you latched on to my breasts like a baby.
[k]

＠???
Your lovely face as you closed your eyes and desperately pleaded for your own sweet release...
[k]

＠???
Your handsome face as you barely kept from screaming in pain...
[k]

＠???
Thank you. I had a wonderful time.[sr]This will be a lovely memory.
[k]

＠Man
N-not at all. I'm the one who should be thanking you. Please feel free to call on me again whenever[line 2]
[k]

＠???
There's just one last thing I'd like to see from you before we call it a night.
[k]

＠???
Do you know what that is?
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_11 2.0]
＠???
The look of despair on your face as, even after all I've just told you, I end your life.

Do you know what my only two teachings are?

Take whatever you want, whenever you want it...and do not want what you have taken.

There's no shortage of possibilities or replacements.[sr]I'll always get to try someone new.

After all, you can't take what you already own.

So I'll keep on taking everything I don't have.[sr]Everything I desire.

And when I'm done, I'll throw it all away.[sr]What a wonderful way to live...

I can't even tell if they've been thrown out or not.[sr]Many of them seem as though they could still be used.

It seems as if they were thrown out after only being used once, not because they were no longer functional.
