...As their blades clashed, their power and technique seemed evenly matched.
[k]

＠
No, not only that. Their skills had now surpassed everything[line 2]time, space, existence, essence... Each was the other's perfect mirror image.
[k]

[wt 0.7]

＠
One, the zero sword, attempting to surpass Munisai's peerless “one”. The culmination of a life spent pursuing a single answer.
[k]

＠
Faced with untold options, it carefully evaluates, crushes, and discards each of them.
[k]

＠
A finite skill that only arrives at a single correct answer.
[k]

＠
A blade that shaves existence down to a single possibility, the ultimate extreme, remaining only as a “something.”
[k]

＠
That is Musashi's zero; a sword designed to bring about an inescapable end, even against gods or the Buddha.

＠
The other, a sword that becomes one with endlessness.[sr]A path that accepts countless possibilities.
[k]

＠
Ordinarily, given the limits of time and space,[sr]only a single slash can be made at any given moment.
[k]

＠
His sword accepts that, and at the same time[sr]creates many other answers: a sword of infinity.
[k]

＠
A strike that pushes its existence to the ultimate transparency, only to still have something to hold on to.
[k]

＠
That is Kojirou's Swallow Reversal; a sword designed to create a future that not even gods nor the Buddha could evade.

The realm of the infinite.[sr]Or, alternatively, the realm of nothingness.

Here, there is no time, no space,[sr]no fate, no good, and no evil.

It is devoid of thought or feeling; a place that only those who have achieved true mastery with their blades can reach.

Or, alternatively, it is a dream; a vision of hell that all villains see before they die.

Their swords cross but for a moment, yet in[sr]that moment, infinite possibilities play out.
[k]

＠
How long will they stay here, alone, attempting to kill each other? Their duel seems as though it will continue forever, with no end in sight.
[k]

＠
This is not a world. It is neither a Chronicle Theoretical Phenomenon, nor a Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon.[sr]It is something beyond even the rift of reality and dreams.
[k]

＠
An impossible domain, where infinity and zero clash endlessly.
[k]

And yet.[sr]And yet.

There is another one here...who observes them.

In this clash between fighters,[sr]there can be only one victor.

So who will you watch? Who is the swordsman you[sr]will stand beside as they bask in their victory?

＠
Who will it be...?
[k]

Who is it you hold in your gaze?

Then it is decided! As you watch over them, in this instant, the zero sword shall defeat the infinite sword!

Now that I have finally experienced this,[sr]I think I will go on ahead.

Or perhaps I will disappear into a rift that shall never see the light of day, and be done with it.

If there is someone in the Throne of Heroes, even just one man, who resembles me, I wish I could share this experience with him.

I don't know what I was thinking, fighting a duel in a castle going up in flames. Now here I am, without the strength to run away. What a fool I am.

You know...
[k]

＠Musashi
Just this morning, when I was looking up at the sky...[sr]I decided I'd accept whatever happened to me.
[k]

＠Musashi
I thought, if it helped me reach the void...zero...[sr]I would try doing something I usually don't.
[k]

＠Musashi
Even if I embarrassed myself, and people pointed and laughed at me...I'd give it my all, and see where it led.
[k]

＠Musashi
Of course...I didn't think everything would go this perfectly overnight...
[k]

＠Musashi
...or that someone would be here with me through it all.
