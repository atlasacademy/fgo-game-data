Um, [%1], can I ask you something? The reason we were able to beat those spirits so much more easily than the others isn't because they were going easy on us...
[k]

＠Musashi
It's because we had help this time, right?

＠Musashi
What I mean is, unless I'm wrong, your allies[sr]did most of the work this time, right?
