In brief, Ys was once the name of a city built on the coast.

It flourished as a haven of vice and immorality, but one day, either by an act of God or the Devil, the entire city was swallowed up by the sea.

Take whatever you want, whenever you want...and do not want what you have taken.

？1：Isn't that contradictory?

[charaFace E 1]
＠Dahut
Not at all.[sr]To put it another way...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

You are encouraged to take whatever you want without a second thought, but not to get too attached.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Dahut
That is all.
[k]

＠Dahut
Desire is supreme.[sr]You must never deny yourself what you want.
[k]

＠Dahut
What's more, not getting attached applies as much to what you've taken as to anything else.
[k]

＠Dahut
There is no point in holding on to something out of habit. Just let it go. No regrets. After all, someone else is bound to want whatever it is.
[k]

In essence, my teaching is this: in each and every moment, think only of what you want, and take it.

You seek this happiness for yourselves. It is what you desire, and so you're here to take it from me.
[k]

＠Dahut
But...as I always discard all that I desire, the only thing I truly possess is myself.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]
＠Dahut
Which means...you desire me.[sr]You came here to propose.

I'd tell her she's waaay off the mark, but something tells me she's not the type to listen!

Then yes, I accept. I will always desire people with love in their hearts who seek my hand in marriage.
[k]

＠Dahut
Very well, then! Come, let us go to bed and each take our desires from the other.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]
＠Dahut
...Of course, it should go without saying that I will discard you once I am sated.
[k]

＠Dahut
That is the perfect happiness of the moment. Taking what we desire is how we obtain ultimate happiness.

...I've never seen any woman as strong and terrible as her before.
[k]

＠Fergus
Maybe my future self will meet many like her in Ulster...
[k]

＠Fergus
...but right now, she's the first woman of this sort I've ever encountered.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Fergus
Still...I can't help but shudder. I never met someone so strong and up front about her desires!
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Fergus
...I'm ashamed of myself.
[k]

＠Fergus
How can I still be incapable of battling such a fierce opponent simply because she's a woman!?
[k]

？1：Just protect me like usual. I'm counting on you!

Well that's too bad. Some of you would have shined like gems with a little training... But I suppose you just aren't ready to handle me.
[k]

＠Dahut
Then again, there really are a lot of you, aren't there. Not even I could handle all of you by myself.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Dahut
So I shall call some of my maids to keep the rest of you company. Naturally, you're free to take them for yourself if you so desire.
