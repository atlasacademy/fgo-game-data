I'm glad to see her in high spirits again, but...
[k]

？1：She's still not completely healed?
？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Yes and no. Her exam results were all perfect.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Her cell structure has rejuvenated to that of a teenager, and her nerves and blood vessels are like new.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
But the nonhuman parts of her...[sr]That's another story.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The enormous magical energy she possessed as a Demi-Servant is gone, and her magical circuits have jammed.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
You've learned a lot about magecraft over the last year, so you know that magical circuits last for life.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Whenever a mage uses a spell, they flip a switch to turn on the magical circuits inside their body.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This activates them and voilà! They can cast spells.[sr]When they don't need them, they flip the switch back.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Basically, the switch is always there, and your ability to use spells depends on whether it's on or off.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
But right now, there's no way to turn Mash's circuits on, even though the circuits themselves are fine.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's kind of like the switch is jammed, and can't be flipped.
[k]

？1：Does that mean she's sick, or...?

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
No. I give you my personal, universal genius guarantee that there is nothing wrong with her physically.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She's the very picture of health.[sr]You have my word as the world's most eminent artist.
[k]

？2：Does Mash know about this?

[charaFace C 1]
＠Da Vinci
Of course. Patients have a right to know about their condition nowadays.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She was puzzled by this abnormality with her magical circuits too, but she was glad to learn she's healthy.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Anyway, we'll just have to wait and see what happens.[sr]Don't worry. It'll sort itself out eventually.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
I'd add, though, that it might be a good idea for Mash to get out a bit more.
[k]

We must've overloaded their poor minds with the sheer quantity of data we've gathered over the last year.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Between Chaldea summons and on-site summons, we easily called upon more than a hundred Servants.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And then there was us visiting Singularities in seven different eras, and the ten-plus Rayshifts to minor Singularities in between.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
Normally, a Rayshift is a major event, and requires approval from the Mage's Association AND the UN!

Are you kidding me!?
[k]

＠Staff B
Hey, don't shoot the messenger. As soon as the first team gets here, they're going to shake things up with the staff.
[k]

＠Staff B
Looks like they're foisting a bunch of well-known mages from all sorts of fields on us.
[k]

＠Staff B
We still don't have the complete list, but here's a few we know are coming:
[k]

＠Staff B
Augustus Henrik Asplund, from Valuay.[sr]Krast Rene Wegner, from Kishur.
[k]

＠Staff B
Valeia Siciliphi, from Mystile.[sr]And...Misaria Crowlum, from Chimera.
[k]

＠Staff B
As if that weren't bad enough, it sounds like Policies is getting involved too. They're talking about completely overhauling Chaldea while they analyze the data.
[k]

＠Staff A
A perfect storm of aristocracy, neutrality, and democracy. What gives them the right to[line 2]
[k]

＠Staff B
Lev Lainur.
[k]

＠Staff A
Oh...
[k]

＠Staff B
You remember how he served as an advisor, right?
[k]

＠Staff B
There's every possibility he had an accomplice, and it's entirely possible that if he did, they are still out there.
[k]

＠Staff B
That's why we've got a target on our backs.
[k]

＠Staff B
We are all under suspicion for an act of terrorism that put 38 top-tier mages in comas.
[k]

＠Staff B
And we can't ask the Animuspheres for help, since they're still in upheaval after Olga Marie's death.
[k]

＠Staff B
First, they need to designate the family that divided the Animusphere Origin Crest as the new successor, and get the other families' consent.
[k]

＠Staff B
Once that's done, they have to complete all the rituals and get the various approvals needed for succession before they can finally come to Chaldea.
[k]

＠Staff B
So by the time that happens, we'll either have lost all of our authority, or, in the worst case...
[k]

＠Staff B
They'll ignore all our achievements, freeze Chaldea's assets, and seal everything away...including us.
[k]

＠Staff A
Dammit! If only Dr. Roman were still alive...
[k]

＠Staff B
Come on, we've wasted enough time talking about this.
[k]

＠Staff B
Besides, I want to doctor [%1]'s file while I still can.
[k]

＠Staff B
And you, along with a few other people, are going to help me.
[k]

＠Staff A
Huh? Why should I!?
[k]

＠Staff B
Okay, listen, let me put it to you like this:
[k]

＠Staff B
Do you really think they'll believe that a Master with no experience, who showed up on the day of the attack just to fill an empty space on the roster...
[k]

＠Staff B
...was able to command SEVERAL different Servants, AND take on the actual heroes of all the time periods [&he:she] visited...
[k]

＠Staff B
...alone, without a modicum of support?
[k]

＠Staff B
And finally, that when the dust settled, [&he:she] had actually managed to restore humanity? Because even I don't believe it!
[k]

＠Staff B
We shouldn't even be alive right now! But we are, and it's all thanks to [&him:her]!
[k]

＠Staff A
Well... I...
[k]

＠Staff B
...Listen, I'm sorry.
[k]

＠Staff B
It's just, when you stop and think about what [%1] has accomplished... It's...unbelievable.
[k]

＠Staff B
So much so that the Mage's Association, Chaldea included, may get caught up in political infighting.
[k]

＠Staff B
No. I'm sure they will. And before it's over, someone's going to...get disappeared.
[k]

＠Staff B
So that's why I want to edit [%1]'s information while I still can, even just a little bit.
[k]

＠Staff B
For example, we could have it say “Chaldea's backup was in fine shape, even after the terrorist attack.”
[k]

＠Staff B
“This amateur Master we've been relying on was never more than a way to maintain Servant contracts.”
[k]

＠Staff B
“Dr. Roman was the one who handled all of the complex matters, including the hero negotiations...” And so on.
[k]

＠Staff B
...I know this is wrong. It'll even end up disgracing [%1]'s name.
[k]

＠Staff B
But... [&He's:She's] been fighting alongside us for over a year now.
[k]

＠Staff B
Don't you want to make sure [&he:she] has a future?
[k]

＠Staff A
...Okay, I'm in. Where do we start?
[k]

＠Staff B
Let's start with Orleans, where the First Singularity was...

＠D：Staff A
I can't pinpoint the Singularity's location![sr]It appears to be confined to an incredibly small area!
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
Analyze its wavelength! Find out if it's similar to the other Singularities!
[k]

＠D：Staff A
...I've found it! It's 74% similar to Singularity F!
[k]

[charaFace C 2]
＠Da Vinci
Okay, now filter the analysis to major Japanese cities! ...How long will that take!?
[k]

＠D：Staff A
Give me five minutes!
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠D：Staff B
I've got Sheba's observation results!
[k]

＠D：Staff B
Foundation of Humanity fluctuation is over thirty percent! Almost the same as the seven Singularities.
[k]

＠D：Staff B
Although... That's strange. Something's...off.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
Off? Off how?
[k]

＠D：Staff B
I-I'm sorry! It may just be my imagination!
[k]

＠D：Staff B
I've seen seven Singularities over the past year, and something about this new one just strikes me as...odd.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Don't dismiss your intuition. I want you to think about what it is until you remember!
[k]

＠D：Staff B
Y-yes ma'am![sr]I'll start comparing the singularities right away!

＠D：Staff A
...I've got it now![sr]It's in Tokyo...in the Shinjuku ward!

＠D：Staff A
The year is...1999!
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
1999... I don't remember any historic events taking place then.

No, it was a perfectly ordinary year. There were no events that could result in a Singularity but...

＠Da Vinci
Yes, we know. This shouldn't even be possible.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
Goetia is gone, and the seven Singularities were all repaired. However...one thing always bothered me.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The fact that Singularities pose a threat from the moment of their occurrence.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Look, you've been going around quashing every little Singularity that popped up this past year, right?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Those occurred because the emergence of the seven Singularities created some major time distortions, which in turn affected other timelines.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And just because the seven Singularities were repaired doesn't mean those distortions simply disappear.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Da Vinci
That said, I couldn't have foreseen that until the appearance of another Singularity on par with those.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...Any way you slice it, this is not good.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
And to make matters worse, the people the Mage's Association was supposed to send still aren't here!
[k]

？1：Which means...
？！

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
You got it! [%1], we have no choice but to ask you to repair this Singularity as well.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I've already told the UN and Association that this'll be part of the Demon God Pillar incident cleanup.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They weren't totally on board with it, but they should be satisfied once we send them the data.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

So on that note, [%1], it's time for you to step up and save the world again!

[k]

[k]

＠Da Vinci
It looks like this new Singularity is just as abnormal as the other seven.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
I think so too.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]
＠Mash
But...that's exactly why I think Senpai[line 2]I mean,[sr]Master[line 2]shouldn't go.

＠Da Vinci
No, you're not wrong.

＠Da Vinci
But, the fact remains...[charaFace C 1]that right now, [%1] is the only Master we've got!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Thankfully, we still have some Servants here too. I'll Rayshift them along with you, so you won't have to worry about anything while you get to the bottom of this.
[k]

So that's where we stand.

[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Mash, you should have a good idea what Romani's role was by now, right?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You need to verify [%1]'s existence so that [&he doesn't:she doesn't] disappear.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[&His:Her] vitals will be in a constant state of flux. Don't take your eyes off them; if any start to show abnormal values, edit them immediately.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You won't be able to sleep until things calm down.[sr]In some ways, this may be harder than Rayshifting.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But no matter how dire it gets, focus on your Master's data and keep validating [&his:her] existence.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Da Vinci
That's the best thing you can do for [%1] right now.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
How about it? Are you up for it?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

Even if I can't go with you, I'll be right there in spirit.[sr]Please...[charaFace A 13]make sure you come back safely, Senpai!

[charaFace A 8]
