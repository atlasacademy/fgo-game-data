I do. He is the son of Yagyu Sekishuusai and the father of Yagyu Jubei; a famous swordsman who left his mark on history.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
He was a genius with the sword, and the strongest swordsman of his time in Edo. The third shogun is said to have said he was invincible.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
He is also a strategic genius. He saw the threat posed[sr]by the Shimabara Rebellion long before anyone else.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Some even think that if the shogunate had sent him to Shimabara right away, he would have brought the rebellion to an end much sooner.

One of his most famous deeds was when he was protecting the second shogun, Hidetada, during the Siege of Osaka...

I see your penchant for gab remains as strong as ever.

It also seems you have new consorts now.[sr]And ones that are as eccentric as you at that.

It's no fault of yours. His sword ki is incredible. Even as a Servant, it was enough to make my hair stand on end.

You're a big shot on an important mission now, right? You were pretty classy during your speech earlier; don't mess that up now.

He's just a man whose sword reaches the gods. If a human can manage to truly master something, they can become a god unto themselves.
