Looks like they ambushed us from a waterway we hadn't discovered. Guess our scouting wasn't sufficient.

...Good question.
[k]

＠Rider
The survivors here and the relief group on the way can take care of this place. The rest of us will keep heading for Ys.
[k]

＠Rider
Now that we've reduced their numbers, they'll be spread that much thinner at their home base.
[k]

＠Rider
So we'll take advantage of that to sneak in and eliminate their leader.

[charaFace F 5]
＠Rider
It's the least I can do to avenge the men who gave their lives here.

Okay, so our destination is still the same.[sr]Just no rest stop on the way now.

You know, there's something they said that's still nagging at me.
[k]

＠Fergus
Didn't they refer to the ruler of Ys as the Pirate Princess?
[k]

？1：That kind of sounds like Drake...

I agree.[sr]Her name keeps coming to my mind as well.

However, I can't imagine her ruling over a band of horrid pirates like this...

Perhaps it's just my own naivete that I can't imagine a country ruled by a Pirate Princess.

Still, that doesn't mean I should just ignore it.[sr]I have to see what it's like for myself.

If I'm ever going to become king myself one day, I should know how other countries are run. It's like another kind of training.

If you just GOTTA say, “I bet the lady pirates like to dock on the port side, if ya know what I mean,” or something else terrible like that...
