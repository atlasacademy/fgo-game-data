A lone white dog runs throughout a Shinjuku in chaos. Someone tries to catch it, but soon gives up.
[k]

＠
For reasons unknown, Shinjuku is once again becoming part of our world.

＠
The strange things that inhabit it should disappear in time.

＠
Not a howl of grief, nor of anger, but simply as its heart willed.
[k]

＠
It tipped back its head, and howled once more.
