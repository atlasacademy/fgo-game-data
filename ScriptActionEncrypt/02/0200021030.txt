I see you are underestimating them, merely because they are men.
[k]

＠Berserker
Then I shall remind you: pathetic men though they are, they are still enemies. And we proud Amazons do not hold back against our enemies.
[k]

＠Berserker
That is how we do battle!
[k]

＠Berserker
Weak enemies allow us to show our strength. Strong enemies are a chance for us to refine our skills.
[k]

＠Berserker
Whatever our enemy, we are to relish the opportunity they provide. Thus, as your queen, I command you now:
[k]

＠Berserker
...Roar.

I'm afraid so. Once they began this war cry, they became far more formidable opponents!

Their strength, speed, agility, and durability have all increased. They no longer even feel pain!

Um...if you would like to know a good way to beg for your life, I can think of thirty different methods.

＠Scheherazade
I believe that one used among a subset of African tribes which involves opening your mouth and raising both hands high up at an angle...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Scheherazade
...may be the best way of indicating our surrender to them, with a three percent chance of success.
[k]

？1：That sounds like...Rome!
？2：I think that might only make them more upset!
？！

[charaFace E 4]
＠Scheherazade
True, they could well end up interpreting that stance in a different way altogether.
[k]

This really is a difficult problem.[sr]Perhaps dogeza is still the safest option after all.
