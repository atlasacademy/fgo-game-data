＠Sorcerer
...The time has come.
[k]

＠Sorcerer
The dark Jesuit sorcery I have performed here in the Katori Shrine has born luscious fruit indeed.
[k]

＠Sorcerer
I now control seven knights from across time and space!
[k]

＠Sorcerer
They are the shadows of figures who have made their mark on humanity. They are neither ghosts, nor evil spirits, nor vengeful specters.
[k]

＠Sorcerer
Nor, of course, are they Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Sorcerer
They are Seven Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, each of whom carries a blade made to cut this world to pieces!

＠Caster of Limbo
Indeed, indeed. Now that we Heroic Spirits summoned by the Holy Grail have been paired with your sorcery...
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
...these seven knights, infused with my Curse of Annihilation, have become rare and exceptional beings.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
They shall become your hands, they shall obey your every command, and cut down everything in their path.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
They cannot be hurt, killed, or defeated by any manner of blade. They will merely rage on, killing every living thing they can find.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
There are none in this entire plane of existence who can stop these tempests in human form.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
The world of humans will end.[sr]There will be no salvation.
