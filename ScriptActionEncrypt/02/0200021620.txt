Allow me to tell you one of my traits.[sr]Now that I am a Servant, no king can kill me.

After all, the reason I became a Heroic Spirit is because[sr]I avoided death at a king's hands.

It's clear that this Singularity took shape by combining with your Noble Phantasm.

But what sort of magical energy could you possibly put together to make that work? How in the world did you manage the resources? The design?

...He's the one who told me how it would work.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
I was to summon Servants to an enclosed underground world, and have them fight one another.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Such an environment would naturally lead to conflict. The more twisted, the better.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
So I decided to use a conquistador with unabashedly twisted desires as the base of its design.

Conflict between Servants would lead to a vortex of magical energy. On top of that...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
The enclosed nature of the underground Singularity enabled it to trap the vanquished Servants' souls...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
...and continuously exploit the energy generated as they attempted to return to the Throne.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
That was the goal. It would then use that abundant energy to slowly make my story into reality.

[k]

？1：...!
？！

＠Scheherazade
A Holy Grail War that exists only as a twisted story, where no one attempts to seek the Grail.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
But before I knew it, the Holy Grail had already materialized in the form of a story come to life.
