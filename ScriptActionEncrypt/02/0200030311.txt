I don't know why you ended up this way.[sr]Well, not exactly.

＠Musashi
At least I know it happened because you helped us escape. One of us had to stay behind, after all.

There, good as new. You can cut our heads off all you like with those pathetic little knives of yours; it affects us not the least bit.

So you were testing your newfound immortality, huh. In other words, you could have avoided it if you wanted, but you chose to let me cut off your head.
