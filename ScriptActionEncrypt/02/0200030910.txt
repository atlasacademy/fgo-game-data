...Everything is going exactly as we planned.

＠Caster of Limbo
Our two ninja are the key.[sr]Paraíso and Danzo have both done their jobs well.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
The groundwork for Onriedo is now as good as laid. Hehehe.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
Soon, the glory of Lucifer, the great Satan himself, will be known far and wide, and Onriedo will stand tall upon this ground!

＠Caster of Limbo
Correct. The Lord Sorcerer has treaded the path of chaos and carnage to attain these secret mystical arts.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
It is through these arts that Heroic Spirits and karma were fused together to produce the Curse of Annihilation.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
We Heroic Spirit Swordmasters kill and slaughter.[sr]We will consume the world itself.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
If I could speak without fear of being misunderstood, I would say that we Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are beings designed expressly for the destruction of humanity.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
We sow death merely by existing.[sr]With a single breath, we spread curses.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
This means Lord Satan himself has seen fit to bestow his protection upon us! Now, it is only a matter of time until our Lord Sorcerer's wish is granted!

Much like a curse, our goal must be realized as though we are slowly choking our enemy with a silk cord.

＠Caster of Limbo
Slowly, painstakingly, without mercy.[sr]Roughly, brutally, without mercy.

＠Sorcerer
Vengeful souls of those you have killed and harvested... Souls dripping with magical energy upon your own deaths...
[k]

＠Sorcerer
They are all valuable. They will all serve as the foundations for my ambition, and help create Onriedo in Shimousa so very soon.
[k]

＠Sorcerer
Paraíso has done an excellent job. The humans' hearts have been tainted with fear and dread, and have gained a hue fitting for their final days.

Now, forty-odd samurai have been slaughtered within the castle... There may not be many dead, but they will still serve to terrorize the populace.

My distant ancestor, Saburou, committed a crime, and was cursed by the manifestation of a mountain god. It was so long ago I don't even know what he looks like.

I'm not even descended from his primary bloodline. I've long since changed my family name. I went to a far-off land, and married there.

Even after my human life ended and I became a Heroic Spirit after making a mark on humanity, it still finds me.
