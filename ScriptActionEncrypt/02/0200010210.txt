It seems that Chaldea has sent a Master here to restore humanity, just as we expected.

...you cannot allow that desire to lead you by the nose. You must always be mindful of your surroundings.

Think about it. Why is there no guardian nearby?[sr]Why was the baby crying at set intervals?
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
For that matter, what parent would be so reckless as to bring their baby outside to this Shinjuku?
[k]

These are the sort of questions you need to be asking yourself as you examine your surroundings.

Remember, meaning follows us wherever we go[line 2]not why we live, but why we are where we are.

Meaning in life can be added after the fact, but as of now, there is absolutely meaning in being here.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
You are here to repair the Singularity.[sr]I, most likely, am here to help you.

There are others who are here to stop you as well. You will need to consider these meanings, and make a choice.

[charaFace B 4]

It's the same tactic employed by modern-day snipers. You needn't always kill your target, but rather neutralize the threat they pose.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Shoot their legs or stomach, and keep them alive.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
That's enough on its own, but when their allies then come to help them, you can wound or kill them as well and increase the carnage exponentially.
