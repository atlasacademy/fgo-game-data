These monsters are fairly slow moving, with the exception of the flying beasts. Consequently, they are still quite some distance from Toke.
[k]

＠Danzo
If we hurry, we should be able to reach them before nightfall, even with a detour.

＠Musashi
So we're splitting up from this[sr]group of elite samurai, huh.
[k]

＠Musashi
If they're here to take out those monsters too,[sr]shouldn't they have come with us?
[k]

＠Danzo
Not to worry. They should arrive before us,[sr]as they are meeting the enemy head-on.
[k]

＠Danzo
Once they have engaged the enemy in battle,[sr]we will approach their leader from behind.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Musashi
...Now I see. So he'd already thought that[sr]far ahead when he gave us our orders.
[k]

＠Musashi
Ugh, with skills and smarts like his,[sr]it's no wonder that old man's such a big shot.

Man, I wish I had a cushy government job[sr]with cuties waiting on me hand and foot.

Lord Kotarou, was it? Is something wrong?[sr]Surely I am not the first kunoichi you have ever met.
[k]

＠Danzo
Or perhaps...is it because you have doubts about my name?
[k]

＠Danzo
I can only tell you that I am indeed Katou Danzo.[charaFace A 4][sr]I apologize if I am not what you expect.

But unfortunately, there is[sr]nothing I can do in that regard.

You must know the stories too, right? Katou Danzo[sr]is the most famous ninja from the age of war!

＠Musashi
I don't know much about the ninja world, but even I've heard of the flying Katou and his exploits as master of puppets!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

What about you, [%1]?[sr]Do you know her name?

Wow, really? I guess that's what happens when you experience so much history firsthand!
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

？！

＠Musashi
Still...the age of war was quite some time ago, wasn't it?
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Musashi
I also hadn't heard that you were still working as a spy for Lord Iemitsu. Plus, you seem awfully young...
[k]

？1：If she's been alive this long...
？2：Maybe she's a Servant?

...Yes, I am. I had no idea you knew. I can only presume you must have heard the truth of Katou Danzo somewhere.
[k]

＠Danzo
I hesitated to share this fact myself because it is usually such a difficult thing to explain, but if there is no need to hide it, I would be glad to do so.
[k]

＠Danzo
Yes, I am indeed a puppet, animated by machinery.[sr]I am over one hundred years old.
[k]

？1：So she's a mechanical doll?

[charaTalk C]

[charaFadein C 0.1 1]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
That's right. Think of her as a kind of magecraft. It's certainly rare to see something like her in this time, but she is on par with the magecraft used in the modern day.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I believe there are a few puppet masters that exist in your time as well, aren't there, Master?
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
In fact, there is a long history of mages controlling puppets with magecraft, although it isn't usually called “magecraft” in this era.
[k]

？2：So, she is a homunculus or golem made with magecraft?

＠Fuuma Kotarou
She is indeed. I knew you would understand, Master. It's certainly rare to see something like her in this time, but comparable magecraft exists in the modern day.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
It is basically the same process used to[sr]make homunculi or golems appear human.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
While I am sure the differences would be apparent to an expert, I still know very little about magecraft and sorcery, so I'm afraid that's my best explanation.

＠Musashi
On top of that, this combination turned out to be Katou Danzo, a ninja so famous even I've heard about her.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Musashi
And on top of all that, she's suuuper cute![sr]That's what really matters.

On second thought, my True Name would be confusing.[sr]You can just call me Kotarou.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I am from the Fuu[line 2]I mean, the Sagami Province.

[charaFace A 1]

I see. That's quite a coincidence. Some of my installed ninjutsu are from the Sagami clan as well.

I'm sensing one...two...three... No, there are even more than that. They must have wandered off from their pack; they're clearly not acting as a unit!
