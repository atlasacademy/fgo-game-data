Even in a hell like Shinjuku,[sr]there is a clearly defined hierarchy.

＠
Those with money can hire people[sr]to do violence on their behalf.

The world overflows with money.[sr]And with money, one can achieve ultimate glory.
[k]

＠
One can taste foods never before seen; imbibe liquor never before tasted. All with the power of money.

Forget all about that incompetent, worthless lord you once served.

Achieve glory in his place; become one with it.[sr]Spread money all across Shinjuku.

What would you like us to do with the money we collected?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Assassin of Shinjuku
What else? Use some to buy more food and drink for us.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Assassin of Shinjuku
As for the rest... Let's take over Kabukicho.[sr]Now that Berserker is gone, we can run a store there.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Assassin of Shinjuku
Give them everything they want, and take everything they have.
[k]

＠Subordinate A
I don't believe they had anything of value worth taking.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Assassin of Shinjuku
I'm talking about taking three things:[sr]pride, love, and courage.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Assassin of Shinjuku
Ask them whether they'll crawl on their hands and knees to swear loyalty to us. Entice parents to sell off their kids, and kids to sell off their parents.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Assassin of Shinjuku
Make it so they never even think about the possibility of defying us.
[k]

＠Assassin of Shinjuku
That way, everyone's happy:[sr]me, you, the entire world!
[k]

＠Subordinate A
Yes, sir.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Assassin of Shinjuku
Now let's go out there and grab us some glory!
[k]

＠Subordinate A
You know, there are a lot of beautiful women this time. Perhaps we could keep one or two of them?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Assassin of Shinjuku
Oho, women, hmm? I can't say I care about that sort of thing myself, but let's take a look...
[k]
