This must have been a scouting party. Sakon, tell Lord Matsudaira that he must hurry and deploy archers.

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
The castle's defenses can make do with a bare minimum of soldiers. Concentrate our forces on the southern region and stop any earthbound monsters dead. Do not let even a single rat through your ranks.
[k]

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
Position four-hundred of our men at the front line. Each one has proven his skill in Shimabara; they should be able to hold their own against these monsters.

However, I will say that it is highly unusual[sr]for monsters to band together like this.

That's because they're not just wandering around aimlessly. There's someone leading them. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see them come at us with even greater numbers next time.

Shogunate spies have long been in place throughout Shimousa to verify the rumors of monsters in the area.

That's true. I'm not sure even I could have defeated Purgatorio if I hadn't borrowed this katana.
