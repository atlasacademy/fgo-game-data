Nothing has changed. The ending has already been written. After all, Laputa has already materialized!

＠Scheherazade
Even if the Demon God vanishes, or I die...[sr]It will still plummet to earth! Not a story, but reality!

Parts of it may be damaged, but that doesn't matter.[sr]It should retain its form until impact.

＠Scheherazade
There is nothing anyone can do to stop it! This is the final chapter for all of you...and for me! At last, my wish will come true!
