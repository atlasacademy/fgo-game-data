And so, the Queen of Sheba's procession[sr]fought off the guardian spirits...
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
...and successfully made their way into Jerusalem.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Soon, the king learned that a foreign queen had entered the holy city, and the front gates were finally opened.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Thus did the parade of camels and ostentatiously dressed attendants make their way through Jerusalem.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Though the people of Jerusalem were accustomed to luxury, the riches that the queen presented to the king must surely have made even their eyes pop.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
The lavish spices they brought with them also proved to be incredibly popular, and soon the holy city was filled with their scents.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Shortly thereafter, the queen was officially invited to the palace, and at long last granted an audience with King Solomon himself...

Without fail, the finest jewels and spices brought[sr]to Jerusalem come from the southern kingdoms.

＠Solomon
I have spoken to merchants and travelers[sr]about them, interested to know more.
[k]

＠Solomon
They told me of a queen from a desert kingdom in the south with a sure eye, and a nose for trade.
[k]

＠Solomon
Until last night, my image of that queen[sr]was hazy and blurred, like a mirage...

＠Mash (Narrator)
The two rulers proceeded to walk around Jerusalem's palace, chatting happily all the while.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Every one of the dances performed, the harp songs played, and the dishes served was truly exquisite.
[k]

[charaFace C 7]

＠Mash (Narrator)
But the place that the Queen of Sheba was most impressed with was indeed the very building the good shepherd had told her about.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
The magnificent temple of Jerusalem stood[sr]even taller than the king's own palace.
[k]

[charaFace C 8]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Atop its great altar,[sr]burnt offerings were made to God...
[k]

[charaFace C 7]

＠Mash (Narrator)
There, sacrificial animals and other splendid[sr]offerings were consumed by sacred fire.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Once these offerings were chosen to become God's food, the frankincense, which would later be chosen as one of the three wise men's gifts, was burned like firewood.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Mash (Narrator)
While bearing witness to these amazing spectacles...
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
The queen casually posed King[sr]Solomon a series of questions.
[k]

[charaFace C 8]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Indeed, these very questions were the queen's purpose in venturing to Jerusalem.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
A quest begun in the hope of appraising the king's wisdom, distinguishing his worth...and gaining a true answer to questions she had long pondered.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Some scholars say the queen had only two questions, while others claim she had as many as nineteen.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Whatever their number, King Solomon answered each[sr]in turn, and the queen marveled at his wisdom.
[k]

[charaFace C 7]

＠Mash (Narrator)
And in that moment...
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
...she decided to entrust King Solomon with the three most precious riddles she carried deep in her heart.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Solomon, in turn, honored his noble guest by having his many retainers line up along both sides of his throne.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
So began a battle of wits to test the merits of both rulers. There could be no room for failure. As silence hung in the throne room, the audience watched with bated breath...
