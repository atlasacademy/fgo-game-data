Hah! Should've expected Lord Muramasa'd swoop[sr]in at the last minute and take all the glory!

I'dve liked to be the one to finish the sorcerer off myself, but the important thing is that he's gone.

Now, we'd better get out of here, on the double!

I bet the sorcerer must've known the jig was up and decided to go out with a bang or something.

You know what he looks like.[sr]You know his name.
