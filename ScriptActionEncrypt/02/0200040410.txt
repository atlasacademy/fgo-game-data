...Oh. Good morning, Senpai.
[k]

？1：What are you doing up this early, Mash?
？2：I thought Nezha was keeping watch.
？！

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
I could ask the same of you, Senpai.[sr]It's not even daybreak yet.
[k]

＠Mash
Nezha is staying out of sight and[sr]keeping watch from the roof.

＠Mash
This is the only place they can use their spirit forms, after all.

It looks like today will be the best weather we've seen in a while, even if the wind is still very strong.

Nezha and I both talked to her a bit last night.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
She's been trying to put on a brave face,[sr]but she's suffering quite a lot...
[k]

＠Mash
She feels terrible about what happened to Tituba...
[k]

＠Mash
...and to Lavinia's family.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
And then there's...
[k]

？1：Mr. Carter, right?
？！

＠Mash
Yes... Exactly.
[k]

＠Mash
She said her uncle may be strict, but he was never the kind of person who could do something so cruel...
[k]

＠Mash
...

I guess I haven't been of much[sr]help to you after all, Senpai.

Mash and Carter both vanished.[sr]Of course, I searched everywhere I could, but...
[k]

？1：...You couldn't find them?
？！

[charaFace E 4]

＠Robin Hood
...I'm sorry. This is all my fault. I treated Mash like she was still a Demi-Servant without thinking about it.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
But even if she can protect herself,[sr]she's still just a regular human.

＠Robin Hood
...The forest just gets thicker the more you keep going, so this is as far as we can go.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
It's basically a Bounded Field. Try and get through, and you just end up lost, and after you wander a bit, you're right back in the village.
[k]

？1：Maybe they somehow managed to make it out...?

＠Robin Hood
If so, one of the Chaldea agents around the Mist would spot 'em. Course, that doesn't do us much good, since we still can't contact[line 2]Huh? What is it?
[k]

？2：Actually, now that you mention it...
？！

[charaFace E 5]

[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Robin Hood
Well that's great. Awesome, even.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
...Still, that would've been right around the time I lost sight of them. So if they DID manage to escape...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
...you'd think the Chaldea agents watching the Bounded Field's perimeter would've reported something had changed.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
So why didn't they...?
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

...Oh, right, I almost forgot the other thing.[sr]Over here, Master!

I can make out a gunshot wound on the woman's body, so we can go ahead and rule out natural causes. Either someone killed her, or she took her own life.

[charaFace E 4]

＠Robin Hood
And the man's neck was broken a long time before the crows and ghouls got to him. Which means...

I don't think she even means to be.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Robin Hood
But, given how ravaged these bodies are, I don't think even the Queen Witch herself could tell much about 'em.

？！

Given their location, I'd bet this has something to do with the Bounded Field around the village.

'Cause like I said, they sure didn't die of natural causes.
