Astolfo disrupted the enemy's formation, while I kept Master safe. A surprisingly well-balanced strategy.

[charaFace C 4]
＠d'Eon
...However, we are lacking in destructive power, since Astolfo's Noble Phantasm is all bark and no bite.
[k]

＠d'Eon
We may need someone at the vanguard with more power. Maybe Sanson? ...No, he is a gentleman, and thus best set against people, not beasts.

The Queen and I are the same type of Servants...[sr]Amadeus? [charaFace C 0]No, absolutely not.

Same. First, I'd like to hear more about your surroundings.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Tell us everything you can see and hear.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We ARE analyzing your video feed, of course, but it's helpful for you to give us your impressions as well.

Hmm. So the ceiling is very high up, and appears to be made of stone. The floor is covered in plants, just like aboveground...

Right. Never mind how odd that all is topographically speaking. [%1]'s impression of it doesn't add up either.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's almost like a mosaic. Various features and environs are combined in ways you'd not expect to see in a single landmass.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

It's as if a bunch of authors got together to all write one combined anthology of Agartha.

That's right. However, its signal has become muddled since Master's arrival.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
We're still fairly certain that it's somewhere here in Agartha, but I'm afraid we can't narrow it down more than that right now.

＠Da Vinci
Essentially, our readings on Agartha are oddly blurred and undefined, like in the results of our topographical investigation.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Da Vinci
That's just one example, though. All the data we're collecting about Agartha will sometimes just shift to entirely different values with no continuity.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Da Vinci
And yet, with things in your immediate vicinity, [%1], the continuity appears to be perfectly stable.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In other words, the closer you are to the observation target, the more accurate our results will be.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Da Vinci
Which means we have no choice but to have you continue to investigate on foot.
[k]

？1：You think there are any other people here?
？2：I hope I can find someone to talk to.

？！

[charaFace D 1]
＠Da Vinci
It's hard to be certain with how erratic readings are, as I mentioned, but we're picking up what appear to be artificial structures in the area.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of people nearby.

In that case, we should head for an area where we can get reliable data, and use that as our base of operations while[line 2]
