There are several ways of leading people into a trap. One is to cut off their escape route, making them think their current path is the only way forward.
[k]

＠
Another is to make them think their current path is the way they SHOULD go forward, and stop them from considering other paths as options.
[k]

＠
I wonder which trap [&he:she] will fall for?[sr]Not that it makes any difference now, of course.
[k]

＠
Since [&he's:she's] made the wrong choice right from the beginning.

Very well then, let us go and defeat the Berserker of Shinjuku, so that you may trust me more.

But first, let me tell you everything I know.

＠Archer of Shinjuku
While we do have a better chance of victory now that there are three of us, it's still only a chance.

If we were to attack head-on, we would surely be torn apart.

There are about two hundred Coloraturas stationed in Kabukicho, and another hundred that patrol around Shinjuku on a regular basis.

＠Archer of Shinjuku
And if that weren't enough, the area is a maze of similar-looking buildings, any one of which could contain a number of Coloraturas.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Not to mention that they can see us all clearly from atop the buildings.

[charaFace B 4]

[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
So, has anyone come up with a strategy that doesn't include attacking head-on?
[k]

？1：Sneaking in?

[charaFace B 4]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
I'm afraid that with two hundred puppets to contend with, that would be all but impossible.
[k]

？2：Sniping?

[charaFace B 4]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Even if you obliterated all of Kabukicho, the Coloraturas and the Berserker would survive.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Besides, I'm sure you too have noticed the abnormality that permeates all of Shinjuku.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
While it may not be at Age of Gods levels...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
For Tokyo in 1999, there is an impossible amount of magical energy swirling about.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
That energy has been pouring into concrete buildings, to the point that even they now harbor it.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Thus, I am forced to conclude that your sacred sword can do little to wreak devastation on Kabukicho.
