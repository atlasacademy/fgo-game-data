...Huh, you guys are pretty good at this.[sr]Are you all famous swordsmen or something?
[k]

＠Otama
You took care of those monsters so quickly.[sr]That should give everyone more time to escape.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Otama
Anyway, I'd better be on my way now.[sr]Thanks again for helping us, and take care.

Hehehe, you're not leaving us just yet.[sr]Didn't I tell you we had a favor to ask?

＠Otama
Ugh, what's this about? Is this REALLY[sr]the time to be asking for MORE favors!?
[k]

＠Otama
Besides, it's been an hour since this started.[sr]Most of the survivors have already escaped.
[k]

？1：That's great to hear!

[charaFace D 4]
＠Otama
If there's a silver lining to this mess, that would be it.
[k]

？2：I wonder just how many managed to get out in time.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Otama
Good question, but I'm afraid I don't know.
[k]

？！

[charaFace D 5]
＠Otama
Luckily, Yagyu something or other's samurai kept the monsters distracted long enough for us to get away.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]
＠Musashi
Huh, is that so...? I see...
[k]

＠Musashi
So how come you didn't escape already, Otama?[sr]We're pretty far away from your room here, after all.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Otama
...Well, you know.
[k]

＠Otama
I just happened to notice there were a lot of children and elderly here, so I came to help.

＠Otama
I-it's nothing like that... I just figured we all have to do our part in times of need.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Otama
Oh, right, I just remembered.[sr]Do you know where Lady Kiyohime is?
[k]

？1：No, I don't.
？2：Why do you ask...?

？！

[charaFace D 4]
＠Otama
I heard her servants screaming bloody murder earlier, though I couldn't make out what they were saying.
[k]

＠Otama
Then I saw them running off seeking[sr]refuge at the town's outskirts.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Otama
In fact, I was just about to head that way myself.

＠Senji Muramasa
Thanks again for taking care of my grandkids the other day. Now I'd like to ask you to watch them again. Come here, Onui.

I didn't think there was anywhere I could leave them, but I can tell they'll be safe with you. You seem like you can handle yourself in a fight.

We have to go to the castle and find the mastermind behind all this. It's too dangerous for the kids to come along.

Sorry for the trouble, but I know you'll keep them safe.
