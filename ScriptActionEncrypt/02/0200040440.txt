...God wouldn't want us to talk of people like they're awful criminals just because they're performers.

King David himself loved to dance. He even played his harp to banish the evil spirit plaguing Saul.
[k]

＠Abigail
And all of you like to drink hard cider and cause such commotion to celebrate the autumn harvest.
[k]

＠Abigail
I even know about how you played shuffleboard.

You're wrong. Of course we're going to be happy when God has seen fit to reward our hard work.
[k]

＠B：Villager
But letting entertainment and temptation into our lives also makes us vulnerable to the devil's whispers.

＠B：Villager
Lucifer's beauty was great enough to charm even God Himself!

＠B：Villager
We cannot put too much trust in ourselves. We are frail vessels, so we must always be humble and cautious.

＠B：Villager
We have nothing to our names, yet we still count our blessings as we go about our lives.

＠Military Legal Officer
...Therefore, in compliance with French Army law...
[k]

＠Military Legal Officer
...I hereby accuse spy AF45, aka H-21,[sr]aka Mata Hari of Holland.
[k]

＠Military Legal Officer
She is charged with leaking top secret information to Germany and its allies, and concealing said information.
[k]

＠Military Legal Officer
This included mission-critical information, such as the strategy for the Hindenburg Line, the leakage of which resulted in many casualties for our army.
[k]

＠Military Legal Officer
In fact, we have received reports that our losses number no fewer than fifty thousand soldiers...
[k]

＠Military Legal Officer
Most recently, she has also leaked information pertaining to our transport ship routes, which were subsequently sunken by enemy U-boats.
[k]

＠Military Legal Officer
From her confiscated personal belongings, we have ascertained that the defendant has accepted large sums of money from Germany, so there can be no doubt of her guilt.

The decision is unanimous.
[k]

＠Military Judge
Conspiring against the government and interfering with military operations via espionage are grievous crimes punishable by death.
[k]

＠Military Judge
...I therefore sentence the defendant, Mata Hari,[sr]to be executed by firing squad.

Court is now adjourned!

So you claim that your love of country is a match for the soldiers who gave their lives for France.

Mata Hari, you will face judgment for your crimes once more, in death.

＠G：Military Judge
Look their souls in the eye, and proclaim your innocence!

Listen to their voices, ruined by the bullets that tore through their throats, and hear them yourself...!
