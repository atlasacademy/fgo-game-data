Pity your well-read friend Ms. Kyrielight isn't here to join us, but I suppose there's nothing for it now.

Good question. Let me start from the beginning.

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
Do you remember when we met at the Atlas Institute?[sr]...Yes, it appears you do.
[k]

＠Holmes
Well, there is a reason I continued to Rayshift from London, to Camelot, to Shinjuku.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
You didn't need my help to restore humanity. I suppose I could have offered advice, but so could others.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Holmes
But the same was not true for the incident that would happen afterwards.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
At the Atlas Institute, I was trying to find out if one thing in particular was possible.
[k]

＠Holmes
Whether or not a Singularity could occur after humanity had been completely restored.
[k]

？1：...Huh!?
？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
It turns out that such a thing was very possible indeed.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
Tri-Hermes warned that if humanity were to move from being incinerated to being restored...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Holmes
This distorted history would end up creating enormous remnants.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
Specifically, remnants of numerous powers that could have threatened the entire world, but were wiped out by history playing out correctly.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
To date, the Counter Force, or perhaps something else, has worked to restrain or dispose of these remnants before they could pose a threat, but...
[k]

＠Holmes
When humanity moves towards restoration, their power returns from the cracks of history.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
They're almost like hidden malware that tries to infect your computer when you go to reboot it.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Holmes
Anyway, Tri-Hermes calculated that if a new remnant were to occur, it would be here in 1999 Shinjuku.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
I still don't know why, but...there is one strong possibility.
[k]


？1：What's that?
？！

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 1.0]
[charaFace B 0]

[k]

＠Holmes
No, I'd better not say anything until I know for certain.[sr][bgm BGM_EVENT_7 0.1][charaFace B 1]Now now, don't give me that look!
[k]

＠Holmes
Watson used to give me that exact look.[sr]At any rate, that is why I am here.
[k]

Oh yes, I still have to tell you the most important thing of all.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Holmes
I am not completely confident that I have laid bare all the mysteries Shinjuku hides.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Holmes
Hahaha! Words fail you, I see.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
Indeed, ordinarily I would never divulge a theory that I was still in the middle of formulating.
[k]


＠Holmes
Doing so could cause you all to make errant predictions, potentially leading to grave mistakes.
[k]


[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
However, there is an exception to every rule, and this case is one such exception.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
The reason is simple: his fingerprints are all over it.
[k]


＠Holmes
Threads that should lead to him become tangled and twisted, eventually ensnaring you in a trap.
[k]


＠Holmes
And before you know it, he has you in his grasp, just where he wants you.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Holmes
However, there is only so much one can see by observing a spider's nest from above.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
And if one takes too long to investigate, the wind could blow away the evidence like so much sand.
[k]

＠Holmes
Thus, I have chosen to leap into the spider's web headfirst. Perhaps that's what he wanted all along: for me to take the stage.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
...I imagine if Ms. Kyrielight were here, she would be screaming right about now.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
At any rate![sr]Let me tell you exactly who we are up against.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
My nemesis. A demonic mastermind who disappears without a trace of evidence.
[k]

＠Holmes
He and his subordinates spin threads, each of which leads to the spider lying in wait.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
In order to reach him, I had to evade every one of these threads, sometimes disguising myself entirely.
[k]

＠Holmes
However, I soon learned that even this wasn't enough to find evidence that could convict him.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Holmes
In time, I began referring to him as[sr]“the Napoleon of crime.”
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
But his real name...is James Moriarty.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
He and the Archer of Shinjuku who first bonded with you when you arrived here...
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Holmes
...are one and the same.

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 5]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Holmes
That is why I hesitated to reveal myself.[sr]Moriarty would never side with good and virtue.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
It must be some sort of plot... Regardless, I knew my presence would only endanger you.
[k]


[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
The moment I arrived in Shinjuku, I could sense that he was here.
[k]

＠Holmes
As such, there is little doubt that he is similarly aware of me.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
Given how weak the good Moriarty's Spirit Origin is...
[k]

＠Holmes
I didn't think the same would apply to him. However...
[k]

＠Holmes
It seems that over the course of deducing his True Name, he's managed to sniff out my presence.
[k]

＠Holmes
That being the case, there is no point in my pretending to be the Count of Monte Cristo.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Holmes
And now that I have removed my disguise, the game is well and truly afoot. No longer am I a spectator; I am a participant.
[k]


[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
Which means that it is now only a matter of time before Moriarty and I face each other.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
In truth, I did all I could to remove any mention of him in Watson's writings.
[k]

＠Holmes
In part, that was because, if possible, I wished to fight him on my own.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Holmes
But the other part is that I instructed Watson to write about him as little as was possible.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
In terms of pure strength, there are surely countless Servants who surpass him.
[k]

＠Holmes
No doubt there are also many who exceed him in charisma, especially those from the Age of Gods.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
But when it comes to evil charisma[line 2]devising fiendish plans that are carried out without requiring him to lift a finger[line 2]he is in a class of his own.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Holmes
...Indeed, I feared what effect Moriarty might have on the world. Thus, I asked Watson to depict him as simply and austerely as possible.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
Now, here is the real problem: Moriarty claims to have split into good and bad personas.
[k]

＠Holmes
The bad one took the power and True Name, and expelled the good one from his domain.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
However, as I see it, this just doesn't add up.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
After all...I had sensed almost no traces of good from him.
[k]

＠Holmes
And yet, the Archer of Shinjuku who protected you was sincere in his actions.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Holmes
When he saved you from the fearsome Rider of Shinjuku, he did so with no regard for his own life.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
Nor did it seem like he did so because he had some scheme in mind that would guarantee his survival.
[k]

＠Holmes
Sheer dumb luck was the only reason he survived.[sr]...When I realized that, I was utterly at a loss.
[k]

？1：So Archer is Moriarty...
？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
I thought he might be an impostor, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Which leaves us with a problem.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Holmes
He really is a good Moriarty. It's almost like one of those protagonists suffering from amnesia.
[k]

＠Holmes
This really is a problem!
[k]

＠Holmes
I'd never believed such a person could even exist in this world!
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
Still, while your life may not be in danger, I can't say I approve of the way he let you get abducted.
[k]

？1：He let me what!?

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
Well, you would likely have been abducted at some point anyway. And he knew I would rescue you too.
[k]

？2：Why that little...!

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
You have every right to be angry.[sr]Good or not, that part of him is still very much Moriarty.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Holmes
If he calculates a gambit will be safe, then he will go through with it, no matter how risky it may actually be.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
Now then, I advise you not to try and hide anything from him. Feel free to tell him all about this talk.
[k]

＠Holmes
I know you're concerned, but don't worry.[sr][charaFace B 5]He already knows everything that's happened.
[k]

＠Holmes
He knew you would get kidnapped, meet his other self, and that I would rescue you.
[k]

＠Holmes
He even knew that his True Name would be revealed afterwards, along with the doubts I still harbor.
[k]


[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
Naturally, he's never met me in person.[sr]But he is certain nonetheless.
[k]

＠Holmes
Even if he doesn't know his True Name, he will have sufficient information to deduce it.
[k]


＠Holmes
That is something Moriarty would never fail to do.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Holmes
In that sense, we are very much alike.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
At any rate, once everyone is here, I have something else to tell you.
