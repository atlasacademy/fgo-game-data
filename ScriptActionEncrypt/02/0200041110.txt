＠Mash (Narrator)
H-hello there, everyone.[sr]Thank you all for waiting.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
My name is Mash, and I'll be your narrator this evening. Later I will also appear as an actress in the play.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Today, The [%1] Company will be performing a thrilling fantasy...
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
A beloved tale from the Eastern kingdom of Qing...
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
We will be performing a chapter of a grand epic called “Journey to the West.”
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Our tale begins over a thousand years ago...
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
...when a famed Buddhist named Xuanzang Sanzang sets off westward in search of inspirational sutras.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Sutras, in case you didn't know, are like the Bible for those of the Buddhist faith.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
And while “Journey to the West” may be fictional, Xuanzang Sanzang was a real person.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
A person who crossed a distance equivalent to three round trips between Salem and London.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mash (Narrator)
And with nothing more than the unshakable faith she held in her heart!
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Still, one thing is certain: Xuanzang faced[sr]many trials and perils during her journey.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash (Narrator)
But worry not, distinguished young guests. Xuanzang did not have to undertake this journey alone.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
She was joined by her disciples, who were capable warriors in their own right...
