So, the Berserker of Shinjuku is gone.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
At the risk of sounding a bit clichéd, it seems we've finally reached the beginning of the end.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
I've checked my calculations countless times. They appear correct. Time continues to flow, pooling at a single point.

[charaFace B 1]

The Berserker of Shinjuku is gone.[sr]Or rather, I killed him.

＠Archer of Shinjuku
I know. I also know how you ran away with your tail between your legs.

[charaFace D 0]
＠Emiya Alter

[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Of course. Assassin told you to.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I don't get it.[sr]Why risk the danger of getting close to them?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Assassin may be chivalrous, but he is also very much a Phantom Spirit.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
A man like that who always pretends to be someone he's not will never become a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
So, he cannot resist the temptation to observe heroes up close and personal, in order to determine if they are worth his transforming into them or not.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Emiya Alter
It's too risky. If you ask me, it's like handing your head over to the enemy.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
It is indeed risky. It's also glorious, and arrogant.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
He takes everything from his targets and tramples it, as if to relieve the gloom he felt while alive.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
However, his process is entirely too unclear.[sr]Assassin has decided to kill the Chaldean Master.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
But when? How? Even I don't know.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
With his innate chivalry and doppelgänger nature mixed together...
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Perhaps not even he understands his own thoughts.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
A man like him who could, and would, kill someone he's talking to at any possible moment is a monster.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
He has become an irredeemable psychotic killer.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Emiya Alter
So he's like an evil, sentient time bomb that could go off at any moment, eh.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
He would hate to be interrupted.[sr]Let's wait and see how this plays out.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
I have my own things I must look into.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Emiya Alter
Wow. I'm surprised you haven't already turned over every stone there is.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
There is a new variable to consider: one that steadfastly defies quantification and predictability.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Emiya, why don't you go take a walk around Shinjuku and see how Shakespeare's craft is coming along?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
According to my calculations, the King Lear monster should soon be complete.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Emiya Alter
King Lear, huh. What an interesting choice.
[k]

＠Emiya Alter
I wonder what sort of monster a crazed old man like him will turn into here in Shinjuku.
