I think we can do better than to keep referring to him as “natural disaster” or “big guy.” I say it's time we came up with a proper name for him.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He may have originally been Heracles, but his Spirit Origin has changed dramatically.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
His output, durability, and even divinity are all much higher than usual. The first thing that comes to mind is to call him Giant Heracles...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...but since he once fought against the giants alongside the gods of Olympus, I don't think he'd be particularly thrilled about that.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Da Vinci
How about calling him “Heracles Megalos,” meaning “Huge Hero Heracles”?

Which is to say, they were created by their respective rulers, and don't truly belong to this world.
