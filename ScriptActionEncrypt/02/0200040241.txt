Ahem...

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash (Narrator)
As for what became of the three Jeannes' battle,[sr]that I leave to your imagination.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Suffice to say that during the Hundred Years' War, France was at its weakest...
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
...and England took advantage of[sr]the nobles' infighting to invade.

＠Mash (Narrator)
Although Jeanne d'Arc's appearance succeeded[sr]at turning the tide of that battle...
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
...she ended up being used by her enemies,[sr]and detested by her compatriots.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Even after Jeanne was captured and tried as a witch, King Charles VII did nothing whatsoever to help her.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Despite owing his coronation to her, he likely wished to quell any rumors that might threaten his authority.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Mash (Narrator)
And though she was their enemy, many English people wept to see such a devout figure as Jeanne come to such a tragic end.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Indeed, according to official records, it was an Englishman who responded to her pleas and gave her a handmade cross.
