＠Musashi
...Okay, we should have put a good amount of distance between us and them now.
[k]

＠Musashi
But we definitely can't let our guard down yet. Won't exactly be shocking if they can just blow right through bamboo forests like some kind of freaky wind.
[k]

＠Musashi
Still, I think we can take a quick break.[sr]Enough for [%1] to catch [&his:her] breath.

You were scared too, weren't you, Tasuke...

(Sniff)... Hic, hic...

＠Musashi
...I do too, but we shouldn't get our hopes up.
[k]

＠Musashi
He was up against six highly skilled opponents, each of them exuding a demonic aura beyond anything any normal person should ever possess.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Musashi
It all depends on how far his...uh, Noble Phantasm, was it? How far he can get with that.
[k]

＠Musashi
Lord Inshun's skill with a spear far exceeds that of any normal beast, oni, or person. If he were only up against ordinary swordsmen, he could easily defeat a hundred, or even a thousand of them.
[k]

＠Musashi
...But those people were anything but ordinary. They were like demons...they didn't leave a single opening.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Musashi
Just thinking about them gives me the creeps. Even Lord Inshun would have a hard time defeating them all.
[k]

？1：I'm sure Inshun knows that too.
？2：Hopefully he made it out of there intact.

？！

[charaFace A 12]

＠Musashi
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
[k]

＠Musashi
For now, we should keep running. I don't know if whatever keeps evil spirits out of villages will work on those guys...
[k]

＠Musashi
...but right now, I don't see any other option.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
So if they won't run away from us, we'll just have to run away from them! Like they say, she who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day!

Okay!

[charaFace B 1]

＠Musashi
...What a good girl you are, Onui. You must have been so scared, but you've already stopped crying.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Onui
I'm still scared, but I have to be strong for Tasuke.[sr]I'm his big sister, and he's still just a baby.

Goo goo ga.
