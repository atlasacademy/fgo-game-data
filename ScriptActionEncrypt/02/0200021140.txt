That is all well and good, but what about the Amazons that escaped? Won't they raise an alarm?

They might've already done that after catching sight of us from the shore. There's no point worrying about that sort of thing now.

We just have to get to El Dorado before anyone brings word of our attack!

Then it'll be that much easier to take out their base.
[k]

＠Rider
Based on our recon, El Dorado's where the Amazons are keeping most of their men. What's more, they're all strong and healthy men, just the way they like.
[k]

＠Rider
Once we free them, they'll join our side and stop the enemy from multiplying. Two birds, one stone.
[k]

＠Rider
We'll also be able to load up on supplies, which will make our next move that much easier.

So right now, we keep moving full speed ahead!

No surprise there. The Amazons probably built a few of them to ward off the Ys pirates.

But I bet they didn't count on guys like us charging in at full steam! Now: RAMMING SPEED!
