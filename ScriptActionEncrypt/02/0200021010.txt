Well this is a surprise, leading off by infiltrating the enemy's home base.
[k]

＠Rider
It's so out of left field I'm still wrapping my head around it. I just hope our new tactician here didn't betray us the first chance she got.

I need all of you to win in order to ensure my own survival.

＠Scheherazade
I simply determined that this course of action was the best one we could take at this point.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
I admit that it is not without risk...but it would be far riskier NOT to take it.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
If we don't make a move now, the Resistance will be cornered without any means of retaliation.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

That means I would die.[sr]And I...don't want to die.

Scheherazade's decision lines up with Chaldea's strategic analysis as well.
[k]

＠Mash
Ys has been wiped out, and the Nightless City is now occupied by the Amazons of El Dorado.
[k]

＠Mash
The balance between the three main powers has completely collapsed, and El Dorado now controls almost all of Agartha.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Mash
And without any opposition, their forces will only continue to grow the longer we wait.

With all us Servants around, we shouldn't lose when it comes to small-scale battles, but I'm afraid we're hopelessly outmatched in sheer numbers.

Indeed...which is why our only option is to strike first.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Now that the Amazons are occupying the Nightless City, their forces must be split.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Thus, I believe that El Dorado's defenses are currently at their weakest.

If the Berserker is there, we can defeat her before backup arrives.

If she isn't, we can occupy El Dorado before she returns and reduce the Amazons' numbers.

It's a truly bold and daring strategy, where speed is of the essence.

At first I thought you were a quiet and reserved woman, akin to the moon on a dark night, but I see now that your passion for the battlefield burns as brightly as the scorching sun.

＠Fergus
I'm very impressed.
