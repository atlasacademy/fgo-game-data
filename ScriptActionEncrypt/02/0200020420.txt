There are three major cities here, each of which is in the center of its respective region.

Each city is ruled by a different Servant, and are at constant war with one another.

They are Servants who may have ended up there themselves.

Returning to the matter at hand: there are three powers vying for control over this place.

Four, I suppose, if you count those of us in the Resistance.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Rider
Incidentally, the borders between each Servant's territory are not quite clear. That is not counting those of us living in the space between territories...
[k]

...The various powers fight each other daily in an endless cycle of gaining and losing ground.
[k]

？1：So then, that queen we met earlier...?

？2：Tell us more about these Servants.

[charaFace F 0]

We were fortunate to just miss her, but it seems you had the ill luck to run into her yourselves. It's a wonder you lived to tell the tale, really.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]

＠Rider
She is the queen of the Amazons, the ruler of the golden city in the jungle, which is one of the three major cities of Agartha.
[k]

＠Rider
We call her the Berserker of El Dorado, after the Amazons' capital city.
[k]

＠Rider
She and her people are the most aggressive of all the major powers down here...
[k]

＠Rider
...and also the most numerous.
