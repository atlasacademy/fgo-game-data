Indeed. I could not have understood before my rebirth, but now, I understand very well.

＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
You are exactly right.[sr]That is why I broke the taboo, and drew my blade.

[charaFace E 1]
＠Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami
No matter how I may try to remain calm and unattached, my body cries out to battle you, right here and now.

I have to face this old man, right here and now.

Even if the world is ending, and there is no end of people crying, suffering, and dying...

＠Musashi
This duel to the death still comes first for me. When you live your life swinging a big knife and cutting down other people, your pride comes before anything else.

Ahahaha. And here I thought I'd proven a little more[sr]trustworthy by now. [wt 0.2]...No, you're right. He's strong. Exceptionally strong.[charaFace A 12]

＠Musashi
Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami's swordsmanship has reached a godlike level. He's seen things I don't even understand.
[k]

＠Musashi
I almost certainly can't beat him on my own, especially since I've only just gotten used to fighting with one eye. If I tried, I'd be dead in an instant.

I really can't put anything past you, can I,[sr][%1].
