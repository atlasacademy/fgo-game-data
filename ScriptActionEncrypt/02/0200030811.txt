＠Kiyohime
Oh, come to think of it, Lady Swordfighter...earlier,[sr]I heard you addressed as Musashi...
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Did you...perhaps name yourself after[sr]the famous swordmaster, Miyamoto Musashi?
[k]

[charaFace D 3]

＠Musashi
Uh... G-good question. Ahahaha.[sr]I don't really remember where my name comes from.

[charaFace C 1]

＠Kiyohime
You MUST be as strong as the real Musashi![sr]In fact, I'm sure of it! That's amazing!

＠Kiyohime
May I ask what sort of training you[sr]underwent in order to become so strong?
[k]

[charaFace D 8]

＠Musashi
W-well, uh, I don't think my regimen will be of much help to anyone besides me, but...
[k]

＠Musashi
Basically, I travel around visiting different countries looking for opportunities to train, I guess? Huh, when I put it like that, it actually sounds kind of normal.
[k]

[charaFace C 7]

＠Kiyohime
So you travel to distant lands,[sr]training wherever you go!?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
I can't believe you travel around like that by yourself...[sr]I'd love to hear more about it!
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Oh, but first, we should have supper.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Kiyohime
Then we can take a bath and throw pillows at each other, then you can tell me all about your exploits! It'll be a wonderful sleepover!
[k]

＠Musashi
Wait, huh? We're going to throw pillows at each other?
