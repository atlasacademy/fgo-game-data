I was sure I felt this katana cut through something...sever it, as smoothly as if it had cut the shadow of the moon reflected in a pool of water.
[k]

＠
It was not a heart, nor a soul. It was something nebulous, yet still essential for the world of humans.
[k]

＠
...It was fate.[sr]This katana cut through something like fate itself.
[k]

＠
...Still, I didn't want to defeat him.[sr]I didn't want to fight him.
[k]

＠
This was neither the place, nor the manner,[sr]in which I wanted to duel Houzouin Inshun.
[k]

＠
I had fallen in love with his Soujutsu at first sight. It was but a fleeting moment, but I still saw the purest representation of a warrior's spirit within it; enough to nearly bring me to tears.
[k]

＠
Lord Inshun's Soujutsu was the culmination of endless refinement. It was the technique of one who sought and reached a different destination than I.
[k]

＠
Ordinarily, I would have no hope of defeating him.[sr]But, that Soujutsu was already gone.
[k]

＠
His beautiful form had been covered up beyond all hope of recognition. As such, I now had any number of ways with which to claim victory.
[k]

＠
...What a tragedy.
[k]

＠
No monstrous strength, no immortal body could ever surpass the pristine beauty of that spear.

I attempted to pierce you with my spear's essence,[sr]but it seems you too wield free-flowing techniques.
[k]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
Or perhaps... Had you already come up with a strategy to defeat me, after we had crossed blades but once?
[k]

＠Lancer of Purgatorio
Did you already have a plan for how to evade my Soujutsu? For how you could kill me?

It's true, in my mind's eye I faced you in a no-holds-barred duel over and over, and thought about what I could do to defeat you.

Out of the thirty-two duels I imagined,[sr]I died in thirty-one of them.

You were strong, without a doubt. But I could still see a way to win. All I had to do was choose it.

The will of the heavens. The laws of this world.[sr][%1]'s help.

What a weird feeling. Also, someone in one of the worlds I visited said that sleeping during the day and being awake at night was terrible for your skin!

If you don't mind, I'm hoping you can lend us a place to sleep so we can get some rest. But first, I really need to stuff my belly.

I needed to thank you for bringing Onui and Tasuke back anyway. If you're happy with a katana no one else can use, that sure makes things easy on me.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

Huh? You're really giving this to me?

＠Masculine Youth
Ears, open.[sr]Don't make me repeat myself.
[k]

[charaFace C 9]

＠Masculine Youth
Like I said earlier, that thing's a failure. An evil[sr]blade that ended up reaching the demonic realm.
[k]

＠Masculine Youth
The ultimate blade I seek isn't[sr]one that cuts flesh and bone.
[k]

＠Masculine Youth
Any sharp, metal thing can do that.[sr]An axe or knife works just as well as a sword.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Masculine Youth
A person who dedicates their life to the forge[sr]shouldn't be satisfied with something like that.
[k]

＠Masculine Youth
The sort of katana I seek is one that can terminate enmity... One that severs bonds, certainty, karma.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]

＠Masculine Youth
After all, if I couldn't make a katana like that, what right would I have to call myself a swordsmith?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Musashi
A sword that severs bonds, certainty, and karma... Now I see. That's what freed Lord Inshun from his karma.
[k]

＠Musashi
Now that I think of it, he and those shadowy people even said something to that effect.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Musashi
Well then, it's no coincidence this sword helped me defeat him.
[k]

＠Musashi
You may think it's a failure, but it succeeded at cutting the karma of someone who had been taken by the Curse of Annihilation, or whatever they called it.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

＠Musashi
I mean, I definitely couldn't have beaten him[sr]all on my own! It was thanks to this sword!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Masculine Youth
Huh. So victory was all thanks to that katana, you say?[sr]Then maybe you get it.
[k]

＠Masculine Youth
Never you mind what I said earlier. Not only will I feed you, I'll give you a place to sleep.
[k]

＠Masculine Youth
Go get some shut-eye once you've eaten up.[sr]You too, kid.
[k]

？1：Thank you!
？2：(This guy's a lot nicer than he lets on.)

？！

[charaFace C 7]

＠Masculine Youth
That said, doesn't change that the sword's a failure.[sr]You can't cut bonds or certainty with a katana alone.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Musashi
Well, this one still seemed to work for karma.[sr]Don't you think?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Masculine Youth
I suppose it did.[sr]Guess it just goes to show how good its wielder was.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Musashi
Damn straight.[sr]So, does this katana have a name?
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Masculine Youth
...Tch. If I had to choose one,[sr]I'd call it Myoujingiri Muramasa.
[k]

？1：Myoujingiri...
？2：Muramasa?

？！

[charaFace C 0]

＠Masculine Youth
“Myoujingiri” means it can cut things that[sr]are beyond human. Means it's a god cutter!
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Musashi
Muramasa...
[k]

＠Masculine Youth
Yeah?
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Musashi
Muramasa?
[k]

＠Masculine Youth
Yeah. What?
[k]

＠Musashi
Then, you wouldn't happen to be...
[k]

[charaFace C 3]

＠Masculine Youth
...Tch.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Masculine Youth
That's right. Name's Senji Muramasa, a Saber.[sr]A Servant, just like that monk from earlier.
