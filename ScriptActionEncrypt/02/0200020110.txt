Hmm... A whole new world... I think it deserves a better name than just “underground space.”
[k]

＠Da Vinci
From now on, I'm going to call it “Agartha.”

[charaFace A 1]

Of course, this is Helena we're talking about. She may have Rayshifted there on her own after hearing about the place, or she may have been resummoned there automatically for a completely different reason.

After all, she is the heretic[charaFace A 4][line 2]I mean, hero of the occult world, with ties to UFOs and everything.

But...I'd bet there's some kind of connection to this, even if we can't tell what it might be yet. Anyway, we can worry about that later.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Da Vinci
Right now, all we can say for sure is that Helena, and maybe a few other Servants, might be there.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If you can track them down, I think you should try to rendezvous with them. They should be willing to cooperate, since you already know them and all.

I agree. And if Helena really is there, we may be able to learn something useful from her, since she knows so much about mythical underground worlds.

That would be a great help in keeping Master safe.[sr]So if she's there, I hope you find her soon!
