With but a single command, it would draw in his opponent's weapons and render them harmless.

Wukong, meanwhile, searched everywhere for help, an endeavor that eventually brought him face-to-face with the great Jade Emperor.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Mash (Narrator)
The emperor, in all his wisdom, instructed Wukong to seek aid from two renowned generals, the greatest martial artists in all the Heavenly Realm.

＠Mash (Narrator)
So Wukong paid a visit to the general standing guard over the Heavenly Realm's southern gate...

The legendary Fire Lord, renowned throughout the entire southern region!

＠Mash (Narrator)
Every one of the divine soldiers' swords, spears, and arrows was wreathed in red-hot flame!
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
What's more, they brought to the field a host of Divine Beasts: fire dragons, flaming horses, flaming crows, and even flaming rats...!
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Unable to endure this assault, the Single Horned Rhinoceros King and his subordinate enchantress ran hither and thither in an attempt to escape!

Unfortunately, the massive stream of water failed to make its way into the cave where the Single Horned Rhinoceros King lay in wait...

Instead, it succeeded only in flooding the mountain's nearby hills and fields.
