...Hah! This feels right![sr]So incredibly right!
[k]

＠Rider
The feeling of plotting a course from the bow as the ship sways back and forth! The chilling splash of the water, the creaks and groans of the hull...
[k]

＠Rider
I still can't remember anything, but damn if this doesn't feel like coming home to an old friend!

No. I mean...why are you wearing that outfit?

Weeell, it's a sailor outfit, right? I just happened to hang on to it, so I thought it'd be perfect for a voyage like this!
[k]

＠Astolfo
You gotta set the tone with stuff like this, y'know? Besides, I wanna get everyone all fired up!
[k]

＠Astolfo
And it's working like a charm! Don'tcha think?

[charaFace D 11]

True... The Resistance does seem to be looking at you like you're some sort of sea goddess.

In fact, Master may be looking at you a little TOO much... Um, at any rate, please watch your skirt.

There is only one advantage that the Resistance holds over El Dorado.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
The fact that you were the ones to topple Ys.
[k]

The city itself may now be flooded, but there is still something you have gained from it...

Correct. Every river here in Agartha flows back to the great eastern lake where Ys once stood.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
The pirates[line 2]Dahut's underlings[line 2]would sail ships upstream along these rivers to attack and plunder at a moment's notice.

No... While I was serving Dahut, I had a number of chances to ride their ships myself.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
They were enchanted with some form of magecraft that propelled them forward just by unfurling their sails, whether they had wind or not.

＠Scheherazade
As I said before, Rider, one of the keys to this plan is the fact that we now know you can sail.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
It has nothing to do with your Riding, and everything to do with your knowledge of commanding a ship, which is in its own way, a kind of living thing.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Scheherazade
And...unfortunately, it is only possible now that the Resistance is small enough to fit aboard one ship.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Granted, it might be more accurate to say that they no longer have any choice but to do so, as their home has been burned down.

I agree. With our current numbers, there won't be much point in leaving anyone behind. If we're going to attack, we should all do so together.

All of this means that, with things as they are now, we can use a single Ys ship, and a river that leads into the heart of the jungle...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
...to launch an attack on the enemy's base in El Dorado with the entire remaining Resistance.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
This will be a surgical strike, concentrating all of our power on the enemy's most vulnerable point. I believe that is our only chance at victory.

Now don't go worrying about that. You can't move forward if you keep turning around to look behind.

Besides...remember what we're about to ride.

Ships only move in one direction, and it isn't backwards.
