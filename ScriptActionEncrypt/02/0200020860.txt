You're quite good. More's the pity, really.[sr]Why do you not understand?
[k]

＠Assassin
There is nothing wrong with my system of reporting. As long as people can hold themselves to a high standard, they CAN conduct themselves properly!
[k]

＠Assassin
Of course, they must put in the effort to do so. Namely, the effort to uphold my laws, to suppress their base desires.
[k]

＠Assassin
I understand that by virtue of being human, one will inevitably have desires.
[k]

＠Assassin
The desire to sleep when one wants, to eat what one wants, to be lazy, to even commit crimes...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Assassin
But it is only the suppression of those desires that will allow for a true and just nation to be born.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Assassin
In that sense, those fools in Ys were the polar opposite, since they explicitly sought out the pleasures that come from pure indulgence.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]
＠Assassin
And thus, their destruction was assured![sr]But not me. Not the Nightless City.
[k]

＠Assassin
Though some may remain here who cannot control their desires, they will be weeded out in due time.
[k]

＠Assassin
If one can apply oneself in a focused, dedicated manner, one is certain to walk a moral and just path! Why can you not understand that!?

So far as we can tell, this nation is a den of torture and cruelty. I wonder if it only seems like justice to you because of how above it all you hold yourself.

In essence, the moment I made my decision was also the moment in which I acquired the treasure I had been seeking my entire life.

Sorry for my absence. I've been focusing on analyzing the data, and I've finally got an answer.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]
＠Da Vinci
Granted, she's been giving us plenty of hints from the beginning, but her childish appearance didn't quite line up with everything.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Da Vinci
But now that you've fought her directly, we have much more accurate data to work with, and I'm certain of my conclusion beyond any doubt.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Encouraging citizens to spy and report on one another... Employing brutes known as Torturers to go around hurting people and drag out undesired truths...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And this “Yaoguang Hall,” the heart of the Nightless City...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
While it may not have been quite as flashy as this incarnation, this Servant is still reported to have lived in a building of the same name.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...In other words, all of these are things she used while she was still alive.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
＠Da Vinci
She's known as an empress here, right?[sr]That's not because she's the ruler of this city.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Da Vinci
It's because she really was an empress.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
What's more, she was the only empress in all of history to ever rule over China.

She began her rise as a concubine to Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty, and later married his son, Gaozong, following Taizong's death.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She assassinated her rivals, steadily gained power, and eventually claimed the entire country as her own.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She commanded her subjects to address her as “Dowager,” “Empress Dowager,” and later “Empress Regnant”...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If we believe her most popular name to be her True Name, we have two to choose from:

Zetian Wu Hou or Wu Zetian!
