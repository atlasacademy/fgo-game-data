Based on previous observations, the Berserker of El Dorado seems concerned with expanding her territory.

But we have also seen her behave in a manner counter to that simple explanation.

...Wherever Megalos appears, she rushes in to battle him.

She does so regardless of where she currently is, or what her current situation may be...as though there is nothing that matters to her more.

＠Da Vinci
I can only surmise that she's mistaken him for Achilles.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If so, it's no great shock. Look at her.[sr]She's as berserk as Berserkers come.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The mere fact that they are both Greek heroes[line 2]his scent alone[line 2]is enough to get her to mistake him for the object of her hatred.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That is how much she hates Achilles. Even a vaguely similar scent is enough to drive her utterly berserk.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Indeed, her raging hatred of Achilles is the very foundation of her existence as a Heroic Spirit.
[k]

？1：Wait... You figured out her True Name?
？！

[charaFace G 0]
＠Da Vinci
Yup. Actually, this was one of the possibilities I considered at the start. But her actions recently made me certain of who she is.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
After that war cry, I'd say it's safe to assume she was queen of the Amazons in life.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Her true name is...
[k]

？1：Penthesilea.

[charaFace G 1]
＠Da Vinci
Nailed it.[sr]I see you know your history, [%1].
[k]

？2：Hippolyta?

[charaFace G 4]
＠Da Vinci
Close, but no cigar. That's the name of her older sister. This is another of the Amazons' queens.
[k]

？！

[charaFace G 0]
＠Da Vinci
That's right...[sr]Her name is Penthesilea.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The queen of the Amazons, known far and wide for her strength and beauty.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She came to Troy's aid in the Trojan War after Hektor was killed and the Achaeans seemed about to win. Later, she died in a duel against Achilles.
