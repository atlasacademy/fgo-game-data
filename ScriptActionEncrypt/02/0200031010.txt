I'm glad it's such a nice day out for our trip back.[sr]If it was raining, my kimono would get all filthy!
[k]

＠Musashi
I paid good money for this outfit, so I want[sr]it to look nice for as long as possible!
[k]

？1：Right on.

[charaFace A 6]
＠Musashi
I may only be able to make a living with my katana thanks to my lousy old man, but I still like to look good.
[k]

＠Musashi
In fact, I had a skilled tailor custom-make[sr]both this obi and kimono just for me!
[k]

？2：I didn't think you cared about that sort of thing.

[charaFace A 7]
＠Musashi
Of course I do. I enjoy looking good, you know. Though I do forget all about it when it comes time to fight a duel!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Musashi
I may run around doing whatever I feel like now, but back where I grew up...I was lucky to know lots of good people.
[k]

＠Musashi
Both this obi and kimono are proof of that. Hell, I wouldn't even have had the money for my swords without help from the various people I've met.
[k]

...Anyway, at the rate we're going, we should be back[sr]at Grandpa Muramasa's hermitage in an hour or so.

Still, old man Tajima said he has a plan in place, and that we'd only get in the way if we stuck around.

At any rate, Lord Kotarou, may I ask you a question?[sr]...[charaFace C 4]Are you sure you are uninjured?
[k]

＠Danzo
During your battle, Lord Tajima-no-Kami ordered me to leave the princess and go outside the castle...
[k]

＠Danzo
But you stayed behind and fought the[sr]villain to keep the princess safe.
[k]

＠Danzo
Not only that, you suffered a terrible injury when you shielded that young [&man:woman] from a surprise attack.
[k]

＠Danzo
And yet...you are still so sprightly...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
O-oh, now I see.[sr]So you found that strange, huh?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Danzo
Since you are a ninja, at first I thought[sr]it may be due to some sort of ninjutsu.
[k]

＠Danzo
I recall you telling me you were[sr]a Sagami ninja before, after all.
[k]

＠Danzo
But I searched my database, and was unable to find any ninjutsu that would explain your rapid recovery...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
I-I see. Thank you for your concern,[sr]but I'm quite all right.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
My body is quite different from an ordinary person's,[sr]but it is not because of any ninjutsu.
[k]

＠Danzo
But, I know you are not a machine like I am.
[k]

＠Danzo
While I have not had the sensation myself, I am aware that living creatures experience pain when they are wounded.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Danzo
I am unable to feel such things as humans do, but I have also heard that pain can be unbearable to them.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
Well, uh... There are certainly some wounds that can't be healed, but don't worry; mine weren't like that.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
What's more, I'm still the head of a ninja clan, even[sr]if I may not look like it. Pain is nothing new to me.

A great army, ten-thousand strong, with cavalry,[sr]foot soldiers, archers, and gunners, was gathering.

＠
It was an army of the shogunate, assembled quickly and in secret under the orders of Tajima-no-Kami, with the sole purpose of wiping out every monster in Shimousa.

＠
Each troop was led by proud, experienced warriors[sr]from the Shimabara Rebellion and the Siege of Osaka.

This army might well have been the last one ever[sr]assembled whose soldiers remembered the age of war.

Whether they faced monsters, the Toyotomi, or Christians, they were keen blade created expressly to cut down any force threatening the society the Tokugawa created.

They were just about to leave this field in order to rendezvous with their commander, Yagyu Tajima-no-Kami.

I've never heard anything so pathetic. It's unbearable. The Seiwa Genji would be rolling in their graves if they could hear you so-called warriors now.
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
All your insignificant buzzing, not a word to be heard. You're no better than insects.
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
Insects are such disgusting creatures.[sr]Best to squash them. Quickly.
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
Since I'm already here, I may as well take the opportunity to exterminate this horrid infestation.

...It was, in every sense of the word, a bloodbath.
[k]

＠
This was no battle.[sr]It was wholesale slaughter.
[k]

＠
Fully armored cavalry, foot soldiers, archers, gunners... Each and every one was mowed down indiscriminately.
[k]

＠
Under the blood-soaked light of the crimson moon,[sr]all ten thousand men were sacrificed for Onriedo.
[k]

＠
Let's be more precise. In total, there were ten-thousand two-hundred and forty-five soldiers gathered there on the east bank of the Arakawa River that night.
[k]

＠
No less than ten-thousand two-hundred and forty-four of them were cut down. The sole survivor was a young foot soldier.
[k]

＠
He was a youthful hatamoto who had never once been on a battlefield. After listening to his older compatriots share their tales of battle, he volunteered for the Shimousa army of his own accord.
[k]

＠
Sadly, the bright and eager expression he had worn on his face merely half an hour earlier was now gone.
[k]

＠
The light was gone from his eyes, and all he could do now was stare up at the cloudy night sky, mumbling as saliva dribbled down his chin and tears rolled down his cheeks.

A fool like that would make a poor sacrifice. I refuse to wet my blade when there is nothing to be gained from it.

＠Berserker of Saṃghāta Hell
Anyway, nice job tonight, Kālasūtra Hell. As for me, I went ahead and lapped up every bit of suffering, regret, and hate I could find.
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
What a little sneak... If I weren't a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, you would have been the first I killed.
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
How terribly irritating.
[k]

＠Berserker of Saṃghāta Hell
Ahaha, sorry about that. By the way, Kālasūtra Hell,[sr]I don't suppose you'd like to try something out?
[k]

＠Berserker of Saṃghāta Hell
You see, my Noble Phantasm's all filled up now.[sr]In fact, it's a little too full.
[k]

＠Berserker of Saṃghāta Hell
I'd like to go ahead and pour it all out...but if I did that, it might end up melting a whole province or two. What do you think?
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
That is what you wish to do? Commit a pointless atrocity when Onriedo is nearly upon us?
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
...Oh, very well.
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
In that case, why don't we venture over to the neighboring province of Sagami? I've always wanted to see the Ashigara region for myself.
[k]

＠Berserker of Saṃghāta Hell
Sagami, eh. What about Edo then?[sr]Shall I eat everyone there while I'm at it?
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
Oh yes, Edo. A city where people from all walks of life come together.
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
It reminds me of an anthill more than anything.[sr]In my time, the eastern lands were never so populated.
[k]

＠Berserker of Saṃghāta Hell
So? What do you say?
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
...I say no. The Lord Sorcerer has his own[sr]sights set on Edo. We should leave it alone.
[k]

＠Berserker of Saṃghāta Hell
Then Sagami it is.
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
Agreed. Let us dye its ocean bloodred. I do have some attachment to the Kamakura shogunate, but Sagami was the home of the loathesome Houjou clan.
[k]

＠Berserker of Saṃghāta Hell
I thought the Houjou didn't matter anymore[sr]in this period. Well, whatever.
[k]

＠Berserker of Saṃghāta Hell
Danzo. I know you're about.[sr]Tell the others we're going to Sagami for a spell.
