(I can feel it tingling with a divine aura![sr]I knew it. This sword is on a whole other level!)

＠Masculine Youth
Wait. Stop! Trust me, leave that one alone![sr]It's one of my worst failures!
[k]

＠Masculine Youth
It'll cut through stone, armor, even diamond effortlessly. But you can't use it on people!
[k]

＠Masculine Youth
I admit, in some ways it's some of my best work![sr]But it's too terrible to use on any decent folk!

I fear I went overboard,[sr]and pushed it into the realm of demons!

Hah! It matters not what manner of weapon you may have procured. No blade exists that can slay the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters.

Care to find out for yourself, Musashi?

My body will regenerate from any wound, as many times as it needs! Will you still attempt to cut it down with your Niten Ichiryu!?

Of course.[charaFace A 5][sr]Truth be told...I've been waiting for this.
[k]

＠Musashi
I do usually try to avoid fighting when there's nothing in it for me, but only when it comes to fighting for fun. If there's some real purpose behind the fight, well, that's another matter.
[k]

＠Musashi
Why do I train? Why do I wield a blade?[sr]Why do I slice, or sever, or at times stop in my tracks?
[k]

＠Musashi
It's all to reach the apex of mastery.[sr]I could never hope to reach the void alone.
[k]

＠Musashi
That's why I wanted to fight you. A no-holds-barred battle between two experienced swordsmen is a treasure that outshines even gold.
[k]

＠Musashi
I shall gain more knowledge from this duel than I would from a thousand meditations, or ten thousand battles.
[k]

＠Musashi
...My only regret is that my opponent is no longer human. That the great Houzouin, with his incredible divine aura, has fallen to darkness!
[k]

＠Musashi
You may still be a foe I could not hope to surpass,[sr]but that is also where the key to my victory lies!
