Technically it's still descended from the god of Ooe, but you cut through it like it was nothing! Sooo scary!!!

Ahahahaha! I can't remember the last time I had this much fun!

No more games. It is almost noon, and so we will fulfill our end of the deal and face you in battle.

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
It is time for your execution... No, wait, this isn't an execution, is it.
[k]

＠Rider of Kālasūtra Hell
I suppose the Lord Sorcerer has his reasons. At any rate, justice is not a concern of ours. That will make this more of a slaughter, a mass murder, indeed, a massacre.
