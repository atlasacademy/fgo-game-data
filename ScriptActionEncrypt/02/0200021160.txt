Even before his Berserker enhancement,[sr]his power as a Heroic Spirit was incredible...

...but when we consider the sheer magnitude of strength added to his usual with this giant form...

...Indeed. On top of all that, Megalos seems to be in an endlessly rampaging state, and shows no signs of slowing down at all.
[k]

＠Mash
In essence, he appears to have gone ultra-berserk.[sr]That would explain why he's acting like a monster.

It's actually kind of impressive, in a scary, monstrous sort of way.

You've done a fair amount of damage to him, but he's still incredibly dangerous. Keep your guard up.

His roar is like a thunderclap, shaking the entire ship. His arms are like the wind, raging tirelessly to break the mast.

He throws wave after wave at us. He stands dark and unyielding, blocking our way as far as we can see...

So stay out of my way! The New World I've been dreaming of is finally within my reach!

I'm putting my anchor down right here. I will show this storm that I'm already at my destination!

This marks the first step to the end of my long voyage!

“Santa María Drop Anchor”?[sr]I knew it. So that's who he is...

？！

[charaFace F 0]
＠Da Vinci
Sure have. I think you'll recognize the name, too.[sr]La Santa María was the ship he's most famous for...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He sailed it across the Atlantic Ocean, and “discovered” the New World[line 2]at least as far as Europe was concerned[line 2]in the 15th century.

Be careful, everyone! Just because he's tied up doesn't mean he's not still a threat!
