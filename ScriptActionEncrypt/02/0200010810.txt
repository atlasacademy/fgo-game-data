I am an evil person. There is no doubt about that much.

Of course. You were ready to kill.[sr]That's all I needed to know.

If you're prepared to fight evil with evil, it doesn't matter whether you're the one to press the button or not.

？！

[charaFace C 0]

What's important is that you have an iron will. The resolve to cross the line and kill. The determination to do what must be done to achieve your goal.
