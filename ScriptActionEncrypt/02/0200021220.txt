She's alive!?

Oooh, yeah. No body, no death! We only saw her get swept up in Ys! She must've gotten swept down here just like us!

＠Dahut
Drifted here? No, I always knew about this place.[sr]This is another paradise of mine.
[k]

＠Dahut
It is my last bastion, something I kept on hand in case Ys was ever destroyed.
[k]

＠Dahut
I was planning to rest here while my injuries healed and my magical energy was replenished.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Dahut
But then you came along![sr]What are YOU all doing here!?
[k]

＠Dahut
I've been waiting for what feels like an eternity. I wanted to take something so badly, but there was nothing here to take!
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠Dahut
Yes, that's right.
[k]

＠Dahut
I didn't lord over the dull Nightless City, where its subjects suppress their desires. Nor did I command the Amazons of El Dorado, a tribe so barbaric they wouldn't get self-denial if it jumped up and bit them.
[k]

＠Dahut
I was the beautiful ruler of Ys. I brought my people happiness by insisting that none deny herself!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Dahut
So why... Why did I end up like this?

You mean to take from me? No! That won't be happening. I'm the one who will be doing the taking.

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 2.0]
＠Dahut
I will deny myself no longer! In fact, doing so would be wrong! That, I believe, is the key to happiness!

[charaFace A 11]
＠Dahut
...So I will take your freedom. Your dignity.[sr]Your vitality. Your hope.

Man. Woman. I don't care.[sr]I just want to take someone to bed.

[charaFace A 5]
＠Dahut
I have no need of pride or ambition.[sr]Nor do I need hope or purpose.
