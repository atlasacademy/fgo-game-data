＠Kiyohime
Oh my, so you really have been to countries outside of Japan!? That must have been a terribly difficult journey.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Being in a strange land, where you can neither speak nor read the language? And all by yourself, no less!?
[k]

＠Kiyohime
I can't imagine being in a place like that all by myself, with almost nothing familiar nearby...
[k]

＠Kiyohime
The thought terrifies me... But, for some reason,[sr]it also sounds kind of wonderful... [charaFace A 12]
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Kiyohime
I could never do something like that...[sr]But, part of me would love to try!
[k]

＠Musashi
You'd be surprised how well you can get by, even with a language barrier. Some people will help you learn to speak, and you can also get pretty far with gestures.
[k]

＠Musashi
People are basically the same no matter where you go,[sr]and scary things are scary no matter where you are.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Musashi
So I'd say the scary stuff and fun stuff balance each other out.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Musashi
Sure, there are times when I'm suddenly overcome with an urge to go back home...
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Musashi
But on the whole, it's a lot of[sr]fun to meet so many new people.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Kiyohime

＠Kiyohime
The only unusual thing that has ever happened to me is rescuing a baby snake out in the castle garden.
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Ever since then, I've gotten along well with snakes.[sr]I can even tell what they're thinking.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Musashi
So you have a telepathic bond with them![sr]That's awesome!
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Musashi
But you know, princess, Shimousa is pretty diverse. There's all sorts of people to meet right outside the castle doors.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Musashi
You met that snake here, after all, and you met[sr][%1], Kotarou, and me here too.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Kiyohime
Oh, that's a good point. Hehe, you've got me there.[sr]Come to think of it, Lady Musashi...[charaFace A 0]
[k]

＠Kiyohime
Did you know [&Lord:Lady] [%1][sr]before you met [&him:her] here?
[k]

＠Musashi
Yeah, I first met [&him:her] on an island not too long ago.[charaFace B 11][sr]That was a pretty rough time.
[k]

＠Musashi
At first, my memories were so fuzzy that I didn't even know who I was or where I was from.
[k]

[charaFace A 14]

＠Kiyohime
Oh my, that sounds dreadful![sr]What sort of island was it!?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Musashi
Well, it was a small island,[sr]but it had a surprisingly steep mountain...

The Lord Sorcerer will wield the power of Lucifer, the great Satan himself, against Shimousa, using it as a sacrifice to bring about the end of the world of men!
