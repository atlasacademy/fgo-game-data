I do not mind dying. I do not even mind losing. It means nothing more than that I was not strong enough to claim victory.
[k]

＠Penthesilea
But if you too had risked your life in our battle...that is not what you say of your opponent.
[k]

＠Penthesilea
If you had truly fought desperately, you would have been relieved to be alive. Flushed with the thrill of victory... Elated with the joy of piercing a powerful foe with your spear...!
[k]

＠Penthesilea
At the very least, that is what I would have felt in your place. But you...you were different, Achilles!
[k]

＠Penthesilea
That you thought to say such a thing to my face[line 2]the one that moments ago might have been the very face of your doom...
[k]

＠Penthesilea
...That rather than relief at your survival, or elation with your victory, such nonsense was the first thought to cross your mind...
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Penthesilea
...means you never even saw me as a warrior! The very opponent you had been fighting mere moments before!
[k]

＠Penthesilea
Rrrggghhh! You will pay...[sr]You will pay for that humiliation with your life!
[k]

＠Penthesilea
I even took the form of my younger self so that, even should I lose, you would never think to speak such drivel to me again!

Like Achilles, you Greek heroes are our sworn enemy.

＠Penthesilea
Heracles. You stole my older sister Hippolyta's girdle, threw our nation into chaos, and killed her. I shall kill you one day as well.
[k]

＠Penthesilea
Then there is Theseus, who abducted my younger sister and made her his wife. You cowards... I swear, I shall kill you all one day!

No it won't. Did you think I would drop my guard just because our battle was over?

I would never do that. Young though I may be, I'd never betray the trust they placed in me.

On the subject of trust, I should mention:[sr]I mistrusted you from the very start!

Well I'll be damned. I never detected a hint of suspicion from you, but you went and deflected that shot like it was nothing.

Pity. If I could have blown Master's head off there, this would have all been wrapped up nice and neat.

What a shame. And here I thought we were all in the same boat together.

That said, nobody there suspected anything until I told them about you.
