Hey there, [%1]. Looks like you came ready for anything, just like I told you!

It's a sad fact of life that people can get used to almost anything, after all.

Without a bit of affirmation here and there, one could even become accustomed to my own marvelous beauty... Hard as that may be to imagine.

...Well, Senpai, to get straight to the point...
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 7]
＠Mash
We've discovered what appears to be another Singularity involving one of the surviving Demon God Pillars, like in Shinjuku...
[k]

？1：A Demon God Pillar!

[bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]
[charaFace B 7]
＠Mash
That's right. As you know, the 72 Pillars are Demon Gods with fearsome power that combine to make up Solomon...or rather, Magical Protocol Goetia.
[k]

＠Mash
We believe this to be one of the pillars that escaped from the Temple of Time.
[k]

？2：...!
？！

[bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]
[charaFace B 7]
＠Mash
We've checked it against the data we acquired from Shinjuku, and are all but certain.
[k]

[charaFace B 12]
＠Mash
However...
[k]

？1：What is it?
？！

[charaTalk A]

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Da Vinci
I don't blame Mash for not wanting to say this.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You may have Rayshifted to all manner of places and Singularities...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Da Vinci
But this one is highly unusual, even compared to your previous endeavors.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
At first, even we couldn't believe that a Singularity would appear there, of all places.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But we double and triple-checked our calculations, and we're sure of our results.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We have to assume it's really there and act accordingly, even if it doesn't seem to make any sense.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Of course, it goes without saying that there's no telling what could happen there, or what sort of dangers may be waiting.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Da Vinci
But that's what Rayshifts are for: to go to times and places that don't even begin to qualify as ordinary.
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 4]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Mash
...Right. Chaldea's Order applies even if[line 2]no, precisely because these situations are so unusual.
[k]

＠Mash
And of course, it makes sense that the Chaldea Master with the most knowledge and experience would be the one we send to look into and resolve the matter.
[k]

[charaFace B 8]
＠Mash
Which means...
[k]

？1：Another Singularity for me, hm?

？！

[charaFadeout B 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 3]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Da Vinci
You got it. The fact of the matter is, we don't have any other viable Rayshift candidates.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I know we're asking a lot of you, taking on another long-term investigation so soon after Shinjuku, but we really don't have another option.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Da Vinci
That said, I wouldn't blame you for refusing this time around. But it looks like I don't need to worry about that, do I?
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 4]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Mash
Right. In our current situation, when there's no one that can take on the responsibility of Rayshifting.
[k]

＠Mash
Master [%1] is more determined than anyone to take [&his:her] turn at bat.
[k]

[charaFace B 8]
＠Mash
...I just wish I could fight alongside you again, Senpai.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 1.0]

？1：I feel better knowing you're here supporting me.

[charaFace B 3]
＠Mash
...
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_4 0.1]

？2：You will, as soon as you're back to your old self.

Thank you, Senpai.[sr]I'll do my best to make that happen soon.
[k]

？！

[charaFace B 13]
＠Mash
In the meantime, I'll be sure to keep observing you here.
[k]

＠Mash
I'll use every piece of information at my disposal to eliminate danger before it reaches you.
[k]

＠Mash
In that sense, all of Chaldea's observational equipment will be my shield.
[k]

[charaFadeout B 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 2]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Da Vinci
Well said. In battles like these, that kind of support is absolutely crucial.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
People out in the field tend to overlook them, but logistical support and reconnaissance are critical aspects of success on a battlefield.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Da Vinci
Besides, you have other capable Servants. It may be dangerous, but you'll have everything you need to succeed on your mission.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Da Vinci
All right then, since we can't keep referring to these as Pseudo-Singularities, I think it's time to give this Order a proper name.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Da Vinci
We are up against stray remnants that broke free from the 72 Demon God Pillars during our battle at the Temple of Time.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
These remnants developed consciousnesses of their own, deserted Goetia, and scattered themselves around the world of their own volition.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Our mission is to retrieve these dregs that should never have existed in the first place.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So, given all of that, we will call the operation to eliminate the Pseudo-Singularities “Remnant Order.”
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In essence, it'll be a cleanup operation of the Grand Order's collateral damage. [charaFace A 0]Not that that means it'll be easier than the other Singularities.
[k]

？1：Got it! So, where am I going now?
？！

[charaFace A 5]
＠Da Vinci
Listen up! We have determined the time period and location of this Singularity.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It is in central Asia sometime in the 2000s.[sr]It's very close to our own time, much like Shinjuku.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
To date, there are no records of noteworthy wars or other major incidents taking place here. The strange part, though, is the Singularity's coordinates.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Da Vinci
It turns out that this one is located deep beneath the surface of the earth.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
What we're dealing with is a mysterious underground hollow large enough to house an entire country that appeared seemingly out of nowhere in central Asia.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Da Vinci
That is your next destination!
