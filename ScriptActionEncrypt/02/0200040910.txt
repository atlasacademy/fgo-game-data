On one of my missions...

＠Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman
...I needed to fall into a deep, very lengthy sleep, to catch a horror that threatened the world itself.
[k]

＠Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman
Let us say only that the most relevant words pertaining to it were “ocean” and “cephalopod.”
[k]

＠Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman
But unfortunately, while I was sleeping, my body was stolen from me.
[k]

？1：By Räum, the Demon God Pillar?
？！

＠Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman
That's right.
[k]

＠Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman
Much as it pains me to admit, I'm afraid I possess a temperament that makes me, ah, easy to possess.
[k]

＠Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman
What's more, Salem was home to my ancestors, so I have a deep connection to it.
[k]

＠Cosmic-Traveling Gentleman
No doubt Räum wanted to ensure there was no one around who could easily infiltrate this land.
