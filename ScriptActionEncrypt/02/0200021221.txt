I finally get this fog outta my head, but now everything's all weird...

And what's with these clothes?[sr]Definitely not my kinda style. Haha...

？！

[charaFace A 8]
＠Dahut?
Huh? I feel like you and I have met before somewhere... Ah well, it doesn't matter.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]
＠Dahut?
I knew what I was getting into when I decided to be a pirate. If we lose a fight, we lose our treasure. That's just how it works.
[k]

＠Dahut?
I'd rather it was a treasure map that makes you jump through all sorts of hoops to find the booty...but it looks like I don't get a say in that.
[k]

＠Dahut?
Ugh, guess I'm out of the grand adventure game for the time being... Here. It ain't much, but why don'tcha take this box with you.

You oughta be able to find some more in that castle over there. Since you managed to beat me, you get to use 'em how you see fit.

Weeell, I guess you WERE all about the whole take, take, take thing, and didn't much care about what you'd already took, took, took!
[k]

＠Astolfo
So I guess it kinda makes sense you'd just give it all away!

If I hadn't lost, I'd be blowing it all on booze and drinking every last drop[line 2][charaShake A 0.01 2 5 0.4](Cough, hack) ...

It's all right... I was watching Dahut use it, and I don't think opening it will cause any sudden aging.

In fact, I believe this Tamatebako may just be exactly what we need...
