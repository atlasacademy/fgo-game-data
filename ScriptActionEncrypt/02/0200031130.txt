Good, we finally made it to the trail.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Senji Muramasa
From here, we could reach the peak in an hour if we hurry without stopping, but then we would be too tired to fight, so we won't be doing that.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
So we hurry, but we also take breaks when we need to. No pushing ourselves too hard, and no getting exhausted.
[k]

？1：I can push myself a little bit.
？2：We need to get there as soon as possible.

？！

[charaFace D 8]
＠Senji Muramasa
As they say, even heaps of dust make a mountain in time. We need to hurry, but push yourself too much, and all of a sudden, you can go no further.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Senji Muramasa
And if that ends up taking you out of commission just when it really counts, you'd never be able to forgive yourself.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
So if you start to get so tired that you feel it in your knees, take a break. We still have a long way ahead of us.

It was a terrible time to be alive back then. For most people, it took everything they had just to stay alive.
[k]

[charaFace D 7]
＠Senji Muramasa
All the samurai cared about was conquering other provinces, so there was no end of war on this tiny island.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
Every now and then we'd get a great leader, but they'd always die well before their time, and there was no guarantee that their successor would worth a damn.

And if a powerful province came and invaded us,[sr]our feudal lords inevitably proved all but useless.

In order to fight a war, you need money, food, and manpower. It wasn't enough that our lords would demand we hand over our money. They also demanded our lives.

[charaFace D 7]
＠Senji Muramasa
Working the rice fields was hard enough, but they came[sr]in and drafted all the young farmers for the army...
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
...then all of the fields were neglected. In the worst case, those farmers would even get killed in battle.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Senji Muramasa
On top of that, whenever a battle broke out near a village, soldiers would invade it and take everything from food to women.
[k]

For most people in times of war...life is hell.

Nor did I ever see any god or Buddha feeding[sr]starving children after a war came to an end.

I can see it in your eyes.[sr]You've been through a lot, but...
[k]

You grew up in privilege.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
Yours are the eyes of someone who's never gone hungry, or lived in fear of war, or had to sleep out in the cold.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
And you don't come from nobility either, do you?
[k]

？1：I'm just an ordinary [&guy:girl].

It may not be a straight line from Iemitsu's[sr]reign to your time, but eventually...

Now I know this land will be home to kids with gentle eyes like yours. Even if people like you seem strange to me.

Truth be told, it's hard for me to imagine a time filled with oddballs like you, but if this so-called peaceful world gets us there eventually, I guess it's not all bad.

Thinking back on it now...I devoted every day[sr]of my life to forging swords, and nothing else.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
Where blades are concerned, as long as you make them as you were taught, they can cut through most anything.
[k]

[charaFace D 8]
＠Senji Muramasa
But that just wasn't enough for me.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Senji Muramasa
A sword forged by a true master should,[sr]I thought, be able to cut through anything.
[k]

[charaFace D 7]
＠Senji Muramasa
I was born and raised to make swords and nothing else.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
Even as everyone else around me starved to death,[sr]my work as a smith kept putting food on my table.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Senji Muramasa
That's why I thought my swords had to be able to cut anything, or else there'd be no point to my life.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
So I set out to make the ultimate sword.[sr]I ended up forging so many blades...
[k]

[charaFace D 7]
＠Senji Muramasa
But only because if I didn't, I'd never be[sr]able to make one that was truly peerless.
