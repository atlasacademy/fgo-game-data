Yeah, that scared the hell out of me! Not to mention the shock of sensing their evil ki! Where do they get off popping up in our bedroom like that right after we put out the lights!?

＠Musashi
Who do they think they are, the bat monster I fought in Himeji Castle!? Princess, get behind me!

I'm going to make these shameless creatures wish they'd never surprised me and interrupted our sleepover!

The battle is over.[sr]We've defeated all the hostiles!

？1：You fought well, Kotarou!

[charaFace C 1]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Think nothing of it. Those creatures were no match for me. I'm the one who's grateful for your assistance, Master.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Thanks to you, we completely dominated the enemy despite their greater numbers. Now then...
[k]

？2：Hey, you kind of sounded like Mash there!

[charaFace C 1]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Oh, I suppose I did. I guess that's because I'm now in the same position of keeping you safe, just like she used to!
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I must have unwittingly modeled myself after her![sr]Now then...
[k]

？！

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I have a question for you, Assassin of Paraíso.[sr]Do you harbor a Curse of Annihilation as well?
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Are you certain you aren't going against your own[line 2]your original Heroic Spirit's wishes by acting like this?

＠Assassin of Paraíso
What sort of question is that?[sr]Who do you think we Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Assassin of Paraíso
We are the shadows of figures who have made their mark on humanity. We are neither ghosts, nor evil spirits, nor vengeful specters.
[k]

＠Assassin of Paraíso
And of course, we are not Heroic Spirits.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]

＠Assassin of Paraíso
We Heroic Spirit Swordmasters carry blades created to slash this world to pieces. Storms of power given form.
[k]

＠Assassin of Paraíso
We kill men. We kill women. We kill the old and the young. Not even infants escape our grasp... That is what Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are.
[k]

＠Assassin of Paraíso
We skewer with spears, burn with fire, and twist off heads. Our means of cleansing this world are endless.

My soul? What a strange question.

[charaFace D 3]

＠Assassin of Paraíso
Soul... My soul, hmm?[sr]What a sentimental Heroic Spirit you are.
[k]

＠Assassin of Paraíso
What about your Holy Grail War rituals, where many of you Heroic Spirits come together to kill one another?
[k]

＠Assassin of Paraíso
Would you rattle on with the same nonsense during one of those? How does your soul feel when you kill other Heroic Spirits to grant your lord's wish?
[k]

It seems that sincerity can devolve into obstinacy, or even madness, if left unchecked. It pains me to see what an immature whelp you are.

Thank you, Master![sr]I'm counting on your help!
[k]

？2：I'm proud of you for trying to talk to her!

[charaFace C 1]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I was actually just copying you, Master! Besides, many other Heroic Spirits have done the same thing!
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Not to mention that I was obligated to say something, given my position!
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
...At any rate, it seems there is nothing left to do now but fight!
