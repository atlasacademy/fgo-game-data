Given those women's fighting style, clothing, equipment, and determination to fight to the last...

They must be Amazons.

...That was incredible. You completely dominated your opponents through sheer skill rather than brute force.

Winning like that takes a lot of patience. I'm especially impressed that you were able to do so against female warriors.

Personally, I couldn't contain my surprise at seeing women fight with such ferocity.

Well, I have heard that there are lots of strong female warriors in the area surrounding Ulster.

But I've never even met one, let alone fought one.

Now then, we may not have been able to get any information out of the Amazons themselves, but we do know more after investigating this camp.
[k]

＠d'Eon
For one thing, it appears that this was a hunting outpost.
[k]

＠d'Eon
And those beasts we encountered on the plain earlier must have been running away from them.

Ohh, now I see. I guess they must've been hunting them for food?

Definitely, yes. We have yet to see anything like a farm so far, so they must primarily hunt for food.

Furthermore, it seems they have been taking their game somewhere else after making the kill.

You can tell from the wagon tracks heading away, down that road. And where do you think that road leads?

？1：Another town, I guess.

Indeed. But even if it isn't a town, it is still very likely that we find another populated area.

Yeah, I don't see much point in just going on a nature walk. Heading where there are people will be a better way to get answers.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We need more information on this world, and on the Demon God Pillar. What's more...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...if there are other Servants like Fergus here who disappeared from Chaldea, we might be able to get information on them too.

I agree. It's good to have Astolfo taking the initiative, but I'm also glad that someone as cautious as you is there too, d'Eon.
[k]

＠Mash
Anyway, please be careful, Senpai. We still don't know why the Amazons attacked you without warning.
[k]

＠Mash
Likewise, we don't know if you'll find other kinds of people up ahead, or simply more Amazons.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
After all, we still know almost nothing about Agartha.
[k]

？1：Got it. I'll be careful.
？2：Don't worry, I'll keep my guard up.
