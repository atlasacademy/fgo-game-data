And done. You know, that might have been a nice warmup for what's to come.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Rider, since we're approaching our destination, why don't you tell us about the sort of enemies we'll be facing in the Nightless City.

The women of the Nightless City are very reserved, unlike the Amazons and pirates.
[k]

＠Rider
They don't go around hastily attacking the other regions too much. They tend to focus on defending their own land.

Really? But their leader got pretty extreme at Ys.[sr]WAY extreme!

＠Rider
Indeed. Which is almost certainly why Dahut never saw it coming. I certainly wouldn't have.
[k]

＠Rider
For the Nightless City's ruler to infiltrate enemy territory all on her own, and take out the entire city with a single strike to its one weakness...
[k]

＠Rider
She is the very model of an Assassin in that respect.

It's also possible that she intentionally refrained from drawing attention to herself up till now in order for that plan to work.

True. But now that Ys is gone, there might be changes taking place across the entire Nightless City.
[k]

＠Rider
We should start with some careful reconnaissance.

＠Mash
Since we found Drake at Ys, albeit in a somewhat different form than usual, like Fergus...
[k]

＠Mash
...at first I thought we might find one of our other missing Servants in the Nightless City.
[k]

＠Mash
But now, I'm fairly certain that whoever its ruler is, she didn't come from Chaldea.
[k]

？1：Dahut did say something about a Caster though.
？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
That's true. She did mention that when speaking to the Assassin.
[k]

＠Mash
So it would seem safe to assume that the Nightless City is home to a Caster Servant as well.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
In which case, there's still a chance that it could be Helena...

Regardless, our task remains the same.[sr]We'll never find out unless we go there ourselves.

Come to think of it, Rider...
[k]

＠Fergus
Do you have any idea as to how many soldiers there are in this city? It would be nice to know what sort of enemy we're up against ahead of time.

I'm afraid not. As I said, they've mostly kept to themselves so far.

＠Fergus
I see. I ask because I still cannot make myself draw my sword against a woman.
[k]

＠Fergus
So I was hoping there might be some other sort of opposition there that would let even someone like myself be useful.
[k]

＠Fergus
I'm afraid that even after seeing firsthand in Ys what terrible enemies women can be, I still can't bring myself to do battle with them.

Hang on, I just remembered something. The Resistance once took in a man who escaped from there.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]
＠Rider
He was in such a terrible state we weren't able to get much from him, but the one thing we did learn...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Rider
...is that the Nightless City is home to those...

...Dogs.
[k]

＠Rider
He told us that the city is full of dogs. Though of course, I don't know if he meant real dogs, or something else altogether...
