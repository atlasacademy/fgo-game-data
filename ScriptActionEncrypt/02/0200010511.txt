Due to extenuating circumstances, I'm currently on Servant leave.

＠Jeanne Alter
Is that so? Kinda wish you weren't, seeing as you're our last bastion of defense and all.

Ah well, I guess we'll figure something out.

＠Mash
Th-thank you for understanding.

[charaFace A 13]
＠Mash
I'm honestly a bit taken aback.[sr]I didn't know you thought so highly of me.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
I remember you refusing to let go of your shield even though you had to fight back tears of fright.
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
Seeing as we detestable holy maidens don't get scared at all, I figure you'd make a better human.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
Ugh, what a waste.

＠Jeanne Alter
I'm sure we wouldn't have lost if you'd been on our side.

I'm told that the Servant possessing Mash is Galahad.

That makes her one of my knights.[sr]I won't have you trying to poach her.

[charaFace E 1]
＠Jeanne Alter
Hey! Who knew the ice bitch queen even had emotions left anymore?
[k]

＠Jeanne Alter
But unfortunately for you, she's NOT Galahad, so I can do what I damn well please, ice bitch queen!

HAH! First your Shielder dumps you, now your Master! Whatcha gonna do, ice bitch queen?

Me? Get along with her?
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

Yeah. For once I have to agree with her, Master. What are you, stupid? Did you mean that as a joke? Because I'm not laughing.
