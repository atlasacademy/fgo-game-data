You ARE a strong woman. You may have had the Demon God Pillar's help, but you still planned, constructed, and created this story.

＠Fergus
More than that, you never gave us the slightest hint that it was you, even though we were right by your side. You are nothing if not resilient.
[k]

＠Fergus
And not just you.[sr]Every woman we met here in Agartha was strong.
[k]

＠Fergus
Dahut. Wu Zetian. Penthesilea. The pirates of Ys, the subjects of the Nightless City, the Amazons of[sr]El Dorado...
[k]

＠Fergus
They were all strong, in their own ways. Thanks to that,[sr]I see now just how narrow-minded I used to be.

[charaFace A 4]

＠Fergus
That version of me met, saw, spoke to, and did battle with strong women. I can even remember some names, though only faintly.
[k]

＠Fergus
Medb of Connacht. Scáthach, the queen of the Land of Shadows. Aífe, ferocious as a wild dog.
[k]

＠Fergus
Deirdre, who fiercely fought her awful fate.[sr]Ness, who offered up her body so her child could be king.
[k]

＠Fergus
No doubt I met these women after I was fully-formed.
[k]

＠Fergus
But even before I met them, there must have been other, similarly strong women as well.

That's exactly what I'm talking about. In the same way that I came to realize how strong women are...
[k]

＠Fergus
...the time I spent here in Agartha merely let me experience things I would eventually learn anyway.
[k]

＠Fergus
Some women loved to plunder, some were bound by social norms, and some simply obeyed their leader.
[k]

＠Fergus
What's more, every one of them lived happily in their own way. They all had strong points and shortcomings.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]
＠Fergus
I'm a simple man at heart, so I wanted to resolve that complexity. I wanted to know if it was possible to lead a nation in a way that everyone could accept.
[k]

＠Fergus
As I said before, I'm greedy.[sr]I couldn't stand the idea of everyone not being happy.
[k]

＠Fergus
So as I learned more about Agartha, I kept thinking, and thinking, and thinking...

Columbus's desire was to get rich by selling slaves. There was no reason those slaves had to be women.
[k]

＠Fergus
As far as he was concerned, the fact that Agartha was full of women was simply icing on the cake.
[k]

＠Fergus
He would have been perfectly happy, and acted the same even if it had been dominated by men.
[k]

＠Fergus
If you had made this world in line with his desire, it could have just as easily been a world ruled by oppressive kings rather than queens.
