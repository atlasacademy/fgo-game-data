I'm calling with information for you.[sr]How you use it...IF you use it is up to you.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
I just saw some soldiers from the League of Phantom Fiends on the move. They were led by a Servant named Emiya.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
They are headed for the altered Jeanne d'Arc's hideout.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
She has remained neutral since she was summoned.[sr]She neither helps the weak, nor bows to the strong.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
She simply sticks to her territory and roasts any who dare to trespass.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
However, these soldiers are heavily armed. The only logical conclusion is that they are planning to kill her before she can join you.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
That said, this Jeanne is a dragon witch I once made an enemy of. I can't guarantee she is trustworthy.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Do you plan to go and help her anyway?
[k]

？1：Of course!

＠Edmond Dantès

＠Edmond Dantès
Heh, calm yourself, [%1]. Though I am glad to hear you answer just as I thought you would.

You'll find her in the Shinjuku National Garden.[sr]And you may want to hurry.
