After you fell into a coma, something intervened in the dream you were having and brought your consciousness somewhere else.

We already had data on hand from the time you fell asleep like this for seven days, so we surmised what had happened fairly quickly.

But even though we knew what was happening, nothing we tried could reach you.

Pardon. My apologies for the intrusion.

I'm quite impressed that you've managed to restore both Fuuma Kotarou's magical energy and your own magical circuits, Master.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Holmes
I had deduced that the trouble with our communications most likely lay with you.
[k]

＠Holmes
To begin, your mind was able to attain something similar to a physical body after being transported in a manner not unlike a Rayshift.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Holmes
However, that body is very much a temporary construct.[sr]Your real one is still asleep here in Chaldea.
[k]

＠Holmes
Therefore, as long as your new body was able to adjust to that world, there shouldn't have been any issue...but had it not, it is entirely possible that your magical circuits wouldn't function properly.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Holmes
After all, the comms device you always use is as much a kind of Mystic Code as it is a machine.
[k]

＠Holmes
Which means, if the magical circuits within your body were unable to acquire energy, your comms device would fail to function as well.
[k]

？1：Come to think of it...
？2：When I first got here, I couldn't summon anyone.

？！

[charaFace D 5]

As I suspected.[sr]Then either you adjusted to this world at some point...

...or perhaps, someone helped you to adjust through some special means?

I described Ms. Musashi as a mobile Singularity precisely because of the many connotations such a term implies.

Despite her unusual nature, she alone would not cause this sort of inter-dream phenomenon to occur.

Say there were multiple mobile Singularities in the same world. Such a phenomenon would certainly be unprecedented.

True, that does line up with everything we've seen[sr]so far. Even before Onriedo Castle showed up...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
...monsters began appearing throughout Shimousa at the same time that the sorcerer and the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters were first seen.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

Furthermore, the Swordmasters always had monsters accompanying them...
[k]

...and many more appeared in the castle[sr]town right when Onriedo Castle showed up.

In my original hypothesis, I surmised that Ms. Musashi should be able to control these monsters in the same way.

＠Holmes
But that does not appear to be the case. Therefore, I expect the difference is most likely a matter of output.

This sorcerer most likely has a stronger mobile Singularity temperament than Ms. Musashi.
