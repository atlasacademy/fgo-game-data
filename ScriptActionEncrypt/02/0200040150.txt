＠Mash (Narrator)
Thanks to their capable bodyguards, the queen's procession easily fended off their attackers.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Soon after resuming their journey to Jerusalem,[sr]the procession arrived at the Red Sea harbor.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Mash (Narrator)
The harbor was packed with throngs of camels, and there was a lively din sounding left and right from merchants awaiting ships and cargo.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
The queen's caravan rented hundreds of ships,[sr]then set sail for the north of the Red Sea.

＠Mash (Narrator)
...In time, the massive fleet arrived upon the northern edge of the Gulf of Aqaba, at a seaport called Ezion-Geber, built by King Solomon himself.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Mash (Narrator)
The people of Israel were surely taken aback by the appearance of this mysterious queen and the untold wealth she brought with her.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
This magnificent scene of the queen meeting King Solomon has been depicted in countless numbers of painted masterpieces.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Mash (Narrator)
The queen's procession headed northward over land, their eyes taking in the pastures of the foreign country that surrounded them.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Then, at last, they arrived at a point where they could just barely make out Jerusalem's glittering white ramparts.

＠Mash (Narrator)
And yet...something seemed amiss...
