Phew, this place doesn't get any less weird the more we see of it! We're waaay underground, but we still got forests and big, open grassy fields!

Nooot that I'm complaining! This is much better than pitch-black darkness! Or lava!

Yes. The ceiling is carpeted in luminescent moss, and its glow changes according to the time, so we have a twenty-four hour day just like the surface.

While I'm asking questions, here's another one:
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Da Vinci
I know we're heading towards a camp that you built to help facilitate the attack on the water city...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...but why did the Resistance choose this city for its first point of attack to begin with?

[charaTalk F]

＠Rider
That gets back to topography.
[k]

＠Rider
Agartha has a number of rivers, and each one flows into the great eastern lake where the water city is.
[k]

＠Rider
Simply put, you can sail upriver from that lake and get pretty much anywhere you want to go.
[k]

[charaFace F 6]
＠Rider
And that is exactly what the people of Ys are doing: using those rivers as a means of travel with which to attack their enemies and plunder supplies.
[k]

＠Rider
If we don't do something about them, there's no telling when or where they'll strike next. And so they're our highest-priority target.

So, if we can capture Ys and take their boats for ourselves, we'll be the ones in control of the rivers.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Fergus
That makes sense. No wonder you chose this for your first point of attack.
[k]

＠Rider
Right. If we pull this off, it'll give us a significant advantage in the rest of our campaign.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Rider
The other three powers might have us hopelessly outnumbered, but that doesn't mean we give up.
[k]

＠Rider
Giving up is never the answer. That's why we keep moving forward, even if only a little bit at a time.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Rider
...All right, we should reach the camp soon.
