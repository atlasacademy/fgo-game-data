Hmm. All right, Scheherazade, for the moment, I'll admit that you make a good tactician.

I looove getting new allies!

Still, I just had a thought, and I realized something...

[charaFace B 0]
＠Astolfo
Our ultimate goal here is to find the Demon God Pillar hiding in Agartha and take it out, right?
[k]

＠Astolfo
I mean, if we wanna do something about this weird sorta-Singularity place and save everyone down here.

...That's exactly right. Our Order is to defeat the Demon God Pillar and destroy all of Agartha.
[k]

＠Mash
Even if we somehow managed to dig a tunnel and let all the men here return to the surface...
[k]

＠Mash
...there will continue to be new victims until we manage to resolve the underlying cause.

Yup! I get all that.
[k]

＠Astolfo
And at first I kinda figured that the Demon God Pillar we had to kill was the Berserker of El Dorado.
[k]

＠Astolfo
But then I thought: What if it's actually Megalos?

Speaking as a Celtic man, I would like nothing more.

For us, the stronger our opponent is, the better.

＠Fergus
There would be no honor in defeating a weakened Greek hero, but now that he is so incredibly powerful, defeating him would bring us unimaginable honor!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Fergus
...Though of course, I'm afraid I'm almost certainly not yet strong enough to actually do that.

＠Rider
If this Demon God Pillar is the one that made this place...
[k]

＠Rider
...then naturally, this place would follow the rules that its creator laid down.
[k]

＠Rider
And the rules of this world are obvious. Men fall from the surface, and women use them as slaves and to create more women.
[k]

＠Rider
In other words, Agartha is a world made for women.
[k]

＠Rider
In which case, the Demon God Pillar must be one of the people trying to rule this world.
[k]

＠Rider
There used to be three possible candidates, but now...there's only one.

Dahut. Wu Zetian.[sr]And the Berserker of El Dorado...
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Their dispositions do seem very different from those of us who don't wish to be here.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Which then begs the question of whether that is their true disposition, or the Demon God's influence.

Oh, hey! So, since we've run into Lil' Fergus,[sr]Captain Not-Drake, and Mega Herc...
[k]

Does that mean that every Servant who disappeared from Chaldea ended up here after all?

Nor can I... It could be that we simply have yet to encounter them...

...or it could be that they have already been killed by either Dahut, Wu Zetian, or the Berserker.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Scheherazade
...What an awful thought.[sr]I really don't want to be killed.

The mere thought of dying compels me to practice begging for my life.

Either way, there's no sense worrying about someone we don't even know is here.

＠Rider
And since we can't count on Megalos for anything, the only ones we CAN count on are the ones who are here.
[k]

＠Rider
All right, tactician, this is your time to shine.[sr]How do we go about fighting El Dorado?

Tell us what you've got in mind.
