Most of them are farmers, fishers, and hunters, but there's also blacksmiths and cloth dyers. Not to mention the Reverend.

They're all industrious colonists who wake up[sr]with the sun and spend their days hard at work.

I understand how frustrating it must be to have a young girl under your charge running off at night.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
You must have been worried sick about Abby to have come so deep into the woods searching for her.

＠Mata Hari
That said...I know that wild beasts sometimes go after livestock, but I thought that they usually stayed away from people these days.

...That's true, but it's not just beasts we need to worry about. The nearby forest is very dangerous.

Some even say that this land is cursed.[sr]That God Himself has forsaken our village.

You are no longer to talk about your hometown, no matter how much the other girls beg you. Is that clear?

Yes, Mr. Carter. I promise I won't do it again...[sr]I'm so sorry about this.
