Let's get a move on. We can't have the nice geisha looking after Onui and Tasuke forever.

Oh, is that how it is?

[charaFace A 8]
＠Musashi
Hey, Grandpa, you really took a liking to Otama,[sr]didn't you? Is she your type or something?
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Senji Muramasa
Nothing to do with type, girl. What's not to love about a woman of principle? Or are you still too young to understand that?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Musashi
Wait...are you saying I'm NOT a woman of principle?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Senji Muramasa
In your case, I don't think I'd call it principle.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Senji Muramasa
If anything, I'd say you're more like...a giant flower, perhaps?
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
Otama's a flower too, but in your case, there's no stem. You're just all flower.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]
＠Musashi
What's that supposed to mean!?
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Senji Muramasa
Don't worry, it's a good thing. You're the kind of flower that stands out just by being there.
[k]

[charaFace A 3]
＠Musashi
Wow, so you're saying I'm a flower blooming in a sea of grass!? That's beautiful! I should've known you'd be good at compliments after all the years you've had to practice!
[k]

[charaFace D 9]
＠Senji Muramasa
Don't get the wrong idea. I never said you'd bloomed[sr]yet... [charaFace D 0][bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 0.7]But never mind. It looks like we've got more foes to face.
