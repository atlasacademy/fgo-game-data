...we Torturers are certain it will be regarded as the greatest form of execution known to humankind.

You should be grateful to Her Highness. You have been given the gift of time to repent for your sins.

You are truly fortunate, save that you sadly will not have the opportunity to experience Her Highness's other innovative torture methods.

I would have liked to see her kneeling torture or tree torture myself. Ah, so you already weep in regret.
