Our ship was destroyed in the aftermath of their battle, and we were all washed overboard, including you.
[k]

＠Astolfo
Of course, we tried to pull you out of the water...but the river's current was kind of weird.
[k]

＠Astolfo
I mean, it'd have to be, right? Normally, it'd be pretty easy for a Servant to hop on in and bring their Master back to shore!

There appears to be a dome of some sort surrounding this place providing us with air. I imagine it's a form of magecraft.

What a strange place this is. I'm not even sure what to call it. Underwater Castle? Lakebottom Castle?

No need to worry, [%1].[sr]He's not moving anymore.

Since he'd been gravely wounded in our prior battle, the other Berserker...Penthesilea, right?
[k]

＠Fergus
Anyway, that must have given her enough of an advantage to come out on top.
[k]

＠Fergus
That said, the last time I saw her, she was covered in cuts and bruises, and yet somehow he still doesn't have a scratch on him.

It's odd that he has not disappeared, but instead appears to have simply ceased functioning.

I am uncertain whether he will awaken or not, but for the moment, he poses no danger.

Of course, we could always lop off his head now just to be certain.

At any rate, we have left him out here to serve as your chair for the time being.

Of course, I do not know if it is because we are underwater, or if it is something else...
[k]

＠d'Eon
Regardless, I also believe we should explore this palace, Master. Standing around chit-chatting certainly won't get us anywhere.
