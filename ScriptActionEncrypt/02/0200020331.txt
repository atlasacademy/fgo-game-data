Ah, don't worry about it.[sr]We had business here anyway.

The only reason you all got what you wanted is because you didn't give up on getting it.

Neutral zone or not, this is still Amazon territory. We'd best escape before that terrifying queen of theirs shows.

Besides, we need to tend to the men we just freed.[sr]Come on, let's head back to our hideout.
