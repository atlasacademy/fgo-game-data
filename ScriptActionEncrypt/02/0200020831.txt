I've realized something after fighting them.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Remember those citizens[line 2]errr, subjects[line 2]that were gathered around? I believe they and the Torturers are fundamentally the same thing.

＠d'Eon
It's just my impression...
[k]

＠d'Eon
...but I got an identical feeling from the Torturers we defeated as I did from the subjects.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Their only true difference was their weaponry.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Essentially, I believe that those serving as Torturers are chosen from among the women here.

Maybe that means this whole city could be a threat, kinda like Ys.

Anyway, at least we managed to rescue this guy from being executed. Now we just need to find somewhere safe and catch our breath!
