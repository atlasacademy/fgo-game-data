＠
Here in Mt. Kinbou's Reigandou, I slowly[sr]open my eyes as I feel the morning arrive.
[k]

＠
My heart is still pumping, if only just.[sr]It seems I've lived to see another sunrise.
[k]

＠
I ponder death every time I drift off to sleep.
[k]

＠
Will this be the last time I open my eyes?[sr]Will I ever see anything again?
[k]

＠
Go ahead, laugh if it is funny to you.[sr]It certainly is to me.
[k]

＠
...I mean, I'm Musashi.
[k]

＠
THE Shinmen Musashi. I first killed when I was but eleven. I've defeated many other swordsmen in duels, and I've also wielded my blades in war.
[k]

＠
I won't use the word “countless,” but I will say I've killed a fair number of men in my life.
[k]

＠
So many that even I can't count them any longer.
[k]

＠
If I'm being perfectly honest, I stopped counting after the tenth one or so. Heh, I suppose it just goes to show how even the most heinous things can become mundane with repetition!
[k]

＠Old Man
Heh, heh...
[k]

＠Old Man
Hehehe... Hahaha...[sr]Urk! (Cough, hack)...![shake 0.03 3 3 0.4]
[k]

＠
Ugh, curse this body. Why must it trouble me with a coughing fit now? What a perverse joke it would be for the last of my strength to allow me only to laugh.
[k]

＠
I suppose, though, that such would be a fitting end.
[k]

＠
I have cut down many men,[sr]and cast them aside just as quickly.
[k]

＠
I sought neither to mend others' lives, nor to spare them. If anything, I paid them not heed at all.
[k]

＠
My strategies were all crafted with the intent to kill. What would be the point of letting my emotions get in the way of that!?
[k]

＠
I kill without pity.[sr]I kill without remorse.
[k]

＠
I kill without sorrow.[sr]I kill without anger.
[k]

＠
This is who I am.[sr]I am Shinmen Musashi, founder of the Niten Ichiryu.
[k]

＠
An old swordsman who has spent his entire life killing with all the calm of a smooth pond's surface, absent so much as a single ripple.
[k]

＠Old Man
A swordsman, huh...
[k]

＠
Come to think of it, can I still hold a sword?[sr]Can these old hands still grasp a hilt?
[k]

＠
I think that they can, but let's see.
[k]

＠
I thought I might have a chance to find out at Shimabara last year, but that rebellion ended without me so much as touching a sword.
[k]

＠
A great shame, now that I think about it.
[k]

＠
Perhaps I should have fought on the Christians' side, rather than following orders from Kokura's commanders?
[k]

＠
Had I done that, I would have had a chance to wield swords again. I could have made use of my blades.
[k]

＠
I could even have ended my own life, rather than tarrying around, hoping for fate to catch up to me.

＠
I have none of the fire and passion that the Christians at Shimabara possessed. It is beyond me.
[k]

＠
My strategies have no need of emotions, vengeance, regret. All I need do is kill, cut, and cast away.
[k]

＠
In which case, I suppose I truly do not have any other choice but to remain here and wait.
[k]

＠
Come on then, fate.[sr]Show me what you have in store for my final moments.
[k]

＠
...Well? What's keeping you?[sr]How can I die in peace like this?
[k]

＠
Gods... Buddha...[sr]At this point, I'll even take an oni, or a demon.
[k]

＠
Please, give me more time, so that I may encounter my destiny. It is unlikely that it will follow me down to the bowels of hell.

I'm so full of loathing that I can barely stand it.[sr]I could have sworn I wasn't always this sort of woman.

Even now, I can't feel anything but detestation.[sr]I detest, I detest, I detest, I detest, I detest...

I detest. I detest. I detest. I detest. I detest.[sr]I hate. I hate. I hate. I hate. I hate. I hate.

That is why I shall be the pyre.

I'll use my soul, my Spirit Origin, my body to stoke the fires of fury, and become flame itself. I've decided: I'll go around killing everyone until they all burn to cinders.

I am loathing, I am anger, I am hatred and fury.[sr]Behold how brightly I burn.
