This world is filled with stories, large and small.[sr]King Lear and Macbeth go without saying, of course.

[charaFace A 0]
＠Moriarty
There's also the gangster from China,[sr]the Wolf King, the headless horseman...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Moriarty
Sherlock Holmes and I were part of one such story too.[sr]But none of them truly matter.
[k]

＠Moriarty
What matters right now is another story.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Moriarty
Der Freischütz, the marksman, could hit any target he wished with six out of seven bullets.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Moriarty
But the seventh, controlled by the devil, shot someone precious to him, and he fell into despair.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]


＠Moriarty
Do you understand? In this story, the seventh bullet possesses powers on par with the Grim Reaper.
[k]


＠Moriarty
At the same time, the devil MUST fire the seventh bullet. He has no choice in the matter.

It's controlled by the Devil, right?[sr]We have no way of knowing what it will hit...

[charaFace B 6]

...Ah.

？！

No way. I can't believe it...[sr]That's why you did it, Professor?

＠Moriarty
I see you share Holmes's gift for deduction, Mash.[sr]Indeed, there is nothing and no one I hold precious.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Moriarty
So I agonized over this. I had nothing I cared for enough to turn a meteor into one of the bullets.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Moriarty
Holmes deduced that I used the Holy Grail in order to strengthen the bullets.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Moriarty
...But, he was wrong.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Moriarty
It was the first time that he had ever been wrong in his deductions about me.
[k]

＠Moriarty
For my part, this was practically a gamble.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Moriarty
Furthermore, the odds were very much against me.[sr]As such, I had to tell Bael everything.
[k]

＠Moriarty
On top of that, I also needed him to lose his memory.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Moriarty
This is because he had to see me as “good Moriarty,” and genuinely try to dispose of me.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Moriarty
He agreed to my plan, knowing that it had an extremely low chance of success.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Moriarty
He said it was the only way we would be able to kill[sr][%1].
[k]

？1：You don't mean...

[k]

＠Mash
We know that much is true.[sr]But...if you look at it another way...
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Mash
It also means that he now has someone he would risk his life to protect. Someone precious to him!
[k]

[charaFace B 8]
＠Mash
That's why the bullet is headed towards you![sr]Because that's where...the person he cares about is...

The sheer humanity you have all shown me is remarkable. It reveals true goodness inside you.

But while this makes you strong against evil,[sr]it also makes you weak against other good people.

[charaFace A 1]

Fight fire with fire, evil with evil...

And good with good.
