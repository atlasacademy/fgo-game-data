Good evening, distinguished guests,[sr]and thank you for accepting our invitation.

On behalf of The [%1] Company, I would like to say that we cannot express our gratitude to you for taking your time to be here this evening.

＠Mash (Narrator)
Tonight, we will be performing a story[sr]about the most enigmatic queen in the Bible.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Mash (Narrator)
She was the queen of a prosperous southern nation... Somewhere south of Arabia, or perhaps to the east of Africa.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
This queen was drawn to King Solomon, known far and wide for his peerless wisdom, and decided to journey across the desert to meet him.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Tell me... Do you know what a true desert is like? An endless sea of sand that stretches out past the horizon. A land of death, where not a single drop of water can be found.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
To cross it, the queen ordered hundreds of camels, accompanied by thousands of soldiers and attendants, to form a single file procession.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Each camel was laden with incredible treasures:[sr]gold, jewels, and precious frankincense.
[k]

＠Mash (Narrator)
Our story begins with the queen perched[sr]on a camel, surveying her procession...
