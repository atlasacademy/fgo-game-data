This isn't so bad as wounds go.[sr]It's a mark of Danzo's feelings.

？1：I wish we could have saved her.

＠Musashi
Yeah. Me too.

？2：I want to believe she was telling the truth.

[charaFace A 11]
＠Musashi
...Yeah. I do too.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

？！

＠Musashi
She said she wanted to protect the world.[sr]Even after that bastard destroyed her insides...
[k]

＠Musashi
...That was what she wished for.[sr]Right to the very end.
[k]

＠Musashi
Maybe she thought her death was dishonorable.[sr]Maybe she thought it was all for nothing.

Isn't that right, [%1]?

I've heard of wounds that refuse to close before. Swords that reach the demonic realm sometimes have curses like that.

[charaFace C 2]

So, given that this villain is[sr]calling himself Abe-no-Seimei...
