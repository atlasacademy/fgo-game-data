...Are you insane?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
You want to add another Phantom Spirit? ...All right, but are you sure your hatred can sustain another?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
That Phantom Spirit doesn't hate anyone.[sr]It's solely the faded concept of pure self-interest.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Admittedly, that one ability it has is quite remarkable, but aside from that, it's mediocre at best.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
It is, after all, a mere scientist.[sr]It has a poor physique.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Though that does mean... Very well! This should be interesting. I'll summon it and fuse you at once.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
But I should warn you. During the operation, make sure your hatred for humans never stops.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
It is the source of your strength.

[charaFace A 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
And so fervent that it could turn on us, your comrades, in an instant...

[charaFace A 5]

You have nurtured it, and gone from a Phantom Spirit into a monster capable of killing Heroic Spirits.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
So hate. Loathe. Despise.[sr]Otherwise, you will never defeat that Master.

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Servants are not human.[sr]And in this Shinjuku...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

Run as fast as you can, so that no one can take it from you.

His cold instincts and boiling-hot hatred are his lifeblood; his most potent source of fuel.
[k]

＠
He hates humanity, humans...everything even vaguely associated with people.
[k]

＠
He derives no joy or pleasure from eating them.[sr]It only serves to further stoke the flames of his hatred.
[k]

＠
He is no longer a mere beast.
[k]

＠
No longer content with running around vast plains, he has devolved into a monster wholly devoured by his all-consuming need for revenge.
[k]

＠
You may think it sad, but from his perspective, he couldn't care less.
[k]

＠
The only one who would mourn for him is his beloved wife, and he will never see her again.
[k]

＠
“Without her, what is my purpose?”
[k]

＠
His heart, his flesh, his fangs, his claws, all call out in response...
[k]

＠
Punishment. Absolute punishment.[sr]You were the ones who destroyed me.
[k]

＠
So I will destroy you as well.[sr]I will destroy all of humanity.
[k]

＠
I will keep rending and tearing until my fangs break and my claws go dull.
