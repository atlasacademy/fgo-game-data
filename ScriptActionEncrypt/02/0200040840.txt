Phenex is trapped in the pain of his endless life.[sr]And I'll be making a garden to tend to my wounds.

Delirium. Enlightenment. Fiction.[sr]They will be my tools to end reality.

＠Demon God Räum
This world is rife with legends, with stories that are neither divine, mystical, nor demons incarnate.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
The Mage's Association has a department dedicated to folklore. It is one of the Association's most closely guarded secrets. What's more, it is guarded by Brishsan, one of our king's pupils.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
I will see what I can accomplish by combining these legends with superstition.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
I believe I will start by creating a town steeped in superstition. I will conduct trial after trial there, until I get the results I want.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
We exist solely to save mankind.[sr]However...
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
...neither faith, nor old age, nor permanence, nor hope, has been able to save humanity so far.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
I'm sure you now understand this too, Zepar.[sr]The truth can never save mankind.

Truth is useless. My key lies in superstition. Fiction. Things that don't exist in this universe.

＠Demon God Zepar
Things that don't exist in this universe...? Do you mean you're going to open paths to alternate worlds? Places that don't even exist in parallel dimensions?
[k]

＠Demon God Zepar
That is beyond us. We were born of order and common sense. We are bound by this world's laws.
[k]

＠Demon God Zepar
Even if there are universes outside our own, you have no means of reaching them, and no attunement to them.

＠Demon God Räum
Indeed. But by sheer, mad coincidence, I won't have to reach it myself.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
Humans, Zepar. Humans have already taken care of everything.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
Happily, a fictional mythology describing the fever dreams of a single man just so happened to also describe a higher being from the outer universe.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
The two align perfectly. And a tiny part of that being has left an imprint on this universe.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
Even if every word of this man's story was nothing but sheer delusion, he still succeeded in opening a path.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
This was, doubtless, a prophecy.[sr]And in this mad prophecy, I saw possibilities.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
I will take this madness, this fiction, and make it real. This new reality is what will save mankind.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
...Yes, of course.[sr]We should have seen it all along.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
We could never do it ourselves. This very universe makes it impossible. In which case...
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
...what we needed was a monster from another world, who is not bound by our laws. A being who abides by rules that even we, in our limitless wisdom, cannot comprehend.
[k]

＠Demon God Räum
And it is this fictional Foreigner who will finally put an end to mankind.

This delusion of yours will be your undoing. Your approach already failed fourteen thousand years ago.

You also wished for everyone in the world to be saved...

Isn't that right?[sr]That's why you were invited to Salem, after all.

Your guilt sought solace here. I mean, it IS a truly horrific sin on your hands...

＠Abigail
The people of Earth missed their chance to be judged... Ever since, they have lived with souls unsaved...

Take it from me. If our Ringmaster had any unconscious feelings, it wasn't GUILT for the world.
