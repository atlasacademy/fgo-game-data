Me too. Their smiles are so warm and bright they almost make up for the sun being gone.

Yeah, I'm not sure that's really a good thing,[sr]but I don't think we can do much about it right now.

Hopefully, when they're older...they'll look back on all this as just a weird dream.

？！

Anyway, let's go get the horses![sr]Oh, if there's a white one, I call dibs!

I've always wanted to try riding a white horse at least once!

＠Fuuma Kotarou
There you are, Lady Danzo.[sr]I've been looking for you.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
The horses are all saddled up, so we'll be[sr]heading out now. What are you going to do?
[k]

＠Danzo
I...[sr]I was just thinking about that.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
...I see.
[k]

＠Danzo
...[sr]...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
Lady Danzo, I know this is rude of me,[sr]but can I ask you something personal?
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Are you concerned about this situation as[sr]an agent of the shogunate? As a lone ninja?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
Or is there something else that's weighing on your mind?
[k]

＠Danzo
I...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
Personally, I'd rather you remain here. Things are[sr]bound to be more dangerous than ever at Toke Castle.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Lord Muramasa and myself are Servants. In my case, I can assure you that I'm much tougher than when I was alive.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I can fight without fear of dying from[sr]a stray bullet or a katana wound.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
But you can't.[sr]You belong to this world.
[k]


＠Danzo
...I am nothing more than a mechanical puppet.[sr]There is no need to worry about me.
[k]

＠Danzo
Besides, I...I have already been given orders,[sr]so...if possible, I would like to join you...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
Right, your orders from Lord Tajima. If Lady Musashi ends up fighting a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, you are to accompany her, was it?
[k]

＠Danzo
That's right...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
It's too risky, Lady Danzo.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
We could easily end up fighting one who is even more deadly than Saṃghāta Hell or Kālasūtra Hell.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
We ninja don't specialize in head-to-head combat. All the more so when we're up against such dangerous monsters.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
And I'm sure Lord Tajima wouldn't want to send one of his best subordinates to an early grave.
[k]

＠Danzo
...I greatly appreciate your concern, Lord Kotarou.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Danzo
Still... Yes... Thank you for telling me how you feel.[sr]You have helped me to make up my mind.
[k]

＠Danzo
I will accompany you after all.[sr]Forgive me. I promise I will be of use.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
I see...

Very well.[sr]If you insist on coming along, I won't stop you.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
In that case, we'd better get going, before[sr]Lord Muramasa yells at us for taking too long.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Danzo
That's true. This is a matter of grave[sr]importance, so I will do my best to hurry.
