[k]

We take what we want, we violate what or who we please. But...sometimes we show a bit of love for others when the mood strikes us. We even smile, when we want, as we destroy and consume whatever we wish.

One is a creature whose one and only purpose is killing. A soul who is truly gifted at cutting human bodies apart in the most cold and efficient way possible.
