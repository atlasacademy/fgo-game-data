＠Mata Hari
I agree with Sanson. Prejudice only[sr]takes root in certain environments.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
Abby lives a relatively wealthy life.[sr]At least by the standards of this colony.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
And she seems to have a very good education as well, thanks to Mr. Carter.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
And somehow, even after the loss she's suffered,[sr]she's held onto her natural cheerfulness.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
I think that might be her greatest strength.[sr]...But she still couldn't have done it alone.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
It's only because Tituba, someone else who[sr]knew her parents well, was there beside her.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Mata Hari
It must have been a big help to have a close family friend around to talk to with her parents gone.
[k]

＠Mata Hari
That's why she's taking this so hard. She's afraid she's about to lose someone else she loves...again.

Witchcraft was considered a grave crime against the teachings of God. As such, suspected witches were tried and executed the same as other felons.

Burning someone at the stake was more a form of torture than execution, and also served as a warning to anyone watching...

Including ones about thieves who disguise[sr]themselves as traveling performers.
[k]

＠Hopkins
Indeed, I see now that such a cover would[sr]be perfect for those with larcenous intent.
[k]

＠Hopkins
Cunning clowns win over the children, and obscenely dressed dancing girls beguile good, upstanding men.
[k]

＠Hopkins
They mislead the townspeople with caricatures of bystanders and voyeurs, then take advantage of the commotion to steal from them.
[k]

＠Hopkins
At times they even commit arson or burglary,[sr]and disappear like so much smoke.
[k]

＠Hopkins
Once they leave, they never return to that town, not even caring what manner of evidence they leave behind.
[k]

＠Hopkins
What a foolish, dim-witted notion.
[k]

＠Hopkins
Such greedy bandits could never hope to perform[sr]a refined tragedy, nor a moving comedy...
[k]

＠Hopkins
None could ever compare to King Lear or the Merchant of Venice as I saw them in the London Globe Theatre.
[k]

＠Hopkins
Hahahaha!

？1：Don't lump us in with bandits like that.

I will tell you now that I sent a messenger down to Boston to visit someone who knows the city well...
[k]

＠Hopkins
...and he reported back that no one had ever heard of a troupe calling themselves “The [%1] Company.”
[k]

＠Hopkins
That is not, in itself, a significant problem...
[k]

＠Hopkins
Massachusetts has not forgotten the Boston witch[sr]trial of John Goodwin from four years ago.
[k]

＠Hopkins
Four children began having strange seizures, and as expected, an old witch was responsible for them.
[k]

＠Hopkins
Indeed, the devil frequently makes use of women for his evil means. How can you be certain that this slave woman is not one of his pawns?
[k]

＠Hopkins
And so I declare that Salem[sr]must be placed on high alert.
[k]

＠Hopkins
There are witches in our midst...

The devil is here in Salem![sr]There is no telling what form he may take!

And you WILL perform. Tonight. You will give a masterful performance that moves everyone here.

And in so doing, you will demonstrate[sr]that you truly are performers.
