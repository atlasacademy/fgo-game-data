At any rate, watch your step. All these changes mean that this Shinjuku Station has fewer exits than it should.

Lose your way within, and you will be doomed to wander its halls until you die. Now, this way.

The ruffians who usually inhabit the station are nowhere to be seen.

Of course, that in itself is not unusual.

But it is strange that their campsite is completely gone from this passageway.

Master. Hypothetically speaking...

If you came here alone and found an empty campsite, shell casings, and blood...what would you think?

Especially not one who remembers that there used to be an unremarkable campsite here.

Most likely, they planned to take their time and surround you before taking you out. As such, they wouldn't have been expecting a surprise attack like this.

There is sure to be a weakness in their defense.[sr]Find it and hit it hard, [charaFace F 2]Master!
