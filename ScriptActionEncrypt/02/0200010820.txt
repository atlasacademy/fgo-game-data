Hehe...hehehehe. You're wrong. She is, without a doubt, my beloved songstress, Christine.
[k]

＠Phantom
A lonely Phantom Spirit. A princess turned doll, since she was never alive to begin with.
[k]

＠Phantom
A sad doll who had everything but her songs taken.[sr]As a doll, Christine was broken from the start.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Phantom
It was my dream, my desire, that broke her.[sr]Thus, it is only right that I am now her subordinate.

If any of us were robbed of something essential to who we were, it would drive us mad too.

＠Archer of Shinjuku
...In that case, Erik, that leaves no room for doubt: you are the Berserker.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Instead of taking responsibility, you have abandoned it utterly. In your cruelty, you have chosen to sacrifice yourself and Christine in a spiral of mutual destruction.

[charaFace B 2]

And if that weren't enough, you have also sacrificed hundreds of lives along the way!

Let's break them all, let's kill them all, let's fight them all, let's sing.

My song must be heard throughout the world, since this world is already coming to an end.
