Call this place whatever you like.[sr]What's important is that this is our hideout.
[k]

＠Rider
It's in a valley surrounded by rocky cliffs on all four sides. Undiscoverable from the outside.
[k]

＠Rider
The walls are pretty much impossible to climb, and the only way in or out is that cave we just went through.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]
＠Rider
We were very lucky to just happen across it.[sr]It's the perfect place for our hideout.

I don't know if I'd go that far, but we did all right.

Come on, you freed all the men in that town, right?[sr]How's that not a success?
[k]

[charaFace F 6]
＠Rider
Haven't we gone over this before?[sr]It's about the war, not the battle.

＠Rider
Modest victories are certainly good enough for me. What matters is that we keep moving forward, even if it's just one small step at a time.

That is how you can always be sure to get where you're going.

Sure, help yourself to the peaches. For some reason, they grow all the time here, so we never run out.

You grow sick and tired of having nothing but peaches after a while, but at least we don't have to worry about food here in the Resistance. Haha!

They didn't. Every one of them I've talked to says pretty much the same thing.
[k]

＠Rider
They say a hole suddenly opened up underneath them, and the next thing they knew, they were here.
[k]

[charaFace F 6]
＠Rider
Near as I can tell, it sounds like something's abducting them from the surface and sending them here.
[k]

＠Rider
We've seen men rain down from the sky on a few occasions ourselves.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Rider
There doesn't seem to be any sort of common factor in where they come from, either. They drop in from all over the place as far as we can tell.

I can't speak to the specifics, but they look to be somewhat like us[line 2]like Servants.

At least inasmuch as they suddenly appeared down here for some reason. Call it a hunch.
