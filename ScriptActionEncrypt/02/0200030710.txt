＠
Here in Mt. Kinbou's Reigandou, I open my eyes once again, even as I feel my death steadily approaching.
[k]

＠
Well? It's still not here yet? I know I'm going to die.[sr]I'm sick and tired of waiting around for it to happen.
[k]

＠
Indeed. I, Shinmen Musashi, will die here...
[k]

＠
No manner of villain or sorcery will work on me now. My body has long been pushed beyond its limits, to the point where I am practically a corpse already.
[k]

＠
My decrepit old body will no longer even move. I can feel my life growing shorter whenever I stand and walk.
[k]

＠
I have grown old.[sr]Very, very old.
[k]

＠
Boredom, joy, sadness...[sr]Such things are little more than bags under my eyes.
[k]

＠
No doubt Iori would laugh if he saw me now. He would say that after all my harsh scolding, my own mind has still failed to reach emptiness.
[k]

＠
But he would be wrong. I have reached it.[sr]I've done so by killing and killing, over and over and over.
[k]

＠Old Man
...And now, I am alone.[sr]Through the void, I have attained emptiness.
[k]

＠
Say, I'm doing well this morning. I was able to speak without my throat screaming for mercy or doubling over in a fit of coughing.
[k]

＠
Well, fate, what are you waiting for? It's now or never. Not only am I still alive, I'm in the best shape I've been in a long time!
[k]

＠
Hmm, can't believe I got angry like that. Niten Ichiryu is supposed to be all about keeping one's mind clear.
[k]

＠
Alas, it seems I can't stop my own immaturity from bubbling up to the surface! That is how a boy is supposed to behave, not an old man at the end of his life.
[k]

＠
Now that I think of it...
[k]

＠
My father used to do much the same thing.[sr]I suppose I really am Munisai's son.
[k]

＠
My father was strong, both with the jitte and the sword. He was unquestionably a true master.
[k]

＠
And yet, he was never satisfied. He was as stubborn as any fool. I recall it gave me no end of trouble.
[k]

＠
...Does that mean that my own impatience here on death's door is a curse I inherited from him?
[k]

＠
Unsatisfied with my fame.[sr]Unsatisfied at my death.
[k]

＠
Perhaps it is my name. Perhaps I should never have inherited “Shinmen” from Munisai? Perhaps going by Miyamoto Musashi better suited me?
[k]

＠Old Man
No. No...[sr]This is...my...
[k]

＠
No. This is my failure and my failure alone.
[k]

＠
I think of death whenever I close my eyes.[sr]I think of it whenever I open them.
[k]

＠
Even in this decrepitude, I cannot fully resign myself. After a lifetime of never encountering my fate, I grow tired of waiting for it to arrive.
[k]

＠
Come on, fate! Where are you? Show me what[sr]you have in store for my final moments.
[k]

＠
...My life is more fragile now than a candle being in the wind. I cannot take it anymore. Please! Come for me!
[k]

＠
Gods... Buddha...[sr]At this point, I'll even take an oni, or a demon.
[k]

＠
Please, give me more time, so that I may encounter my destiny. It will surely lose sight of me down in the bowels of hell.

[charaFace A 12]

＠Musashi
You wouldn't believe what a jerk old man Tajima is! Instead of rewarding me for my hard work, he just stuck me with another job!
[k]

＠Musashi
As if taking down Inferno wasn't enough, now he wants me to go around checking all of Shimousa to make sure those monsters that scattered aren't causing any trouble.
[k]

＠Musashi
At least he lent me a horse so I don't have to do[sr]it all on foot, but that's not the point, you know?
[k]

＠Musashi
I took down a major baddie.[sr]He should be giving me a medal or something!
[k]

＠Musashi
I mean, I know I'm just a vagrant who's not tied down to anything, so I'm sure it's a lot easier to use me up than an officer.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Musashi
Ugh, I'm exhausted.[sr]There's not a single monster to be found anywhere.
[k]

＠Musashi
All that riding around Shimousa,[sr]and all I have to show for it is a sore back.
[k]

＠Musashi
Maybe monster hunting is one of those things where you only find what you're looking for once you stop looking for it.

Anyway, this should finally take[sr]care of the second job he gave me...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Musashi
...Hmm.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]

＠Musashi
Then again, I can't say this was a complete waste of time. It's all part of my training to reach the void.
[k]

＠Musashi
I've been to all sorts of places and fought all sorts of opponents, but I still haven't been able to reach it.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
The void is really different from fire and water. It's all about clearing your mind, counting your blessings, and how you live your life.
[k]

＠Musashi
They have the same idea in the Shinkageryu, although there, they call it “Suigetsu.” Basically, the idea is that nothing is something, and vice-versa.
[k]

＠Musashi
Anyone can cut something with shape and form.
[k]

＠Musashi
But the void that I'm trying to reach...
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
[wt 0.4]

＠Musashi
...is about being able to use your blade to cut the formless, the shapeless.
[k]

＠Musashi
...The word “Muni” in my father's name means[sr]“second to none.”
[k]

＠Musashi
Munisai was truly number one when it came to the sword. Now, I'm trying to achieve a sword of nothingness, of zero, that surpasses him.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Musashi
But, I don't know if I'll ever get there. (Sigh)...[sr]I bet even Lady Kannon must be pretty fed up by now.
[k]

＠Musashi
I've wandered across all sorts of different time periods and places...
[k]

＠Musashi
...faced more opponents and overcome more trials than any other swordmaster, and I still can't reach it.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Musashi
Still...[sr]This might be my best, my FINAL chance...
[k]

＠Musashi
The Heroic Spirit Swordmasters. Servants.[sr]Purgatorio. Inferno.
[k]

＠Musashi
Ordinarily, I'd never be able to handle them all on my own. If I can face off against those demons and survive...
[k]

＠Musashi
...that's when I'll find out what fate has in store for me. The point when I'll find out who I am, and who I'll be when I meet my end...
[k]

＠Musashi
However it turns out, I'm sure I'll be satisfied.

Knight, huh? Odd word, but it somehow speaks to me. Where'd you pick up a word like that?

Oh, it's nothing special. Servants gain some knowledge automatically, since our Master is from the 21st century.

As far as I know, that's true for most Chaldean Servants.

Hmm, so Servants all have knowledge of the time period they're summoned to, but don't have to be people who lived in that time?

I don't really get it, but, basically,[sr]you're all better now, right?
