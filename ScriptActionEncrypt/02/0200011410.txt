The first time I ate a human felt absurdly good.
[k]

＠
My pack is dead. All of them, dead.
[k]

＠
They were poisoned, and died painfully.[sr]Their heads were blown off by those long sticks.
[k]

＠
They were choked to death with rope. Dead, dead, dead. Each and every one of them, dead.
[k]

＠
Blanca is dead too. So are my pups, no doubt.
[k]

＠
...How methodical. Instead of instinct, they use their intelligence to kill efficiently.
[k]

＠
A beast like me could never understand.[sr]Even if I were to be reborn, all I could do is use my jaws.
[k]

＠
I didn't like the idea of someone riding me at first, but he doesn't say anything or get in my way.
[k]

＠
All he does is kill people automatically as I run.[sr]I can live with that.
[k]

＠
I've killed so many people. I thought I would kill as many of them as they did of us.
[k]

＠
Males, females, small ones, big ones, fat ones, thin ones... It's okay to kill all of them!
[k]

＠
Nobody can stop me. I won't let them stop me!
[k]

＠
Every time I took revenge, I was sure that things would go back to the way they were. That someday, I would once again return to the land where my pack and I roamed.
[k]

＠
I was so sure of it.[sr]And yet...
