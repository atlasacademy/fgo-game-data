No matter how great his control over Shinjuku may be, it is not enough to destroy the world.

To destroy the planet...one would need enough energy to match that scale.
[k]

＠Moriarty
That energy would then need to be focused toward the earth's core...a central destruction point.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Moriarty
Naturally, this is far easier said than done. The sheer amount of energy required for such a task is incomprehensibly massive.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

For example...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

A meteor. A meteor falling to Earth would easily meet such energy requirements.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Moriarty
But of course, there is no reliable way to predict such an occurrence.
[k]

＠Moriarty
Such a thing may generate the requisite energy, but it would not be possible for it to hit the necessary target.
[k]

＠Moriarty
In which case, the next thing one would need is a device designed to draw in a passing meteor and direct its impact to the desired coordinates.

But upon re-reading his book, “The Dynamics of an Asteroid,” I finally understood.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
He plans to control a meteor using his Servant abilities.
[k]

＠Holmes
That is why he needs a Phantom Spirit's power. The power to hit a target, no matter the circumstances.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]
＠Holmes
Thus! The Phantom Spirit he has summoned is none other than Der Freischütz: Max, the Freeshooter.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
A hunter who made a deal with the devil for seven magical bullets. That is who Moriarty has absorbed!
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

Hmm... What we really need is sexiness.
[k]

？1：Did you just say “sexiness”?

＠Moriarty
But of course! It's absolutely crucial!
[k]

？2：Did I just hear what I think I heard?

＠Moriarty
Hm? It must be your imagination![sr]My plan is foolproof!

Moriarty's plans may appear nonsensical, but in hindsight, they nearly always work out well.

I understand your concerns, but I think it's worth rolling the dice on.

All right then, everyone, we're off to the city to buy clothes! And by buy, I of course mean steal.

Oh yes, without a doubt. As for you, Holmes, I shall let you land the final blow.
[k]

＠Holmes
Good grief. I know this was my idea, but your plan is exceptionally reckless...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Moriarty
Master, just to make sure, is it all right with you to proceed with my plan?
[k]

？1：I'm not thrilled about this, but...

[charaFace A 0]
＠Moriarty
Naturally, the particulars will need to be adjusted on the fly. But the crucial will not change.
[k]

＠Moriarty
We must assassinate the Assassin of Shinjuku.
[k]

？2：What other choice do we have?

[charaFace B 5]
＠Holmes
Indubitably.

I agree it's rather reckless, but it also makes full use of everything we bring to the table.

I trust it will work out.
