...It happened late at night.
[k]

＠
For some reason, I was already awake.[sr]I don't think it was because I heard anything.
[k]

＠
All I know is that I saw fire flickering[sr]before my eyes right before I opened them.
[k]

＠
They were the reddest flames I had ever seen...almost ugly in their transience.

Did I wake you? Sorry about that. But it's probably[sr]good you're up, 'cause it looks like it's our turn.
[k]

？1：Our turn?
？2：Wait, you don't mean...

？！

＠Musashi
Let's get out of here. Make sure not to wake up[sr]Onui or Tasuke. We should let Kotarou sleep, too.
[k]

＠Musashi
Let's not involve the nice geisha putting us up either.[sr]We handle this alone, just you and me. Okay?
[k]

？1：Of course. Let's sneak out of here.
？！

＠Musashi
Right. Okay, easy does it.[sr]Try not to make a sound.

And here I thought these things didn't show[sr]up in towns. If they've come all this way...[charaFace A 12]
[k]

＠Musashi
...that must mean they came here looking for us. And I don't think they're just trying to keep us from getting a good night's sleep.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Musashi
I'm betting you're all here to get revenge[sr]for the one we killed. Am I wrong?

？1：I guess these monsters don't have much to say.
？2：Looks like they're not much for conversation.

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
Nope. I'm starting to think of them more like weeds that keep popping up no matter how many times you pluck them.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Musashi
Or like those little bugs that show up around watering holes on really hot days. At least these monsters don't show up indoors.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Musashi
Still, not much choice in the matter.[sr]We gotta deal with them.
[k]

＠Musashi
Since everyone else in town is fast asleep, let's take them out as quickly as possible so we can catch a few winks ourselves.
