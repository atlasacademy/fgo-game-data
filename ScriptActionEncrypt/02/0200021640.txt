Indeed. Laputa will not stop. It will only continue on its path towards the destruction of fantasy.

My my, what a horrible voice. That sounds more in line with what his legend describes. Perhaps it has something to do with his new form.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
At least he's talking in normal sentences now. Is that his new form, or did the poetry just get old? Either way, it certainly simplifies matters.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
At any rate, I suppose we shouldn't be surprised that a demon of death and rebirth is hard to kill.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
At the risk of being repetitive, he's technically already dead. That goes for both the human he's using as a vessel, and the Demon God Pillar himself.
