＠Wu Zetian
Tell me... Do you know why I'm an empress?[sr]Was I born to it? No. Absolutely not.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
I was an ordinary girl, daughter of a lowly government official.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
After my father died, and my relatives took me in, they would beat me merely to pass the time.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
There is but one reason why I rose from such lowly origins to sit atop all of China...
[k]

[charaFace H 2]
＠Wu Zetian
...because I wished it, set my heart on it, and worked towards it!
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
I studied books and martial arts! I learned the ways of charm and allure! I cast off everything I didn't need and polished what I did to its utmost!
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Wu Zetian
I worked day and night, foregoing leisure and rest.[sr]I trained myself to ignore my relatives' distractions.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
And even once my beauty was recognized, and I was admitted into the emperor's palace, I didn't stop.
[k]

[charaFace H 2]
＠Wu Zetian
I killed the emperor's wife. His concubines![sr]So many others I quickly lost count!
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
I used poison, cunning, power...everything at my disposal to kill all who stood in my way!
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
Indeed, I rose through pure dedication, as it was the sole method that let me achieve my goals!
[k]

[charaFace H 5]
＠Wu Zetian
And so I gained all of China as my prize.[sr]And I did so entirely on my own!

I am told that when I was a baby, a monk prophesized that I would one day ascend to the highest domain.

When I learned about this, I was furious at him for sticking his nose into my affairs.

It was not providence that brought me to the top![sr]I would never permit something like that to interfere with my endeavors!

I stand here now on my own two feet. As such, I am the only one who decides when those feet will move.
[k]

＠Wu Zetian
There is no one else who helped me get here[line 2]no others who are responsible for my success. There was no sage's admonition, no fool's blade, no impassioned entreaty pushing me upward!

We were all still running away, desperately trying to put some distance between us and the city, when I heard a sound and looked back.

There...I could see the largest building in the whole city, glowing impossibly bright as flames consumed it.

One of these monsters was, of course, the “natural disaster.” The other, hard as it is to believe...

＠Resistance Boy
...looked to be a smaller, yet equally destructive disaster of a sort. I could just be seeing things, but I could have sworn they were evenly matched.
