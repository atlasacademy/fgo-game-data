Lord Tajima has told me a few things about Servants,[sr]but I still do not know much about them. However...
[k]

＠Danzo
They sound as though they are dead people returned to life. So then, what is the difference between Heroic Spirit Swordmasters and Heroic Spirits?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Danzo
According to what you have said,[sr]it sounds as though they are both more than that.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Heroic Spirits are heroes who left a significant mark[sr]on human history, and Servants are their shadows.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
These Servants far exceed the capabilities of ordinary people, and many are exceptionally powerful warriors.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
For example, a single Servant joining a battle could[sr]lead anyone to victory against an entire army.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Danzo
A whole army... That sounds just like the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters who burned down Hitachi and wiped out Sagami.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
True. That's because the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters[sr]are Servants that have been twisted to do evil.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Danzo
I...see...?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
...I-in fact, I'm a Servant myself.[sr]Oh, but I'm not a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Danzo
I see.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Y-yes, that's right.
[k]

＠Danzo
...I see...[sr]I did not know that...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
I-I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.[sr]I couldn't think of a good way to broach the subject, so...

＠Fuuma Kotarou
As for Saṃghāta Hell and Kālasūtra Hell... They're Servants who ended up becoming Heroic Spirit Swordmasters.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
They may once have been Shuten-Douji and Minamoto-no-Raikou, but whatever they were in life, they are now Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, and have become the vicious creatures we saw for ourselves.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
At least, that's my best guess based[sr]on everything we know so far.
[k]

＠Danzo
...?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
However, in their particular case,[sr]there is something else. It's...um...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I hesitate to bring this up, but I think it's important that we all be aware of it. That goes for you too, Master.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
Before Shuten-Douji and Minamoto-no-Raikou[sr]were Heroic Spirits, they were oni.
[k]

？1：Shuten-Douji is, like, the queen oni.
？2：Raikou has Ushi-Gozen...an oni side to her.

？！

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Right. Shuten-Douji may be more overtly oni than Raikou, but oni blood still runs through both of their veins.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
And we can't deny the possibility that this may be affecting how they are as Heroic Spirit Swordmasters.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]
＠Danzo
Oni...you say?
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
And as for me[line 2]

Come to think of it, Tomoe Gozen seemed[sr]like she was using some oni power as well.
[k]

？1：She WAS really strong.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Musashi
I'll say. I've never seen anyone use a bow[sr]like that before. It was downright terrifying.
[k]

？2：If we ever get to meet her again, then...

＠Musashi
Yeah. I'd love to meet her again some day,[sr]without any animosity between us.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 4]
＠Musashi
Anyway, oni, huh...[sr]I've had run-ins with oni before too.
[k]

＠Musashi
There were a bunch around when [%1] and I first met, of course, but that was far from the only time.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Musashi
So I've got a few thoughts of my own based on my experiences, if you'd like to hear them.
[k]

＠Musashi
Basically...there are many different types of oni.
[k]

[messageOff]
[wt 0.7]
[charaFace A 12]

＠Musashi
First: creatures outside the domain of humans,[sr]the uncivilized and untamable.
[k]

＠Musashi
Second: the descendants of abominations that possess power outside of what is categorically within human capacity.
[k]

＠Musashi
And third: beings whose hatred of this world was so intense that it gave them corporeal form and could never be pacified.
[k]

＠Musashi
...Some were even born like that because[sr]of how they were portrayed in stories.
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 0]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
So there are oni that live outside humans' domain, oni that possess supernatural power, and oni that come from stories.
[k]

[charaFadeout B 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 0]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Musashi
Right.[sr]Now, let's go back to the Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Musashi
It may not mean much, but I happened to notice something they have in common. I guess you can think of this as a kind of thought experiment?
[k]

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Musashi
By definition, Heroic Spirits are heroes, right? And it's not like just any samurai who made a name for himself on the battlefield can become one, right?
[k]

＠Musashi
Some of them are people who, say, rebelled against[sr]a cruel feudal lord to save others, right?
[k]

？1：Spartacus would be an example of the latter.
？2：I guess that kinda fits Boudica.

？！

＠Musashi
What's more, they can do a lot more than any human. It may not be true for all of them, but most Heroic Spirits are really strong, right?
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 0]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
Right. Just the fact that their bodies aren't harmed by ordinary attacks makes them exceptionally dangerous.
[k]

[charaFadeout B 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 0]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Musashi
In which case, the first two kinds of oni I mentioned above half-apply to Heroic Spirits too.
[k]

＠Musashi
Some Heroic Spirits are unbound by human mores,[sr]and some far exceed human capabilities.
[k]

＠Musashi
As for the third kind...
[k]

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 4]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
...I see what you mean.[sr]You're right; that might not be too different either.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Fuuma Kotarou
Some Heroic Spirits are born from concepts and stories...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
And some are summoned as Servants who have been transformed into monsters by the effects of those concepts and stories.
[k]

[charaFadeout B 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 0]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

Similarities...?

[charaTalk A]

[charaFadein A 0.1 1]
＠Musashi
Right. They're very similar, but only at a superficial level. At their heart, they're fundamentally different.
[k]

＠Musashi
The major difference between heroes and oni is the[sr]fact that oni-kind can never coexist with humans.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Musashi
At heart, oni are twisted, warped creatures. They could smile one moment, and devour someone they love the next.
[k]

＠Musashi
Everything about them can change in an instant.
[k]

＠Musashi
A complete and total inversion...like it was nothing.
