Yup. Sure did!

I gave her some medicine to alleviate her shock from the blood loss right after she collapsed.

[charaFace D 4]

＠Circe
But...I'm afraid there's nothing else I can do to help her... I'm sorry.
[k]

＠Circe
The anesthesia is the only thing keeping her going, but all it's doing is helping with her pain...

Nezha was right about that.[sr]Besides...

[charaFace F 4]

＠Mash
...I think it would be the height of arrogance to interfere in other people's lives to try to save someone at this point.
[k]

＠Mash
To try and rob someone of their chance to repent, and make amends...
[k]

[charaFace F 8]

＠Mash
If anything, I'm the one who should be punished for acting so thoughtlessly...
[k]

？1：...I see.
？2：You regret having asked Lavinia for help.
？！

[charaFace F 4]

＠Mash
...Yes. And I think I always will.

＠Mash
But, even so...[sr]Lavinia, I'm so grateful to you.

I pray that your soul finds its way home[line 2]back to where your family is waiting for you.
