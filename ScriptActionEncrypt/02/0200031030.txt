I'm glad to see you're at least somewhat proficient in battle. What a disappointment it would be if you weren't.

We have been stretching our legs and visiting some far-off places, but it's the same letdown everywhere we go.

It's so dreadfully boring. I don't expect you to be on par with the Great Tsuchigumo, but at the very least...

[charaFace E 7]

...I hope you could put up as much of a fight as an oni.

You think I don't know that? That's why I'm just[sr]letting them ramble on and not doing a damn thing.

This does differ slightly from the Lord Sorcerer's plans, but that's just what happens when we Heroic Spirit Swordmasters are involved.

If I strike my sword here, the enemy's blade will shatter. If I swing it here, the enemy's head will fly eight paces.
