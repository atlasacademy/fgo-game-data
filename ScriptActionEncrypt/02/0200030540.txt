＠Musashi
I was hoping that would be the end of it...
[k]

＠Musashi
...but I guess that was too much to ask for. Hey, c'mon out and show yourself! I already know you led those spirits here.
[k]

＠Musashi
I've heard that Servants have a unique aura about them, but I doubt that's what I'm picking up from you.
[k]

＠Musashi
You still stink of villainy just like before! Except[sr]now it's a stench of burning scum instead of blood.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Musashi
Either way, you should have the decency not[sr]to go out in public smelling that horrible!
[k]

＠Musashi
If you gotta smell like something burning,[sr]how about you try incense?

＠Archer of Inferno
What a strange creature you are, Shinmen Musashi. I'd never have thought to look for advice from someone I was about to kill.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
Very well then. Thank you for your suggestion.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
I shall take that into consideration, and attempt[sr]to light incense whenever I go out from now on.

I must thank you for all your help the other day. Have you been keeping well since then? I've come here today to slaughter you all.

Good day, and goodbye.

Huh? Where did that come from?

[charaFace G 2]

＠Archer of Inferno
Well, speaking for myself, I would say I want[sr]to burn all things. Lives. People. Sworn enemies.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Archer of Inferno
Burning things is what I do. I only love killing.[sr]People. Japan. Everything to do with Tokugawa society.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
I shall burn, and burn, and burn, until there[sr]is nothing left. I cannot speak for the others...
