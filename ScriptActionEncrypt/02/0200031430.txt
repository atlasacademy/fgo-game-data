...This is the same castle we were at before, right?

[charaFace A 4]
＠Musashi
Look at how much it's changed. If there was ever a castle made just for monsters, this would be it.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Musashi
Danzo was right about this place. I can't even imagine how much evil stuff you'd have to mix together to get something like this.
[k]

＠Musashi
I can see why that missionary guy had a lot to say about it. No wonder there's no one else around.

Do you hear that, [%1]? Is it just me, or does it sound like the castle has a heartbeat...?
[k]

？1：It's not just you. It's like a living creature.
？2：So this is where the sorcerer and Kiyohime are...

Sheesh. They're not even trying to be subtle, are they?
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
And here I was wondering where our enemy[sr]had hidden their base of operations...
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
I guess they deserve some credit since we didn't find their hideout before this happened. Now they've got us on the defensive.

But, that all ends tonight.[sr]Are you guys ready for this?

Of course. I won't back down now.[sr]Not after having come this far.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I may not be fully recovered, and Master's wound may[sr]not yet be healed. But, [charaFace B 1]as long as we're all together, I can't imagine us losing.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Let's go. It's time to settle this once and for all.
[k]

？1：We'll be facing the sorcerer, and two Swordmasters.
？2：They could be a gauntlet, or a battle royale.

True, and we don't know which it'll end up being. But the important thing is that we're ready for anything. Now, we just need to figure out how to get inside this creepy-looking castle[line 2]

No more grumbling. Let's cut our way through[sr]these things and make our way inside!
