It doesn't matter how much you change your appearance if your gait remains the same.

＠Edmond Dantès
Ruffians, police officers, yakuza...[sr]Each has their own distinct way of walking.

＠Edmond Dantès
[&Mr.:Ms.] [%1], allow me to introduce you.[sr]This is Mr. Kaburagi.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
He runs a general store here in Shinjuku.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
He has everything from Demonic Beast corpses to guns that will even work on wraiths.

[charaFace A 2]
＠Edmond Dantès
Aha, I see what's going on.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Today I'm here with someone who seems like they'd make a good hostage, so you were hoping to abduct them in order to threaten me! Isn't that right?

Haha, I can't put anything past you! Well, now you've seen through it, I won't give you any trouble!
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Edmond Dantès
Good. Now, I'll take twenty of the usual, please.
[k]

＠Kaburagi
You got it. By the way, Mr. Dantès,[sr]I've got a question for ya.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Edmond Dantès
And what might that be?
[k]

＠Kaburagi
Do you think the end is almost here?
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Hmm... Yes, it may well be.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Edmond Dantès
But that doesn't change what needs to be done, does it? You still have to collect, sort, and sell your wares.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
It may not be a proud profession.[sr]At times, you may have to sully your hands.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Edmond Dantès
But so what? What is there to be afraid of?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Edmond Dantès
You should be proud, Mr. Kaburagi.[sr]Just do what you need to.
[k]

＠Kaburagi
I'll keep that in mind. By the by, I also have some new Demonic Beasts in, if you fancy that?
[k]

＠Kaburagi
They could make great pets. They're very friendly, and not a bit picky when it comes to food!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]
＠Edmond Dantès
No thanks.
[k]

＠Kaburagi
What about you, young [&man:lady]![sr]Interested in a nice Demonic Beast?
[k]

？1：Fou's all I need, thanks.

[charaFace C 1]
＠Kaburagi
Do my ears deceive me!?[sr]You say you already have a Demonic Beast for a pet?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]
＠Kaburagi
What sort of beast? Is it the kind that would kill a dreamy-eyed Caster on sight?
[k]

？2：What kind of beast ya got?

＠Kaburagi
A genetically modified Chimera.[sr]I call it a Super Chimera myself.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠Kaburagi
...What? You don't need one?[sr]You had a bad experience with one before?
[k]

？！

Yes. We'll soon be meeting up with the others, after all. ...I believe her hideout was somewhere around here.

＠Holmes
Ah, there we go.[sr]All right, shall we go get lectured?
[k]

But of course, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].
[k]

＠Holmes
I'm afraid those two will be absolutely livid after spending the evening worrying so much about you.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Holmes
Hahaha, I see you now understand the situation we're in. Come then, let us be off!
