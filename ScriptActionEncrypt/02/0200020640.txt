If you want to be taken by the genuine article and experience something truly mind-blowing...
[k]

＠Dahut
All you have to do is close your eyes and come to me.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]
＠Dahut
Oh, but...this won't do.
[k]

＠Dahut
Now that you're proving difficult to acquire, I'm starting to desire other things!
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Dahut
Quick! I must have it all![sr]I must have everything I want!
[k]

[charaFace D 4]
＠Dahut
I want them so badly.
[k]

＠Dahut
I want a blue rose that has been watered with the blood of a thirteen-year-old virgin.
[k]

＠Dahut
I want the sweat dripping from the hands of a composer with a fatal disease as he plays the last beautiful notes of his career.
[k]

[charaFace D 10]
＠Dahut
I want the ashes of a book of romance whose cover has been coated with crushed jasper and human bones!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Dahut
Give them to me. Give me the joy that comes with getting what I desire.
[k]

I'll throw away everything else I've ever wanted to get that!

＠Rider
You're a fool. Taking, discarding, taking, discarding... Do you really think that's sustainable?
[k]

＠Rider
The world's resources are finite.[sr]Eventually, everything runs out.
[k]

＠Rider
All that plundering and momentary happiness you love so much, it will end one day. It's only a matter of time until you've taken everything there is to take.
[k]

＠Rider
When that happens, you'll be left with nothing. A void that won't be filled even after it's consumed you.
[k]

＠Rider
When there's nothing left to take, the only thing you'll be left with is your own desire to do so.
[k]

＠Rider
And by then...it'll all be over. You can't keep the world going[charaFace E 2] if all you do is take and never produce!

＠Dahut
All I want is for this city I was given to flourish forever.
[k]

＠Dahut
To have its people live out their lives in endless joy and pleasure.
[k]

＠Dahut
And for that, I'm proud to call myself its ruler.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Dahut
I don't care what rest of the world thinks of me.[sr]I don't even care if they call me a demon!
[k]

[charaFace D 10]
＠Dahut
I am Dahut. The daughter of Gradlon, and the ruler of Ys.
[k]

＠Dahut
I am noble by birth. I am the debauched witch who turned her back on Saint Guénolé!
[k]

＠Dahut
In spite of that, my people, who love the joy they take for themselves, see me as their ruler.
[k]

[charaFace D 2]
＠Dahut
Now come, my people, sing the praises of your lord.[sr]Let us lose ourselves in these endless pleasures!

No matter how hard things may seem...
[k]

＠Rider
...as long as you know what it is you have to do, you still have a chance. So I'm not giving up.

Hell, not knowing when to give up is the best weapon I've got! So come on, [&boy:lady]! Time to hold our ground!
