＠Da Vinci
Okay, now that we've studied the new information, and you've had some rest, let's discuss our next move.

＠Da Vinci
Which of the three cities and their respective rulers would you suggest we pay a visit to first, Rider?

＠Rider
Hmm... I think I'd go with the water one.
[k]

＠Rider
There's a whole host of reasons, but the most important is that we were planning to hit it next.
[k]

＠Rider
I've set up a small Resistance camp on the edge of their territory, so we can stop there to resupply.
[k]

？1：No arguments here. Let's do it.
？2：Getting to rest on the way sounds good to me.
？！

Well if you're all set to attack this water city thing, then it'd make sense for us to go there, too!

By the way, Rider...
[k]

＠Mash
The names “El Dorado” and “Nightless City” for the other two cities both sound kind of familiar...
[k]

＠Mash
Does this water city happen to have a name like that as well?

＠Rider
Sure does. Did I not mention it before?
[k]

＠Rider
The city we're headed for next is called Ys, the City of Water. It's a decadent town that's built on the surface of the great lake.
