[charaFace B 4]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
The only failure here was in my strategy.[sr]I underestimated Rider's tenacity.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
The hatred that wolf bears is deeper than the ocean itself. The wolf is the one controlling the knight.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
I should have realized it sooner.[sr]Dullahans are only an urban legend.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
They may seem scary, but they're nothing more than a harmless concept; at most they're innocent fright.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
But not that wolf. Its loathing knows no bounds.

It doesn't eat people out of hunger, but out of hatred.

＠Archer of Shinjuku
That hatred is no mere thing of myth, nor is this wolf something that was simply worshipped and abandoned.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
It is a far more direct kind of hatred. The sort that comes from trauma, like having one's wife murdered.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
And I know of only one Phantom Spirit who meets that description.

A being who was once worshipped would never hate humans that much. Certainly not enough to eat them.

You are correct, Master.

A man named Seton once wrote about it.

＠Archer of Shinjuku
He described it as a real-life Demonic Beast:[sr]a monster so smart it was feared as a literal demon.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
He loathed humans for killing his mate, Blanca, and that hate persisted until his death.

＠Edmond Dantès
I only wish I had some good news to follow it.
[k]

？1：Talk to me.
？！

＠Edmond Dantès
Usually, I prefer to make my reports once I've grasped the full truth of a situation.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
In cases where there's no room for conjecture, and ordinary people can't understand what's going on...
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
I step in and conduct rigorous investigations.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
But this time...I'm afraid there was only so much even I could do.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Even though there are still a number of unknowns, I need to pass this information on to you right away[line 2]regrettable as that may be.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
It's incredibly vexing, but I'm afraid I have no choice.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
After all, time is not on our side.[sr]I've never seen this man so desperate.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
He plans everything down to the smallest detail, and thus utterly detests when things take too long.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
So while this method is atypical for him...it also means that everything in my investigation points to him as the culprit.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
In this malicious Shinjuku, the station has become a veritable dungeon, and every building here is in some state of disrepair. However...
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Have you noticed that there was one building which has been completely replaced?
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
...That's right. You've seen it before. That strange tower taking the place of the Metropolitan Government Building. The tower that grows day by day.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
That tower is...the barrel of a gun.
[k]

？1：Huh?
？2：The barrel...of a gun?
？！

＠Edmond Dantès
Hahaha! I don't blame you for being taken aback, Master! But as wild as it may seem, it's the truth.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
The Archer of Shinjuku[line 2]the one who isn't your Servant[line 2]is the leader of the League of Phantom Fiends.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
And I now know what it is he's after.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
He plans to destroy the earth. To obliterate it.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
To tackle that tower, you must first defeat the League of Phantom Fiends.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
The Berserker of Shinjuku, the Assassin of Shinjuku, the Rider of Shinjuku, and one more...
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
An Archer that uses modern-day weaponry.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Jeanne d'Arc Alter knows him well, so you should ask her about him.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
I'm sure you'll be heading out to defeat these Servants as soon as you have a chance of victory.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Who do you plan on facing next?
[k]

？1：The Berserker.
？！

＠Edmond Dantès
Hmm. A reasonable decision.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
The Berserker can be found near Kabukicho.[sr]He's a typical tyrant, an absolute dystopian.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
There's also the logistics problem, what with you being outnumbered, but I'm sure you can handle that.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
The real problem is...well, you.[sr]I'm guessing you'll be presented with a choice.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Though I'm afraid you'll get hurt no matter what decision you make.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
As your guide, let me give you some advice: endure.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Whatever it is, you can take it. Hang on to that nobility of yours, and you'll always be you!
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Oh, and as for the Archer of Shinjuku...
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
...
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Don't trust him too much.[sr]I have no doubt that he is your enemy.

As long as I'm going around investigating like this, the Archer will surely be able to deduce the conclusion I've reached.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
So telling [&him:her] not to trust him is not a stretch by any means.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Edmond Dantès
Anyway, now I just wait to see how he reacts upon learning about this.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
No doubt Master will try to trust him, but some suspicions will surely remain.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
When the time comes, will he attempt to kill [&him:her], or merely deceive [&him:her]?
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Or perhaps he'll do something that not even “I” can predict. Either way, we'll soon find out.
