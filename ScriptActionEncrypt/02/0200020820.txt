That's something kinda funny about this city, don'tcha think?

＠d'Eon
The lights are scattered so haphazardly...[sr]Not a thought is given to order. They may shine bright...
[k]

＠d'Eon
...but their gleam lacks warmth and truth, in stark contrast to the gleam of Versailles.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠d'Eon
...Not that Versailles's gleam was perfectly righteous either.
[k]

＠d'Eon
It was designed to pile extravagance upon extravagance...to show that there was no greater place to be found anywhere in the world.
[k]

＠d'Eon
But this glow is quite the opposite. It has been expanded endlessly, signifying that it has ambitions well beyond where it is now.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Astolfo
Yeah, it does kinda feel like they've just been piling on lights for the sake of doin' it!
[k]

＠Astolfo
The lights are so bright you can't even read what the signs say, and there's so many of them that you're never sure where you're supposed to look.

Indeed. It may have something of a squalid luminescence, but it is a far cry from decadence.

They could be bound by some sort of spell.[sr]We'll have to talk to someone in order to find out.

However, speaking with one of the women may be dangerous. I think it would be best if we were to find a man who was by himself.

No. Judgment is Her Highness's strictest law.[sr]None can avoid it.

The penalty for killing a guard dog is the amputation of your four limbs, so that they may be fed to the other guard dogs.
