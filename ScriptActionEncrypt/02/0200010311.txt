Ha ha ha![sr]My apologies, [charaFace B 4]but I'm afraid I'm completely outclassed.

I would welcome a deus ex machina just now, were such things real!

＠Archer of Shinjuku
By the way, Master, on a completely different subject... Do you know how to drive?
[k]


？1：Uh...
？！

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Well, whether you can or not, I'm afraid you'll have to.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Da Vinci! I presume you can teach the young Master here how to drive in real time?

But I suppose we can discuss that later.[sr]Come on, let's get out of here!

Cunning as he may be, my identity should still be safe since I've managed to stay hidden. However...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Edmond Dantès
I still cannot quite understand what his goal must be in siding with Chaldea. Not to mention that last act of his...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Edmond Dantès
No, that's not possible. He is fundamentally at odds with order. There's not a selfless bone in his body.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
It must be some sort of plot. I'm certain he has ulterior motives guiding his every move.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Edmond Dantès
And yet...I cannot see any meaning to his actions beyond a Servant defending his Master.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Edmond Dantès
This won't do. I always get too worked up when it comes to him.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Edmond Dantès
There's also the question of... No, never mind.[sr][&He:She] should be fine with her.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Now, we only need one more Servant to join Chaldea's side.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Edmond Dantès
Of course, she is fairly twisted, but I can't let that stop me from paying her a visit.
