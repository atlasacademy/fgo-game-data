This is the humanity distortion Lord Babbage arrived at! The foreign entity at the edge of the Incineration of Humanity!

[charaFace E 5]

Lord Babbage was summoned as a Heroic Spirit to serve a Demon God Pillar, which is how he was able to obtain all the relevant numbers.

[charaFace E 3]

The next step, naturally, is to use those numbers in a calculation. Any mathematician would do the same.

Specifically, he calculated a future that assumed the Incineration of Humanity took place, rather than calculating a way to try and prevent the incineration.

Killing him failed to help me win, nor could I outsmart him. So I thought as hard as I could.

＠Moriarty
It's not as though Holmes never makes any mistakes. One need only consider Irene Adler, the woman who once outfoxed him, for that.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Moriarty
But whenever he faces me, he always gives it his all. It's quite vexing. Thus, there was only one way to beat him.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Moriarty
I would have to join his side.

Right, right, sorry. Yes, you're exactly correct.

[charaFace D 5]
＠Moriarty
I reset myself to zero. I removed my memories and evil nature, created a good side, and was reborn.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Moriarty
And not only me. I also removed Bael's memories.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Moriarty
He believed himself to be “evil Moriarty” and acted accordingly, and I did the same as “good Moriarty.”
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Moriarty
Right up to the moment “evil Moriarty” disappeared just now.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]
＠Moriarty
He only thought he was Moriarty, and behaved as such.

＠Moriarty
If he hadn't, we would never have been able to defeat Holmes. Or you.

So I joined your group, and fought with all my strength and conviction at your side.

That is the indisputable truth. Worry not, Master.[sr]You need not feel bad for failing to see through me!

Hahahaha! I'm glad to see you haven't lost your spirit!
