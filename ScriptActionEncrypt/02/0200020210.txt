So that's what the other me you all know is like?[sr]I can't believe it...
[k]

＠Fergus
A brave and earnest man best described as “simple-minded” and “chaotic”?

And on top of that, he's both a warrior who fights like a demon and a relentless womanizer?

(So, spurred on by his indignation at his own immaturity, he trains to overcome his own weakness. Yep. Sounds like Fergus.)

So it seems this is essentially Fergus's past, younger self. Both physically, and in terms of his memories.

But, much as his appearance, personality, and stats may be different, he is still the same Fergus mac Róich we know.

So don't worry, it's safe to trust him.[sr]That said...
