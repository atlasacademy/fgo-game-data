Good morning, Sanson.[sr]Having a late breakfast?
[k]

＠Mash
Oh, what a wonderful smell.[sr]Is that a crêpe?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Sanson
Morning, Mash.[sr]No, this is a buckwheat galette.
[k]

＠Sanson
I heard we'd procured some lovely ham, and found myself hooked after spending some time with the chef.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Mash
So you're using ham, cheese, a soft-boiled egg,[sr]and...is that zucchini? It looks delicious!
[k]

＠Sanson
Thank you. I often had galettes just like this when I was growing up in Paris. They were originally a peasant dish from the Brittany region.
[k]

＠Sanson
It's even said they were served at the palace[sr]of King Louis XIV's mother, Anne of Austria.

[charaFace A 4]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Mash
Oh, right. Exactly.[sr]You couldn't do that because we've run out, right?
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Mash
Apparently someone broke into the kitchen[sr]and stole most of our alcohol...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Sanson
Really?[sr]Was it a thief?

I think so, since a number of rooms also experienced inexplicable blackouts around the same time.

First of all, we know that the alarm[sr]originated in North America.

We're detecting an incredible magical energy signature, but the threat level is fairly low. At least, for now.

＠Da Vinci
At the moment, we're sending in a fleet of investigative drones to collect more intel, and communicating with the local authorities.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We're also coordinating with the North American branch of the Mage's Association, since Chaldeas didn't observe this phenomenon.

However, there aren't many Association agents in[sr]North America, so I doubt they'll be of much help.

It's now been 72 hours since this large-scale disappearance occurred on the east coast of North America, with Salem at its center.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Let me start by telling you what we've learned directly from our own investigation and information gathering.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

＠Da Vinci
First off, we've decided to call the darkness that sprang up out of nowhere to cover all of Salem the “Mist.”
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Given how it absorbs all visible light and other forms of electromagnetic waves, and doesn't obey any laws of physics, we are certain it's an instance of magecraft.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Its scale remains unchanged since it first appeared: as I mentioned earlier, a near-perfect circle with a radius of seven kilometers.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We also now know that the Mist extends upwards[sr]to an average altitude of six hundred meters.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Da Vinci
It's easy to enter this area, but so far,[sr]nothing that has done so has made it back out.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Every one of the unmanned vehicles, unmanned surveillance units, drones, and closed-circuit robots sent in by the US Army has been swallowed up by the dark.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Either that, or they simply ceased functioning the moment they got too close.

＠Da Vinci
This way, we can send you straight to the heart[sr]of Salem without moving you across time.

However, there are two major conditions involved with this plan that I need you to understand, [%1].

As I explained earlier,[sr]we get one round-trip Rayshift, period.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
What's more, the number of people[sr]we can shift is severely limited.

[charaFace D 4]

The Association has already forced us to shut[sr]down the reactor in Chaldea's basement.
