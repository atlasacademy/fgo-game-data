We found you here, collapsed here and with[sr]a terrible injury. I'm sorry it took us so long.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
I used some of my clan's secret ointment to close your wound, but I'm afraid you must have lost a lot of blood...
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
...at least, if these bloodstains[sr]on the ground are any indication.

I know we can't stay here forever, but you should try to get some rest for now. Don't worry, it's still night.

Like Kotarou said, it looks like you lost a whole lot of blood, so I don't think you can stand up just yet anyway. You need get some rest.

Honestly, I wish we could just let you stay here,[sr]but we can't. We need you to fight with us.

We gave you until sunrise, which I think was more than enough time. I was looking forward to watching you all cowering in fear.

But it's only just past daybreak.[sr]Barely even morning.

＠Berserker of Saṃghāta Hell
I know the moon is still out, but that's just what happens whenever we get serious. Sorry about that. I know it's a pain.

Anyway, it's so nice of you to hurry all this way.

We will not be drinking anyone's blood. We will simply follow our karma and allow our Curse of Annihilation to do the rest.

I already ate them. It had been so long since I had children, so I was sure to savor them. I ate every. Last. Bite. I started at the toes and worked my way up.

Even for a lie, that was in extremely poor taste, Saṃghāta Hell. If you'd done that, you wouldn't have bothered taking them hostage in the first place.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Saying you killed them doesn't help you.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Not knowing if they're alive or dead keeps us at a disadvantage. We have to act on the assumption that they're still alive.

If you were just going to throw away that advantage anyway, you wouldn't have needed to kidnap them.
