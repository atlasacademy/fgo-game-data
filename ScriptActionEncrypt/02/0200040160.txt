I thought she would be fine once she got some sleep.[sr]But I was wrong.

She kept groaning and writhing, as if she was fighting off a terrible fever. I tried to give her some bread and water to help her calm down, but she refused.

I was at a loss for what to do next,[sr]so I asked the Reverend to come take a look at her.
