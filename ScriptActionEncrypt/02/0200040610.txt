You're telling me the year in the outside world is 2019? That everything here in Salem is artificial?

I suppose the Harvard Divinity School where I teach, the soldiers I brought back, and even Boston itself don't exist either then, hm?

Ridiculous. I have never heard anything so completely absurd in all my life.

＠Carter
...I admit that things have happened here that seem to defy explanation. And yes, there are the monsters.

But those are only oddities when viewed through the lens of British common sense.
[k]

＠Carter
This is a pious land, so nobody talks about this... Indeed, most simply try to put it out of their minds...
[k]

＠Carter
But the fact is, there is not just one single god in our world. Everyone knows that.
[k]

＠Carter
I have lived among people of different countries in order to study these other gods.

＠Carter
I also know that the Indians here worship their own strange and suspicious gods.
[k]

＠Carter
I've seen a statue of a grotesque obese goddess that was worshipped by a dark cult during the Qing dynasty.
[k]

＠Carter
There are dreadful beings in ancient civilizations, this mysterious New World, and tombs buried under desert sand...
[k]

＠Carter
Horrible, unspeakable things that exist in the vastness of the cosmos, to whom humanity is so insignificant as to be beneath even their consideration.
[k]

＠Carter
[%1], you hail from the Orient, if I'm not mistaken.

Mata Hari's been scouting things out here,[sr]and she just sent us a message.

There's been more hangings.[sr]One last night, and one before dawn today.
[k]

？1：...! Who did they execute?
？！

[charaFace G 0]

＠Robin Hood
The instigators of last night's riot, apparently.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Word has it they were an unpleasant bunch who were always going around fanning the flames of unrest... Or at least, that's the official story now.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Robin Hood
They say these guys were sending ghosts after them, that they'd been possessed by the devil, and that they intentionally instigated the riot last night...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
But really, they're just using this as an opportunity to get rid of people they never liked, or ones they were fighting with over property rights and such.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]

＠Robin Hood
And not only that... Tch...
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Robin Hood
Those sailors we met at the harbor were among the condemned.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
They say they killed the tavern owner just to get out of paying their tab.
[k]

？1：That can't be right...!
？2：They helped us out a lot...
？！

[charaFace G 4]

＠Robin Hood
You said it... They were good guys.[sr]They didn't deserve this.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
...This is bad.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
I can't tell what's real and what's fake anymore.

＠Robin Hood
If this is all part of our forced incarnation...

I've been debating whether I should tell you this, but...

＠Robin Hood
...Mata Hari suggested assassinating Carter as a possible way out of this mess.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
For my part, I kept saying we need to do something about Hopkins ASAP...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
...but Mata Hari's apparently much more worried about Carter.
[k]

？1：What did the Queen of Sheba think?
？！

＠Robin Hood
Don't know. She refused to comment.
[k]

？1：Why's that?
？2：Did she at least give a reason?
？！

＠Robin Hood
Nope. She wouldn't say anything.[sr]Or rather, I don't think she COULD say anything.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Think about it.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
She can see what's gonna happen in the future.[sr]Mata Hari confirmed as much. But...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
...even though she knew about the Demon God Pillar, she still couldn't use that to her advantage here in Salem.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Her role as Tituba may've limited what she could do, but she still should've been able to do SOMETHING.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
We know she exerts a lot of influence just by existing. Maybe that was the trap all along?
[k]

＠Robin Hood
I mean, if she was really a threat to the Demon God Pillar, it wouldn't have given her a role at all.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
So, what I'm getting at here is... This is a heretical land, filled with blasphemies and apostates...
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Robin Hood
A place where even attempting to help only makes things worse, more twisted...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
A land forsaken by God,[sr]where prayers just tumble out into an empty abyss.
[k]

？1：...!? A heretical land...!?

＠Robin Hood
Yup. Even the best of intentions backfire here.[sr]All they seem to get you is a noose around your neck.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
How can I be so sure, you ask?
[k]

？2：Why would you think that, Robin?
？！

[charaFace G 1]

＠Robin Hood
Well... It's not like I firmly belong to any one part of history.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
As a Servant, I'm basically just an actor with a personality made up of a bunch of different parts.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
But thanks to that, it's easier for me to step back and see the big picture than it is for pretty much anyone else.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Robin Hood
I'm still kinda guessing here, but...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
...I think if we end up losing our cool and resorting to violence to try and get this mess sorted out quickly...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
...the foundation propping up this fiction might crumble. It could wreck the whole...plot, I guess.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
And I think the more crimes we rack up,[sr]the more power it might give the Pillar.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
And if that's how it is...all we can do is go along with whatever he's got in mind for us...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
...while we try to figure out how to outsmart him.
[k]

？1：I wasn't able to stop any of the hangings...

[charaFace G 4]

＠Robin Hood
I hate to say it, but I don't think anything about that hanging business can be avoided.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

＠Robin Hood
But just the fact that you're still alive means we've been able to evade its trap so far.
[k]

？2：So, we should fight fiction with...performance?

＠Robin Hood
...Huh, yeah. I guess you could put it that way.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]

＠Robin Hood
I don't wanna give the writers TOO much credit here for putting this all together...
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

＠Robin Hood
But that might not be a bad way to go about it.
