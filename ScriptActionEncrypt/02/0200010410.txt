...You're meeting back up with the Archer of Shinjuku, correct? Shall we get moving?
[k]

[charaFace F 5]
＠Altria Alter
I must see him again. Depending on the circumstances, we may even have to cross swords again.
[k]

？1：Please try to keep it peaceful...

[charaFace F 0]
＠Altria Alter
I understand. But I hope you also understand your situation here, [%1].
[k]

？2：It won't come to that. Don't worry.

[charaFace F 4]
＠Altria Alter
[%1]... You really are far too trusting.
[k]

？！

[charaFace F 5]
＠Altria Alter
Shinjuku as it is now is a city of lies. The ones you love may kill you; those you hate may save you.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
All in service of survival.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
Hellish though this Singularity may be, when it comes to that, both human and Servant alike are desperate.
[k]

＠Altria Alter
As such...there is no guarantee that he will not betray you.

On top of that, it kept adding expansion after expansion, making it almost impossible to navigate! And that's even with a map!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And since the east and west exits aren't connected, going out the wrong one means starting over again!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Before you know it, you've arrived at a station on a different line and then have to double back!

＠Da Vinci
If you go up the stairs to try and catch your breath, you find yourself at the bus terminal!

If you try to read directions in an app, it'll have you follow a route straight through a store wall!

[charaFace C 0]
＠Da Vinci
Still, we don't have any choice but to go. We'll try to narrow down Archer's location as much as we can.

I'll handle the adjustments. Mash needs a break, and I think you could use some sleep too, Master.
