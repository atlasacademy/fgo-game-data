＠Musashi
Thanks for filling me in.[sr]I think I've got the lay of the land now.
[k]

＠Musashi
So basically, you don't know where you are,[sr]or how you got here.
[k]

＠Musashi
Usually you've got a thing that lets you talk to your comrades, but for some reason, you can't do that now.
[k]

＠Musashi
And to top it all off, you can't be totally sure[sr]that this isn't all a dream. That about it?
[k]

？1：I think it might have happened before, so...
？2：It's just like the first time we met.

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Musashi
Oh, back on Onigashima. I've actually crossed a few[sr]more worlds since then, but never mind that now.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
Did you get over your dizzy spells?[sr]Okay. I can trust your story, then.
[k]

＠Musashi
The last thing you remember, you were still in your own worl[line 2]back in Chaldea[line 2]and bam! Next thing you know, you're waking up here.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Musashi
I can't say for sure whether you're dreaming or not...
[k]

＠Musashi
But I have heard stories about people's spirits leaving their bodies while they dream.
[k]

＠Musashi
Some puppeteer with glasses once told me that while it was extremely rare to travel to other worlds while dreaming, it does happen occasionally...
[k]

？1：I...see...
？2：Something like that is going on with Shiki...

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
...At any rate, even I'm surprised by how[sr]far off the beaten path your life takes you.
[k]

？1：You think?
？2：I guess?

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Musashi
Sure! It makes me feel closer to you than ever before! It's great to finally have someone to talk to who really gets me!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
And since we have so much in common, I'll be glad[sr]to help make sure you wake up from this dream safely.
[k]

＠Musashi
My best guess, you probably ARE dreaming. But at the same time, this world also really exists. At least, I think it does.
[k]

＠Musashi
So if you end up dying here before you wake up,[sr]you'll probably end up dead for real.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Musashi
I've seen people die to...curses?[sr]Seen stuff like that more than a few times.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
So as Musashi-no-Kami, I hereby offer to serve[sr]as your guard until this thing blows over!
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Musashi
Haha, it's been so long since I've said something like that! Makes me feel kinda silly!
[k]

＠Musashi
Somebody even trusted a ruffian like me to look after a plot of land once, if you can believe that!
[k]

＠Musashi
Don't worry, I've protected a fair few over the years,[sr]so just relax and let me handle everything!
[k]

＠Musashi
In fact, to be honest, I just came here a day ago myself, so I've been a little nervous about exploring this place on my own.
[k]

？1：You mean you got lost and ended up here too...?
？2：So...we're both in the same boat...?

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
Yup! Though I'm not nearly as out of place as you are. The air's kinda different here, but this is still the Japan[sr]I know.
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Musashi
That said, I'm afraid I don't know anything more about what's going on than you do! Sorry about that.
[k]

＠Musashi
I've bounced around all kindsa worlds, but it seems[sr]I can't go back to worlds I've been to before.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
I'm always getting called “stranger” and “world drifter” and other stuff like that wherever I go, so I'm pretty much always starting from scratch.
[k]

＠Musashi
A lotta the time, I get rough types getting in my face and picking fights and stuff. Sometimes it gets me so riled up I can't control myself.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Musashi
But with you here with me, I'm sure you'll talk me down from doing anything foolish. Lady Kannon must have had a hand in this!
[k]

＠Musashi
I mean, you ended up here just after you were talking about me, right? It must be fate!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
Anyway, I'm glad you're here with me.[sr]Let's find out what's up with this place together.
[k]

＠Musashi
We'll look for a way to get you back to your own world, and a way for me to keep going with my journey.
[k]

[k]

＠Musashi
We've already shared a rice ball before![sr]There's no need for flattery!
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
...Okay, now that we're all caught up,[sr]what say we get moving?
[k]

＠Musashi
From the look of things around here, I can say for sure we're in Japan. I'd guess somewhere in the center of the country?
[k]

＠Musashi
Let's start by seeing what's over in that direction. If we're lucky, we'll find a village. If we're unlucky...well, we should still find a river!

...Well, we've been walking for an hour, and so far the only thing we've found is a buncha Jizou statues.
[k]

＠Musashi
Still, I bet it won't be much longer now until we find a village. Trust me, that's usually how it goes.
[k]

＠Musashi
Oh, are you okay, [%1]? Did you want to take a break? I must have been walking pretty quickly...
[k]

？1：I'm okay. This is nothing compared to America.

＠Musashi
Huh? You mean you've crossed that whole continent!? That's amazing! Even I got tired just crossing the western part of it!
[k]

＠Musashi
Still...you know what America is like, huh.[sr]That country is really huge.
[k]

＠Musashi
Although... Neeheehee. If you can handle that much land, that means you can also handle me dragging you around a kinda rough, right?
[k]

？2：This is nothing compared to Onigashima's mountain pass.

＠Musashi
Well, yeah, compared to a giant mountain like that,[sr]a nice flat rice field like this is no big deal!
[k]

＠Musashi
I mean, there were real oni there! To be honest, I was scared out of my wits the first time I saw one!
[k]

？！

＠Musashi
...Aaanyway, I guess I should save my energy and just hush a bit, huh?
[k]

＠Musashi
So let's take it nice and easy while we walk.[sr]Luckily, the sky is a beautiful blue today.
[k]

＠Musashi
I'm still hungry since I lost my rice ball, but I can make do as long as the sky is nice and blue like this!
[k]

？1：You sure do like blue skies, don't you, Musashi?

＠Musashi
I do. America's sky was beautiful too, but there's just something about it here that I really love.
[k]

＠Musashi
Like it has a kind of depth to it? No, that's not right.[sr]If anything, this sky seems more pliable.
[k]

＠Musashi
America's sky was so pretty you could feel your thoughts emptying out as you looked at it, but not this sky.
[k]

＠Musashi
It feels like it could pull you into it, to a point where it's actually kind of scary. That's one of the things I love about it.
[k]

＠Musashi
I guess part of that has to do with my memories of watching it as a child, though. Ahaha.
[k]

？2：Oh yeah, it was cloudy the last time.

＠Musashi
Come to think of it, it was. I still enjoyed my time on that island, but that part was unfortunate.

Onui, you mentioned Edo, right?[sr]It sounds like it's a major city.

That would put us in the same time period I was in before: during the Tokugawa Shogunate's reign.

＠Onui
Uh huh. If that's where you're headed,[sr]it's just a half day's walk along the highway.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
...That would mean this is Kazusa Province.[sr]So we must be in the eastern part of the country.

No, this is the Shimousa Province.

[charaFace A 0]

[charaFace A 4]

I could have sworn that Toke Castle was in Kazusa, and that it was abandoned during the Toyotomi reign.
[k]

＠Musashi
I don't remember it being big enough to have its own town either.
[k]

＠Musashi
This is all very different than I remember...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Musashi
Say, Onui, Lord Tokugawa is the ruler of Edo, right?
[k]

＠Onui
That's right. His name is Tokugawa Ie... Ie-something...[sr]Oh, Iemitsu! [charaFace B 1]His name is Tokugawa Iemitsu!
[k]

＠B：Tasuke
Ga, ga!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
[charaFace A 4]

＠Musashi
So this is Iemitsu's reign... Even so, Toke Castle should still be in Kazusa, and still be abandoned to boot... Hmm, maybe this is part of that.

At any rate, this is good. We now know that this is the Tokugawa reign under Tokugawa Iemitsu, and that we're somewhere in the Shimousa Province.
