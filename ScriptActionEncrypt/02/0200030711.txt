＠Fuuma Kotarou
Samurai who have devoted themselves to the politics of the imperial court and have come to neglect their training are no match for us.

The reason we refer to them as hooligans[sr]isn't because we despise them.

It's because compared to a swordsman, ninja are no better than the bales of straw they use for practice.
