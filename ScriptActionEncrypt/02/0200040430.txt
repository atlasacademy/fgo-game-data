＠Mrs. Pickman
The [%1] Company's Sanson saved my daughter's life.
[k]

＠Mrs. Pickman
That alone should prove that they are good, upstanding people, with boundless love in their hearts.

What was that, Mrs. Pickman?

It sounded like you just told us this man practiced medicine without a license from the governor.

＠Hopkins
Yes, I did. I admit to that.
[k]

＠Hopkins
However, according to another villager's allegations, Sanson left behind a prescription at the Pickmans' house.
[k]

＠Hopkins
A scrap of this prescription has been admitted as evidence. Practicing medicine without a medical license is a grave and serious crime.
[k]

？1：That's just groundless nitpicking!
？2：That has nothing to do with ANY of this!

It's not my fault your daughter has always been sickly!

I even told you that you should have Sanson treat her, and you refused to listen!

Your Honor, I can vouch for Sanson as well.
[k]

＠Elder Pickman
My granddaughter wouldn't be alive today without him.[sr]He's a great man with talents beyond any mere actor.

If anyone is at fault here,[sr]it is me for inviting him into our house.

＠Hopkins
Shout and weep all you like, but justice cannot be moved by such petty concerns. Nor shall I.
[k]

＠Hopkins
All I require of you is the truth. I will determine with my own learned, neutral eyes who is, and who is not a witch!
[k]

＠Hopkins
For often does the devil appear before those in crisis, in a form most sweet and beguiling, offering their heart's desire.
[k]

＠Hopkins
In the end, traveling performers are no more than drifters.
[k]

＠Hopkins
All is well so long as things go the way they wish, but at the first sign of trouble, they disappear like so much smoke.
[k]

＠Hopkins
This man has the gall to be both actor and doctor how and when it suits him. He is nothing like a true doctor, who has to earn his patients' trust.
[k]

＠Hopkins
As for this “actress,” it seems that once the curtain falls, she plies her true trade: harlotry.
[k]

？1：Everyone heals in different ways.

＠Hopkins
...Indeed.
[k]

＠Hopkins
So too are sins innumerable and varied, which is why the law seeks to judge them fairly and justly.
[k]

？2：Didn't the Son of God bless a prostitute too?

＠Hopkins
Only one who had repented for her ways. I will not have you interpreting the Bible to suit your own ends.
[k]

＠Hopkins
As you'll recall, once that sinful woman had repented, the Son of God drove out seven evil spirits from her before offering His blessing.
[k]

＠Hopkins
However...
[k]

？！

＠Hopkins
...is Mata Hari capable of such a thing?
[k]

＠Hopkins
Or is she instead a wretched, wicked woman who lowers men's guards, betrays them, lures them to adultery...
[k]

＠Hopkins
...and freely wields the seven vices in order to ensnare her targets? In other words...a witch?
[k]

＠Hopkins
Those who have fallen for such a trap inevitably seek companions with whom they might lessen their guilt...
[k]

＠Hopkins
...As for you, Mrs. Pickman.
[k]

＠Hopkins
I see that I must also put you to the question when this trial is concluded.
[k]

＠Hopkins
Depending on your answers, we may need to continue these proceedings...

Mata Hari...[sr]Indeed, she is nothing less than a prodigy.

Her outstanding record proves it beyond any doubt.

＠Critic
Her technique may be shoddy, her misguided passion delusional, and her makeup garish...
[k]

＠Critic
...yet she consistently walks a line that weaves them all together into a show you simply can't look away from.

＠Critic
Hmm... That said...

Oh yes, I've been to see her shows countless times! I don't even know how many bouquets and presents I've sent her.

Hahaha, of course, I don't expect anything from her in return. That is what it means to be a patron!
[k]

＠Theater Patron
Hmm. Still, lately, I suppose there have been a lot of...new faces at her shows?
[k]

＠Theater Patron
I can't deny that I've been less willing to attend after so many French generals started showing up.
[k]

＠Theater Patron
They don't offer money, but given the current circumstances, they're good at exerting their influence in other ways.
[k]

＠Theater Patron
If Mata Hari were to ever mistake that for her own power, well...that would be most unfortunate.
