...[se ad534][seVolume ad534 0 0.4][wt 0.3][seStop ad534 0.2]Now, let's address her next sin. In the second[sr]Salem, I inadvertently allowed Chaldea to enter.
[k]

＠Carter
It was an act of interference I never foresaw, stemming from a single one of their observational instruments...
[k]

＠Carter
Flauros's Near-Future Observation Lens, Sheba. A highly advanced hybrid of science and magecraft capable of acquiring highly detailed visual data.
[k]

＠Carter
When the Demon God Pillars acted contrary to Goetia's expectations, it was able to observe and restrain them.
[k]

＠Carter
A detestable feature that was equal parts safety and liability. And, as if to prove that point, it scrounged up what little intelligence it had, and then had the temerity to act of its own accord...
[k]

＠Carter
...summoning a Heroic Spirit and sending it to this very land.
[k]

＠Carter
Apparently, the Queen of Sheba was the only human Goetia ever trusted.
[k]

＠Carter
What a disgusting display of sentiment.[sr]How anyone could feel such things is beyond me.
[k]

＠Carter
At any rate, Sheba detected the surviving Demon God Pillar, and alerted Chaldea.
[k]

＠Carter
Then it overloaded the Heroic Spirit Summoning System, and used itself as a catalyst to send a single Heroic Spirit into Salem.
[k]

＠Carter
I will admit, it was a quick and expeditious act.
[k]

＠Carter
At that point, the Salem phenomenon had devoured the magical energy of the fifty thousand people inside, and was proceeding at 105,000 times normal speed.
[k]

＠Carter
This Heroic Spirit's interference caused it to slow down dramatically.
[k]

＠Carter
However, doing so exhausted the Heroic Spirit, and the potency of her abilities was greatly reduced.
[k]

＠Carter
Ah yes, that reminds me. Whatever happened to the real Tituba, Abigail?

[k]

＠Carter
...[se ad534][seVolume ad534 0 0.4][wt 0.3][seStop ad534 0.2]Let us now address her third sin.
[k]

＠Carter
Although the Heroic Spirit had been rendered nearly powerless, slowing down time had a hugely detrimental effect on the tests' efficiency.
[k]

＠Carter
And I had already used up the fifth Salem.
[k]

＠Carter
With time and magical energy running out, I began to grow reckless.
[k]

＠Carter
It was then that I asked you for advice.[sr]What was it you said to me?
