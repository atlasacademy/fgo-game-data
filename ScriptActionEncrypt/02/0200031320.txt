In fact, I kind of admire that unflappable nature of yours. If you weren't a swordsman, I'd have taken you in as my apprentice.

...and that it was an important part of their plans, or something to that effect. Maybe they're planning to use it to establish a new land of demons?

If Onui and Tasuke are going to grow up happy here, we[sr]can't leave things like this. [charaFace A 0]Not even with lunch on the line.

They're tied up in the stable 'round the back. Take them. Ride to the castle. Just don't touch the chestnut one. He's mine.
