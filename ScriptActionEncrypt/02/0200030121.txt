＠Musashi
“Unparalleled with the spear” doesn't come close to doing your skill justice. It would even be an insult to call you “the greatest of all time.”
[k]

＠Musashi
Every thrust of your spear[line 2]every sweep, every strike, every slash[line 2]would be ultimate finishing blows for any other fighter.
[k]

＠Musashi
...To be honest, watching you fight up close gave me chills. It was so beautiful I could hardly believe it.
[k]

＠Musashi
No one, at any point in Japan's history, has ever wielded a spear with such absolute perfection.
[k]

＠Musashi
The depth of your mindfulness and technique... The way your spear cut through the air with only the bare minimum distance required... The sheer mastery of your form, with not a single movement wasted... I still have a long way to go in comparison.

Incredible. You win, no doubt about it. It has been an honor to witness your skill up close, Lord Inshun.

I have no idea whether or not I have a Master. All I know is that when I came to, I was standing alone at the edge of the Katori Shrine grounds.

Nonetheless, when I came to, I had an ominous premonition. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, warning me not to remain a moment longer.
