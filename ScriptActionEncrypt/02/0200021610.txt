At least right now, we're still above the relatively uninhabited Nepalese mountains...but there's still got to be at least some people seeing this.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
These last few minutes alone are going to be a nightmare for the Mage's Association of this time period to clean up.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And if that weren't enough, you're also going to drop this huge landmass on a heavily populated city?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]
＠Da Vinci
This is a disaster.[sr]It would be a catastrophe like we've never seen before.
[k]

？1：Hundreds... Thousands of people would die!

I'm afraid it could be orders of magnitude greater than that. To make matters worse, the damage won't be limited to the physical realm.

We're still experiencing the aftereffects of the Goetia mess, so the world hasn't completely stabilized yet.

Everyone will know that mystical beings exist, and in consequence, everyone will attempt to learn their secrets for themselves.

If it isn't death you fear, but the idea of yourself dying...then something has gone wrong in your life.

...Let me share now what I held back that night: our perspectives on death couldn't be more different.
[k]

＠Fergus
I am a warrior. From the day I was born, I have been taught that to die is an honor.
[k]

＠Fergus
The only aspect of death we fear is that we might die having violated our pride or geis, not death itself.
[k]

＠Fergus
Death is inevitable for all living things.[sr]The path you take to death IS your life.

＠Scheherazade
I don't want to be strangled.[sr]I don't want to be cut. I don't want to be flogged.

That's right, Master. I know the story of the One Thousand and One Nights...the Arabian Nights as well.

In it, there was a king who was taking virgins as wives and killing them the next morning.

And you volunteered to go and stop him because it was the right thing to do. Didn't you?

But...do you know what it's like to spend night after night with a deranged king who no longer trusts women?
[k]

＠Scheherazade
The fear that comes with never knowing if the next day will be your last?
[k]

＠Scheherazade
He couldn't be reasoned with or bargained with.[sr]He would simply kill women for no reason at all.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]
＠Scheherazade
I could have been killed merely because the wind blew. Or because it rained.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Anything could have set him off.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
And of course...it was always possible that he would grow tired of my stories, and decide to kill me rather than wait to find out what happens next.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
It was as though I lived with a poisonous insect who could kill me with but a single sting.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
That is why, after some time, all I had left was the desire to not die.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
That was all I had.[sr]I devoted my entire being towards fulfilling it.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
Words. Expressions. Presence. Gaze. Servitude. Demeanor. Opinions. Changes. Worldview. Stories. Pleasure. Temperature. Uselessness. Usefulness. Submissiveness. Stimulation.
[k]

＠Scheherazade
I gave up everything I had, all so I wouldn't have to die.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]
＠Scheherazade
And at long last...after one thousand interminable nights, the king finally came to his senses...!
[k]

＠Scheherazade
After all that, when I had lived my one and only life...[sr]I was forced to become a Heroic Spirit!
[k]

＠Scheherazade
After I had been shaped and formed solely by my desire not to die, I went and became a being that is doomed to be repeatedly summoned and always disappear!

...Kings are both great in stature, and foolish in mind. Agartha itself has proven as much.
[k]

＠Fergus
A single person attempting to lead a nation will inevitably end in discord.
[k]

＠Fergus
Regardless of whether that discord leads to failure among its people, or failure in the nation itself...
[k]

＠Fergus
I know now that the responsibility for either outcome falls on the king. From the outside, that king will appear foolish, or even tyrannical.
[k]

＠Fergus
No matter how skilled a warrior they are, kings who cannot accept that foolishness will not stay king.
[k]

＠Fergus
...My future self knows that well.
[k]

＠Fergus
Nothing I can say to you could make up for the suffering you endured, spending a thousand nights with such a foolish king.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]
＠Fergus
But I can say this:
[k]

＠Fergus
I won't let you destroy the world simply because you don't want to die.
