Or, to be more precise, I've accumulated so much evidence so quickly that I've only now reached a point where I CAN interject.

I do of course understand that there is no need for me to involve myself in this matter, but given my nature, I'm afraid I'm compelled to do so regardless.

Now then...Ms. Kyrielight. I see you have your brow furrowed with quite a sweat.

Would you care to elaborate on the mystery that still plagues you?

That will explain how this whole matter began, and, most likely, how it will end.

But we still haven't found the Demon God Pillar, even though we know it's somewhere here in Agartha.

＠Holmes
Precisely. To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed. The evidence is so clear that it practically leads you to the conclusion by the nose.
[k]

＠Holmes
Nonetheless, since I know you to be something of a fan of mine, Ms. Kyrielight, I shall take this occasion to repeat one of my best-known lines:
[k]

＠Holmes
“Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.”
[k]

＠Holmes
In this case, the “impossible” is the notion that the Demon God Pillar could not have been hiding within one of the leaders of the three nations in Agartha.
[k]

＠Holmes
That its signal remains even after defeating all prior suspects proves that none of them were the culprit.
[k]

＠Holmes
We can safely eliminate Chaldea's Servants from the pool of suspects as well. While not impossible for the Pillar to have hidden within one of them, doing so would have been needlessly complicated.
[k]

＠Holmes
Now, it seems fair to assume that the Servants you met in Agartha who originated from Chaldea were forcefully summoned here to serve specific roles.
[k]

＠Holmes
While they may have functioned as hooks and page-turners to propel one through the story, they are highly unlikely to be part of the main cast.
[k]

＠Holmes
So...given all that, what is it that “remains”?
[k]

＠Holmes
Who is the one surviving Servant we have met here in Agartha that has no relation whatsoever to Chaldea?
[k]
