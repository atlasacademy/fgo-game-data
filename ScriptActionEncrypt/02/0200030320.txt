＠Musashi
...For the moment, let's try making a break for the village.
[k]

＠Musashi
We don't know what that thing that looks like Lord Inshun is made out of, so we can't be sure it won't be able to follow us in there.
[k]

＠Musashi
Still, it's the only option we have right now.[sr]At least, it's the only one I can think of.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Musashi
I'm so tired of those things getting in our way.
[k]

？1：You said it.
？2：I wish they'd leave us alone already!

？！

[charaFace A 5]

＠Musashi
Seriously![sr]Can't we catch a single break!?

＠Musashi
We're kinda in a hurry here.[sr]And on top of that, I'm still kinda pissed.
[k]

＠Musashi
...You might be too, if you'd just had one of your strongest blows laughed off as a practice swing.
[k]

＠Musashi
I'm not ashamed to run away, but I've got my pride as a swordsman, and that really sucked!
[k]

＠Musashi
I'm not gonna try to contain my anger,[sr]or listen to anything you might have to say!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Musashi
Right now, I'm as angry and annoyed as you are.[sr]Don't expect me to hold back while I cut my way through!
