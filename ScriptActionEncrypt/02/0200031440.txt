＠Fuuma Kotarou
Abe-no-Seimei. Guardian of Kyoto, and a genius among the onmyouji.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
He was a legend. The highest rank of astrologers and a master of yin and yang techniques. It's said he even knew secret spells that could bring the dead back to life.
[k]

＠Fuuma Kotarou
It's also said that a man with that True Name defeated the white-faced nine-tailed fox, one of the three great monsters that threatened all of Japan.

＠Fuuma Kotarou
Some stories say he was a superhuman born to a fox, who went on to live an exceptionally long life. It makes sense that a person like that would leave his mark on humanity as a Heroic Spirit, but...
