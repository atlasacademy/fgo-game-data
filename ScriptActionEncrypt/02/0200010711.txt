＠Archer of Shinjuku
Now do you understand, [%1]?[sr]That Berserker is turning people into puppets.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
First he strips them of their skin, then he removes their bones, leaving only some muscle and nerves, which he then packs inside an empty mannequin.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
When he's done, he has a new autonomous marionette[line 2]one that sings, no less. This leaves us with two questions.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
First, what is his goal in doing this?[sr]And second, is it possible to save these puppets?
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
For the first question... Ordinarily, one would think that humans move better than puppets.
[k]


[charaFace B 4]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
However, now that I have dismantled this one, I can see that this is not the case.

＠Da Vinci
This is most likely based on loathing and fastidiousness.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Loathing of the human form, and fastidiousness in thinking of non-human humans as beautiful.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
These two things overlap, and as a result, him creating these things is nothing but a mere hobby.
[k]

？1：A hobby...?

＠Da Vinci
Yes, a hobby. He doesn't create these things because he needs them to fight for him.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He simply creates them because he finds them beautiful.

There's no sense expecting such a thing from a Berserker. Especially not one quite so mad as him.
[k]

？！

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Now, as to the second question:[sr]is it possible to save these people?
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
No. Once someone has been turned into a puppet, they'll remain a puppet until their death.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
For starters, the process of making them into puppets shatters their minds beyond repair. They're not alive; they are being preserved in an undead state.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
What hope of rescue could there be for them once they've seen their very bodies disassembled?
[k]


＠Archer of Shinjuku
No, they are very much dead and broken. A horrific crime, but since they are already beyond hope...
[k]


[charaFace B 1]

It will wreak havoc among the puppets, and give us a chance to assassinate their queen.

There's also a saying in the medical community about how poison in small doses can be a remedy.

＠Da Vinci
It's the same principle that gave us penicillin from blue mold and anticoagulation meds from leeches.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
For that matter, vaccines are nothing more than poison administered in small enough doses to trigger the body's defenses, giving it protection against stronger poisons.
