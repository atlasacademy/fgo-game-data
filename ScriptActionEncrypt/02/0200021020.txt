Now that I think about it, the Amazons were the first opponents I fought down here. ...Eh? The Demon Boar? No no, that doesn't count.

Between Ys and the Nightless City, I thought I had gone through some decent training and grown at least a little since that first fight.

But I guess not. I'm still young and weak, and cannot raise my sword against a woman.

I suppose it's no surprise given that we are in the heart of their territory, but there certainly are a fair number of Amazons around.

It is now a nation of warriors led by a single queen. There is no gap between rich and poor, and no distinction in class apart from warrior and royalty.
