＠Musashi
That's right. Muramasa. Heard the name before, Onui?[sr]The bane of Tokugawa?
[k]

＠Musashi
Muramasa is a legendary swordsmith from Kuwana, in Ise Province. He's famous for forging cursed katanas that have wreaked devastation on the Tokugawa family.
[k]

＠Musashi
He's said to have forged the katana that slew Tokugawa Ieyasu's grandfather, the one used to assist Ieyasu's eldest son, Nobuyasu, in performing seppuku, and even a shoto that injured Ieyasu himself.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Musashi
Basically, any sword bearing the name Muramasa is feared far and wide for the threat it poses to the Tokugawa family!
[k]

？1：Legendary katana...
？2：The name “Muramasa” DOES sound kind of familiar.

？！

[charaFace B 0]

＠Musashi
Specifically, they refer to katana that have been[sr]forged by the Muramasa school of swordsmithing.
[k]

＠Musashi
Since you call yourself Senji Muramasa, you must be a disciple of that school... Or maybe even its founder.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Onui
Founder?

After all, I'm a Servant. I ain't got the least notion of whether this idea even belonged to the original Muramasa or not.

[charaFace C 8]

＠Senji Muramasa
I'm just a swordsmith. I never did nothin'[sr]to make me worthy of becoming a Heroic Spirit.

[charaFace C 1]

＠Senji Muramasa
Well, I will say that my smithing skills are on par with the gods. But the problem is my accomplishments.

[charaFace C 0]

＠Senji Muramasa
I never slew a hundred men,[sr]never saved a nation, yadda yadda.

＠Senji Muramasa
So I never quite made the cut for getting a[sr]Spirit Origin worthy of being a Heroic Spirit.

＠Senji Muramasa
That I somehow ended up in some damn situation where some fool needed my help anyway must mean the gods saw fit to give me a chance.

Ugh, what a damn pain. If I'm a Saber, then why'd I end up here in this workshop with these skills? Don't make a lick of sense!
[k]

？1：I wonder if this is a magecraft workshop then.
？2：Maybe it's acting as a kind of barrier?

？！

It's just a smithy. A place for a smith to swing his hammer. Even if it does have something extra stuck to it, at base that's all it is.

＠Senji Muramasa
When I first came to about a month or so ago,[sr]I was already here in Shimousa, all alone.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
And no sooner had I woken up than I saw a group of those dark spirit creatures not far off. I take it you've seen them by now?
[k]

？1：Maybe they're dark warrior spirits or something?

＠Senji Muramasa
I have heard things like that have been showing up as of late. Back in my time, ghosts were more of a regular occurrence.

＠Senji Muramasa
[&Attaboy:Attagirl].[sr]Got it in one.

[charaFace C 7]

＠Senji Muramasa
I materialized during the day, in the middle of a rice field not too far from here. There were a number of people out working in the field when I got there...
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
...but those creatures had already killed about half of them. Including Onui and Tasuke's parents.

Hardly. I'm just another visitor. We Heroic Spirits are still technically dead; I ain't about to get hip deep into other folk's problems.

＠Musashi

[k]

＠Musashi
I just thought you'd been here a long time because you get along so well with Onui and Tasuke, and you seem like you're very at home.

＠Musashi
That goes for this smithy too.[sr]It feels like it's a part of you.

Now, where was I...[charaFace C 0][sr]Oh yeah, the creatures.

I think Onui said they don't come to villages?

I can understand why she'd think that. Not quite right, though. They avoid the temples and shrines, not villages.

So they avoid places of worship, huh... How well-mannered of them. Though I guess that makes sense when you think about it.[charaFace B 12]

[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
Heard there's more than one of 'em, too,[sr]not counting the one you killed last night.
[k]

＠Musashi
Yes, that's right.[sr]Six others.

[charaFace C 8]

[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Musashi
More?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Senji Muramasa
Not long after the creatures first showed up, peddlers were full to bursting with rumors of them, and soon enough just about everyone had heard about the new threat.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
They said a suspicious-looking man was practicing dark Jesuit sorcery on the grounds of Katori Shrine.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
That his mysticism turned day to night in an instant, and six powerful knights clawed their way up from the depths of hell to serve him.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
These knights are called the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters, and they are monsters hell-bent on laying waste to the world of man...or so the rumors go.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
Sounded like a buncha hogwash to me. At first, anyway. Now I get that they're real, and wreaking havoc and destruction in all manner of places.
[k]

＠Senji Muramasa
I've even heard that they razed the Hitachi Province so completely that nobody can bear to look at it now.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Musashi
...That's the province north of Shimousa.[sr]What exactly did they do to Hitachi?
[k]
