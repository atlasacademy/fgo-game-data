＠Caster of Limbo
...That's right.[sr]Purgatorio has vanished.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
Please accept my humblest apologies. This unfortunate accident is the result of my ritual being incomplete.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
However, I am pleased to say that as the seventh and final sacrifice, Purgatorio was successful in fulfilling his role.

Don't give us that nonsense, Caster.

How could you possibly claim he fulfilled his role?[sr]His jumonji spear did not even claim a hundred lives.

＠Sorcerer
No matter. He shall still serve as an excellent cornerstone for Onriedo.
[k]

＠Sorcerer
Don't be so hasty, Empireo. And Limbo, this system is hardly different from the Holy Grail War you told me of.
[k]

＠Sorcerer
The souls of all Heroic Spirit Swordmasters who meet their end shall simply come to reside within the foundations of my Onriedo.

＠Caster of Limbo
You are absolutely correct, Lord Sorcerer.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
Nonetheless...Lord Empireo is also correct.[sr]It WOULD be to our advantage to have more sacrifices.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
The souls of a few mere Heroic Spirits will not be sufficient for Onriedo to completely manifest.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
And we cannot have that.[sr]Thus, the more we kill...the better.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
The more we kill, the more it shall grow.[sr]Resentment of the killer... Envy of the survivors...
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
Grief at the thought of losing your own life,[sr]and the lives of those you love... Mmm...
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
The more souls there are drenched in bitterness,[sr]envy, and grief, the better it will be for us!

＠Caster of Limbo
Ordinary Heroic Spirits will not suffice.[sr]Ordinary knights will not suffice.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
But now that they harbor the Curse of Annihilation thanks to my secret technique and your own power, they shall slaughter all living things.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
They shall kill, and kill, and kill, right up[sr]until they wear themselves out and die off.
[k]

＠Caster of Limbo
They shall offer up many, many sacrifices, as they work to finally bring the world of humans to an end.

Naturally. We're all imbued with masses of pure evil aura writhing around inside us, after all. Tell me,[sr]Lord Sorcerer, who is this man?

＠Berserker of Saṃghāta Hell
You don't seem to be a Heroic Spirit,[sr]and you stink of dirt something fierce.

You're right, little oni. I'm just a hermit who lives up in the mountains, subsisting on grass and plants, while you all seem to be nobles and samurai.

No need to concern yourselves with my guest. I ran into this vagabond in the mountains of Hitachi and brought him back with me on a whim.

You all have your own roles to play. While I don't require protection, I have decided it would be a good idea to keep a meat shield around, just in case.

Peace, Saṃghāta Hell. Sheathe your claws.[sr]Ignore him. Pretend he is not even here.

Now, no more idle chatter. You will set[sr]about fulfilling your assignments at once.
[k]

＠Sorcerer
Go forth and kill, my Heroic Spirit Swordmasters. As the dawning sun brings an end to the night, you shall bring an end to this world of false peace.

I shall now prepare for the arrival of Onriedo.[sr]The rest is in your hands now.
