Everyone says that monsters almost never show up near the town, so people here don't take them seriously.

[charaFace C 12]

＠Musashi
It could also be that the castle is controlling what sort of information makes its way into town, not that I've got any evidence for that theory!
[k]

＠Musashi
Then again, maybe they're actually working in secret to gather intelligence on the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters and their summoner.
