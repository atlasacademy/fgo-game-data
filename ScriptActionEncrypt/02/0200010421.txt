[charaFadeout F 0.1]

[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 0]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Very well, shall we start at the beginning? Grand. Firstly, your sword was something of a giveaway as to your being a Saber.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
However, It is theoretically possible that you could have been a Rider or Berserker...
[k]


＠Archer of Shinjuku
But the odds of a Rider using a motorcycle for a mount seem vanishingly small.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Of course, the motorcycle could have been your Noble Phantasm, but then it would hardly make sense for you to fight with that sword.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
And given your finesse while mounted, and your eloquence, we can safely rule out the possibility of you being a Berserker.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
The fact that you fought my other self and survived also indicates that you are a highly skilled Saber.
[k]


[charaFace B 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
However, your apparent age is something of an anomaly for a Saber.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Generally, such a Servant would be summoned in her twenties[line 2]her prime.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
And yet you look a deal younger than that.[sr]Unnaturally young, one might say.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
This could only mean that at some point in your life, before you became a hero, you ceased aging.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
You speak standard English without an accent. However, such knowledge would have been given to you by the Throne of Heroes, so this is hardly helpful.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
That you are a woman is something of a complication. There are, after all, few female knights who made a lasting name in history. Of course, magecraft would enable you to disguise yourself as male.
[k]


＠Archer of Shinjuku
Unfortunately, of the small number of female knights who did leave their mark on history, most would appear a bit older when summoned than you do now.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Jeanne d'Arc was an exception, beginning at seventeen and dying at nineteen...
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
But she was an amateur with the sword[line 2]something which you clearly are not.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
And so I was forced to assume that you were believed to be a man by those who came after you to record your legend.
[k]


[charaFace B 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
There is also your brazen attitude and kingly mien that you've demonstrated since we met.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
When we take this alongside what we already know[line 2]namely that you are a famous, ageless male knight of Western lore[line 2]the answer was quite simple.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
For the sake of discussion, let us say that you were Arthur Pendragon. That would certainly explain your royal bearing and comportment.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
But even if you were once known as Arthur, it is very unlikely to be your True Name.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
So we arrive at Altria, a corruption of the feminine form of Artorius. And if there was ever a Saber who could be called corrupted, it would be you, would it not?

As such, the only sensible conclusion is that she was somehow inverted... In other words, an Alter.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
After all, were that not the case, it would be far too difficult to survive in this hellish world.

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Even for one as pure and wholesome as King Arthur himself.

[charaFace B 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
This makes it all but a foregone conclusion that she is, in fact, an Alter.

＠Archer of Shinjuku
And, well, I if I am wrong about all of this, that is all right. I don't mind looking the fool.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Of course, if I am correct, you will all surely stand in awe of my deductive skills!

[charaFace B 0]

And so you see the process that led me to deduce your identity. How did I do?

However, Mash Kyrielight...

It is because he used that skill and reasoning for evil that he stands before you as a Servant now.

...I knew there were two of them, but I didn't think they were split into good and evil.

I'm surprised he had even a modicum of anything that one could call a conscience.

At any rate, if this is the case, the problem is even thornier than I thought.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
That building's form is already fairly visible.[sr]I believe I know its role as well.
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
The problem comes down to the following three points: Where does the ammunition come from?
[k]

＠Edmond Dantès
Is it even possible? And why would he do that?

[charaFace G 4]
＠Edmond Dantès
In a sense, I'm impressed there is still so much I can't see even after coming all this way, Archer.
