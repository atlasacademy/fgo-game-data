Even with the Golden Jade Ring sealed away, the Single Horned Rhinoceros King was a fearsome opponent!

After a long and intense battle, Crown Prince Nezha and Sun Wukong finally managed to subdue him.

And, as befits a disciple of Sanzang, Sun Wukong did not take his opponent's life after he admitted defeat.

＠Mash (Narrator)
Thus were Sanzang and her disciples finally freed from the tower's kitchen...
