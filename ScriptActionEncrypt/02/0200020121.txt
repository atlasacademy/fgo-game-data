Okay, let's see where those beasties' tracks lead...[sr]I wonder if there'll be any people?

[charaFace B 1]

Hehe, thanks, Master![sr]It's nice to be trusted!

Hey, looky-looky! That was fast! Isn't that a guy there on the ground, over by that boulder?

The beasts' tracks continue on past that point.[sr]It seems unlikely to be a coincidence.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Perhaps this man was unwittingly caught up in their stampede, and fled there for shelter.

＠???
I...think I'm ok. Thank you.
[k]

＠???
Just the fact that you bothered to ask tells me you're good people. I'm glad to have met you.

＠d'Eon
I was going to ask if you live down here...but if you are a Servant, it seems there would be little point in doing so.
[k]

＠d'Eon
So instead, let me ask you this: do you know much about this underground world?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠???
No, I don't. All I know is that I was summoned here.
[k]

＠???
I know that I'm a Servant,[sr]but that's really about all I know.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]
＠???
Did you say “underground world”?[sr]That explains why I can't see the sky.
[k]

＠???
Still, I don't get why a fledgling like me would be summoned here in the first place.

Are you? A fledgling, I mean.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠???
I'm afraid so. The whole reason you found me collapsed on the ground like that...
[k]

＠???
...is because I was helpless against those Demonic Beasts that came stampeding out of nowhere.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠???
I wonder if those were the Demonic Boars they say every Celtic warrior should fight at least once in their lives. If so, I can die without any regrets now...

Something like that. We're helping those guys out from behind the scenes. Don't worry, you can trust us.

Now, let me see this Spirit Origin pattern for myself...[sr][charaFace D 5]Oh? Oh!?

That IS interesting. I can see why Mash is at a loss.

You're all good people, so I believe I can trust you.
[k]

＠???
This unshakeable trust I feel must come from another, different version of me having met you before.
[k]

？1：Maybe.
？2：Maybe?

[charaFace E 1]
＠???
I'm sure of it.
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 0]
＠???
...I apologize for asking this out of nowhere, but would you mind if I joined you?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠???
To be honest, I still have a long way to go to become a full-fledged warrior.
[k]

＠???
I can't promise I'll be of much help, but I can promise I won't get in your way.
[k]

[charaFace E 3]
＠???
...I believe the way my heart is racing right now means going with you is the right thing for me to do.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠???
Of course, I'm aware that that alone won't merit your trust, so as a sign of good faith, I'll tell you my True Name.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠???
I'm Fergus mac Róich, a member of the Ulster royal family.
