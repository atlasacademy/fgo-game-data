I can still hardly believe Assassin did something so...horrible.
[k]

＠Rider
I'm glad that the pirates are gone, of course, but did she have to sink the entire city of Ys to do it?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Rider
Who knows what we could have done with the place were it still around... What a waste.
[k]

？1：Like...make it into a tourist attraction?
？2：Like...make it into a water park?

？！

[charaFace E 1]
＠Rider
Haha, I like that. Here I am focused on the present, and you're dreaming up plans for the distant future.
[k]

＠Rider
That's a precious talent in its own right.

Yes, that's one of Senpai's best qualities. No matter how dire things may be, [&he:she] never fails to examine things at new and unusual angles!

To give my own earnest answer... If Ys was still around, then yes, perhaps we could have made use of it as a marine headquarters of sorts.
[k]

＠d'Eon
I believe you said before that that lake is connected to nearly every river that flows across Agartha?
[k]

＠d'Eon
Given the incredible potential in what could have been transported over water as opposed to land, I cannot help but feel that destruction was a waste...

Still, there's no use crying over spilt milk.[sr]Or a sunken city, as the case may be.
[k]

＠Rider
I've already told my Resistance allies to explore the ruins of Ys. They should find several seaworthy vessels.
[k]

＠Rider
What's more, now that the pirates no longer control the waterways, we're on equal ground with our enemies.

Rider's optimism is well-founded.[sr]The situation has certainly taken a turn for the better.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
After all, we've narrowed our pool of Demon God Pillar candidates from three to two.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And we've reduced the number of powers in Agartha. It seems like things should be a good deal easier from now on, don't you think?

[charaFace E 6]
＠Rider
Plenty of other threats remain, like those monsters that attacked our hideout.
[k]

＠Rider
And while I didn't mention this before, there's even a natural disaster of a sort to worry about. We can't go resting easy just because the pirates are gone.

Natural disaster? You mean like earthquakes? That IS a scary thought, especially down underground. I'd hate to be buried alive!

＠Rider
Depending on the situation, I'm afraid it could be even more dangerous than that. You'll just have to see what I mean for yourselves.
[k]

＠Rider
Words alone won't really suffice to describe it.
[k]

＠Rider
There's no telling when it might show up, and should you attempt to spot it yourself, it disappears without a trace almost immediately.
[k]

＠Rider
It is extremely dangerous, and to make matters worse, you cannot guard yourself against it.
[k]

＠Rider
It's impossible to see it coming, so the only thing you can do is run away before you're caught up in it. It is far worse than any mere natural disaster.
[k]

？1：...?
？！

[charaFace E 6]
＠Rider
Well, anyway, I'm just saying that there's still plenty of danger lurking around out here, so we can't go getting careless.
[k]

＠Rider
Just forget about this natural disaster thing for now. It's unlikely we'll be running into it anyway.

Master! I think Mash deserves a double-super-extra helping of praise while we're preparing to fight!

Um, I really much appreciate the sentiment, Senpai...

...but I feel terrible about getting praised like this while you're busy giving orders for battle!
