...I'm afraid not. Men are the lowest rung of society here. We're no more than laborers for the women.

As long as we obey the law, men and women are on equal footing here. At least on paper.
[k]

＠Man
But basic human rights[line 2]things like free speech and such[line 2]all belong to women.
[k]

＠Man
In the court, two opposing men can expect a fair trial, but if it's a man and a woman, the law almost always sides with the woman.
[k]

＠Man
We have no real freedoms. What we eat, when we sleep...our lives are regulated. Naturally, we don't get to choose where we go or what we see either.
[k]

＠Man
So I really have no idea where the empress could be.
[k]

？1：At this point, we'll even settle for rumors.
？！

＠Man
Rumors, huh... In that case... Well, I don't know if there's anything to it, but I've heard that there's some sort of underground facility here.
[k]

But of course, no one, not even proper subjects, can just walk in. You have to be a Torturer or higher to even have a hope of that.

I do remember a guy telling me how a Torturer suddenly showed up out of nowhere right in front of him. He thought he was gonna die.
[k]

＠Man
She wasn't just walking about, either. He said that one moment she wasn't there, and the next, she was.
[k]

＠Man
So, if that place exists, there might be a secret underground entrance to it near where that happened.
