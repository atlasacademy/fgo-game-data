As such, Mash, I would like you to find the optimal escape route for us.

Oh yes, very tough indeed.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Truth be told, they are far out of our league at this moment.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
In fact, to extend the analogy, you might say they're playing a different sport altogether.
[k]

？2：Who are they?

[charaFace B 1]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Simple. A matriarch of sorts, who holds sway over these marionettes, and her loyal slave.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
I'm analyzing your surroundings to find your optimal escape route. However, I'm afraid the enemies are closing in quickly. Please try to hold out a little longer!

My my, that certainly is brave! Although... Seen in another light, it could be a kind of cowardice.

[charaFace B 4]
＠Archer of Shinjuku
Begging for one's life is something humans do to forestall their deaths as long as they can.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
You mustn't deny that. One should only go gentle into that good night when one is certain it is their time.

Oh, but [%1] may be pretty good at buying time if you just let [&him:her] keep talking!

And then there's that other Servant... At least, I think it's a Servant? I can't tell for sure.

I want type A and type AB, I don't need type B, people need transfusions to live, to live as people, they need soapboxes.

＠Christine
If one life is lost, I can move one space forward and become human.

If two lives are lost, I can move one space forward and become human. So one and two are the same.
