As long as you don't give up, dreams DO come true...[sr]I'm living proof of that.

Take a look around. We're standing in a temple of gold! I've dreamed of a place like this ever since I read about Zipang in The Travels of Marco Polo!

He was a wonderful leader for the Resistance. He always knew just what to say, and his allies looked up to him in every way.
[k]

＠Mash
And yet...there was always something nagging at me, making me wonder if we could really trust him.

[charaFace D 8]

Not knowing his True Name was certainly part of it, but even then, it felt like something deeper...

I never gave much thought to what Columbus might value, personally.

＠Fergus
But if he now means [%1] harm, then I'll crush him regardless.

It's no different from the other Agartha rulers we've fought. We just have to keep all of that in mind when we face him.

＠Columbus
When I first awoke here, I couldn't believe how wonderful this world was! It's a paradise!
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Columbus
Hmm, I see you're still confused. Then let me ask you this: What sort of world do you think this is?
[k]

？1：One where men are cruelly oppressed.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Columbus
No no, you've got it backwards.[sr]I'm talking about WHY that's the case.
[k]

？2：One where women control everything.

[charaFace A 12]
＠Columbus
No no, that's not it.[sr]I'm talking about WHY it ended up that way.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 7]
＠Columbus
It's the best part of this whole underground world!
[k]

[charaFace A 8]
＠Columbus
The fact that women can multiply endlessly!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Columbus
You saw it for yourselves, didn't you?[sr]Just a bit of seed, and BAM! A whole new woman!
[k]

＠Columbus
I couldn't believe it! It was like God had answered my prayers and brought all my dreams to life!
[k]

？1：What's so great about women multiplying...?
？！

[charaFace A 11]
＠Columbus
You mean I have to spell that out too?[sr]Because you can sell them for a high price.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Columbus
You can use women for all sorts of things, after all. And to make it even better, these women are stronger than men, which means they can do all sorts of heavy labor that used to be just for male slaves!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Columbus
On top of that, it's easy to make practically endless amounts of them in no time at all! They don't even come out as children! It's a slave trader's dream!

Huh? You think I don't know that? Of course I do.[sr]But that's just how it is in THIS day and age, right?
[k]

＠Columbus
Nobody had a problem with it in my era![sr]I'm just acting according to the values of my own time!
[k]

＠Columbus
And it's not like my people invented slavery.[sr]Greece, Rome, the Middle East...it's been around forever!
[k]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Columbus
And THAT means all your Heroic Spirits who come from those times used slaves back when they were alive, and they didn't think anything of it!
[k]

＠Columbus
Some of those Heroic Spirits hear that slavery's frowned upon now, and decide to go with the times.
[k]

＠Columbus
Others hear that it's frowned upon, but decide slaves are still too useful to give up.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Columbus
That's all it comes down to, right? Who gets to decide whether that's right or wrong? When I grew up, slavery was normal. Who're you to tell me that was wrong?

I have to say, though... God certainly hands out blessings and trials in equal measure. I thought as much back when I crossed the Atlantic.
[k]

＠Columbus
When I first awoke in this dream world come to life, it was already ruled by three queens, and I really had lost all my memories.
[k]

＠Columbus
Maybe whoever summoned me made a mistake somewhere. I couldn't say. Still, I may not've had my memories, but I was still me.
[k]

＠Columbus
So I followed my heart and set out to make my dream come true. At first, things seemed completely hopeless, but I never gave up.
[k]

＠Columbus
Now, how'd I get started... Oh yes.[sr]The first thing I needed was a place to hide out safely...
