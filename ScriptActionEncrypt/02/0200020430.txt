＠Rider
Overconfidence kills on the battlefield. It gets you into battles you cannot win, and I don't want you throwing your life away like that.
[k]

＠Rider
No matter how much you practice, or how good I say you are, you will eventually find yourself outmatched. When that happens, you need to retreat. Period.
[k]

＠Resistance Man
So, it's really okay if I run away?
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Rider
Of course. I don't know why I know this, but the big secret I learned about war...

You could stand to hear this as well.[sr]Take a good look at your opponent.

[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Rider
Charging at an opponent you can't beat will only get you killed. That's not fighting without ever giving up. That's just being bullheaded.
[k]

＠Rider
Telling an unbeatable opponent that you'll never give up no matter what is foolish.
[k]

＠Rider
It's tantamount to giving up on life, and on any chance at victory. The line between bravery and foolishness may be thin, but it is there.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]
＠Rider
So listen: no matter what the situation, the key is to keep thinking about how you can win, and to act accordingly. THAT'S what you should never give up on.
[k]

＠Rider
When you look at it that way, retreating isn't losing.[sr]A draw isn't losing. Hell, losing isn't even losing.
[k]

＠Rider
As long as you never give up on achieving your goal, it means you're making progress towards it. That is ultimately what matters most.

Now then, given all that, what do you think you should say to your opponent?

I believe we can put that down to the difference between a free spirit like you, and people fighting for their freedom like the members of the Resistance.

Still, in a situation like this, the sort of positive thinking he embodies is quite encouraging.
[k]

＠d'Eon
He has that drive, that...je ne sais quoi that every leader needs.

I believe that is why even so powerful a force as the Amazons has been unable to squash the Resistance.
