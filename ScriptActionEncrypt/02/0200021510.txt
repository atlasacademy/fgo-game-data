This underground domain has blended together story and reality to an even greater degree than Shinjuku.

In Shinjuku, that blend merely occurred as a result of Bael's choice to use Phantom Spirits...

...but in Agartha, I sense it to be a deliberate choice.
[k]

＠Holmes
Once this unnatural underground space was created, Heroic Spirits were summoned to it, but with significant alterations made to them.

Some reactions were all but inevitable in such a process. In this case, I believe they were the story each Servant was made to perform.

Assuming that was indeed Wu Zetian's inauthenticity, the final piece is the Amazons, the most elementary of all these errors.

They fall into much the same category as Wu Zetian, in that their historical domain differed greatly from the land they controlled here.

＠Holmes
Precisely.
[k]

＠Holmes
Those who lived in the jungles of South America, the ones who protected El Dorado...
[k]

＠Holmes
...are entirely different from the warrior women of Greek mythology.
[k]

＠Holmes
Some believe that the tribe of women who lived in the jungle only came to be associated due to their similarities to the myth...
[k]

＠Holmes
...and that that is why the river and surrounding area came to be known as the Amazon.
[k]

＠Holmes
In essence, the Greek figures were no more than the model for those in the story of El Dorado.

[charaFace G 5]

And so the fact that Penthesilea lived in El Dorado was itself another inauthenticity.
