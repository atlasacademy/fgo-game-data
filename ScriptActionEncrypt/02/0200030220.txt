＠
...This was certainly reckless.
[k]

＠
But Inshun had no intention of fighting a losing battle.
[k]

＠
He had every confidence in his Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠
The Oboro Urazuki, Eleven Forms.[sr]The ultimate cross-shaped spear technique.
[k]

＠
A form that Inshun had devised himself in[sr]response to his master In'ei's Fifteen Forms.
[k]

＠
An invincible spear technique capable of adapting to any opponent or technique! The accumulation of all his training, said to be on par with the Buddha himself!

＠
Whether using it against an opponent he had never fought before, or against any sort of weapon, armament, or technique, Inshun would never lack the advantage.
[k]

＠
He would parry, counter, or evade anything his opponent threw at him, and follow it up with a fatal strike.
[k]

＠
A great feat, eminently worthy of leaving its mark on humanity and enshrining him as a Heroic Spirit. Ordinarily, no mere human could hope to achieve it.
[k]

＠
And yet, Houzouin Inshun had done so.
[k]

＠
Thus, as a Lancer, Houzouin Inshun was certain that he could fight calmly and with precision for as long as needed, no matter what sort of impossible offensive the mysterious Heroic Spirit he faced might use.
[k]

＠
...Luck was even on his side in a number of ways.
[k]

＠
His only opponent was the swordsman in the cloak.[sr]The other five Heroic Spirits did nothing but observe the battle from afar.
[k]

＠
They did not do this in order to go easy on him. In all likelihood, they were simply ill at ease about working with each other.
[k]

＠
Whatever their reasons for doing so, the other Heroic Spirits staying out of the battle got Inshun thinking.
[k]

＠
Their bloodlust was tremendous, and they had positioned themselves in such a way as to make escape impossible.
[k]

＠
First, he shall dispose of this one enemy.
[k]

＠
That done, it would be possible to find a way out of his predicament, make his escape, and reunite with Musashi and the others[line 2]

[charaTalk H]
The cloaked man no doubt believed he had defended against the attack. There was no mistaking that his katana had blocked the tip of Inshun's spear several times.
[k]

＠
[charaTalk H]
But he was wrong. In fact, Inshun was matching his own strikes to the man's movements. It was impossible for any to defend against this blow.
[k]

＠Cold-Blooded Swordsman
...I see. I should have dodged instead of parrying, huh.

It can be such a pain to capture people with good instincts. You shouldn't be wandering around as a mere Heroic Spirit, Lord Inshun.

You were summoned to Katori Shrine as[sr]nothing less than the seventh Servant!

Really, it's very simple. We need you to be reborn and join us as a Heroic Spirit Swordmaster, whether you want to or not.

＠
Inshun's spear had found its mark.
[k]

＠
It truly had destroyed the swordsman's heart. That much was neither illusion nor trickery. He had indeed succeeded in killing his foe.
[k]

＠
Had the swordsman possessed the flesh and blood body of a living being, or the etheric body of a Heroic Spirit...
[k]

＠
...he would have died instantly.
[k]

He would have, had he only been an[sr]ordinary living being or Heroic Spirit...

＠Inshun
(Now I see. So this is the power of their karma. Indeed, I had never thought to cut what cannot be seen... This is the realm that my spear has not reached!)

(This...this is bad. This is very, very bad.[sr]There is no way to fight creatures like these.)

(Run away, Musashi. Onui. Tasuke.[sr]Run away, and do not stop, [%1].)
[k]

(...Whatever you do, do not let yourselves be caught.)
[k]

＠
That was his final thought...
[k]

...as Houzouin Inshun plunged into darkness.
