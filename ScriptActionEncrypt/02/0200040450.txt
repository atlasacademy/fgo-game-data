You have committed adultery through devilish means,[sr]and robbed the people of Salem of their senses.

You have betrayed God, and indulged in the evil of witchcraft. In the name of God and the good people of Salem, I hereby sentence you to be hanged as a witch!

...Is that so? Very well, the executions are not set to take place for a few hours. State your case.
[k]

＠Sanson
As you know, Your Honor, a large number of people are dissatisfied with this sentence.
[k]

＠Sanson
Salem is also currently beset by attacking monsters,[sr]which are stoking fear and grief in its people.
[k]

＠Sanson
It is eminently possible that these feelings may incite anger and confusion, which would make it much more difficult to keep the peace.
[k]

＠Hopkins
So, you are telling me to be wary of riots?

＠Sanson
This could be dangerous for you personally, Your Honor.

＠Hopkins
My own life is of little consequence.

What's more, I am told that Carter set out to Boston to bring back a new judge.

In which case, regardless of what becomes of me,[sr]the great work of these trials will continue.

What is it? More corpse-eating monsters?

What do you think all these rifles are for!?[sr]Drive them off!

But this time, there are angry villagers among them as well!
[k]

＠Constable
Monsters attacked someone just as he was breaking into the Reverend's house, allowing them to escape!

＠Judge
My Lord... This is blasphemous![sr]We've got to do something. I'll go tell Judge Hopkins!

THIS is the Puritan paradise I spent sixty-six days on a boat to reach? On a voyage in the deathly cold of winter, no less?

I would expect such disruption in a famine, or a revolt, not in a Puritan haven. What a disappointment.

Without the armed reinforcements I've sent numerous telegrams for, there's nothing we can do to hold them off!
[k]

＠Hopkins
Absolutely not.[sr]My execution of these heretics is not yet complete.
[k]

＠Hopkins
We must wait and be certain that these wretched condemned are indeed dead, or the people won't rest secure in the knowledge that justice was served.

＠Judge
Are you mad!? No one is even here to watch any longer!

＠Hopkins
Say what you will. I will not leave until I am satisfied these criminals are dead.
