Be that as it may... Somebody has to hold the Amazons at bay, or the others will have no chance to defeat Penthesilea.
[k]

Even with Megalos on their side, they'd be overwhelmed in terms of sheer numbers.
[k]

＠Astolfo
Yeah, I know. But...

[charaFace B 1]
＠Astolfo
Are you sure you're good with this, Knight of the White Lily...?
[k]

＠Astolfo
Usually when people ask me to do stuff it's little, lighthearted stuff. Y'know, “Pleeease, I'm in trouble and I need your help...”
[k]

＠Astolfo
Not so much the super-serious, head-to-head, life-or-death battle things. So, really, I'm fine with this.
[k]

＠Astolfo
But this kinda isn't your thing. You're all about using your sword to protect Master, right?
[k]

＠d'Eon
Indeed. But at this moment, I happen to be the right person in the right place. And besides...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Astolfo
Huh?
[k]

＠d'Eon
...I may never get another good chance to say this,[sr]so I will say it now.
[k]

＠d'Eon
Astolfo. You are one of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne, a hero to the kingdom of the Franks. Tales of your exploits lulled me to sleep as a child.
[k]

＠d'Eon
If not for you and the other paladins, the kingdom of France might not have existed, and none of us would ever have been born.
[k]

＠d'Eon
You Paladins paved the way for the other knights of France who followed in your footsteps. In a way, you were the exemplar for all we wished to be.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]
＠Astolfo
You...really think so?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]
＠d'Eon
Haha. And now that I stand by your side, facing down an army of hundreds...
[k]

＠d'Eon
...it truly feels as though I have become a part of one of those stories myself.
[k]

＠d'Eon
It may be immodest of me to say so under these circumstances, but if I might be frank...I am positively overflowing with excitement.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Astolfo
Haha, immodest, huh. Sounds great to me!
[k]

＠Astolfo
Well, speaking as your great exemplar who maaay not be the sharpest bulb in the toolbox, I'll say that it's fine to enjoy yourself whenever you can!

Ugh, so much shouting. It's too bad they don't use a battle song, especially one on par with the red Saber or the dragon maiden.

If they had a song as destructive as that, I might've been able to play along with my horn-flute thing!
[k]

＠Astolfo
I got this magical instrument from Logistilla, a witch I know! Normally I can't use it, but with this much magical energy, I can get in at least one good shot!

I hope you all enjoy it as much as those food-stealing harpies did.
