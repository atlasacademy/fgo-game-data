Lady Inferno![sr]Please, wait for me! Where are you going!?

Do you mean to go to the southern edge of Shimousa!? If you continue in this direction, you'll pass through Kazusa and end up in the ocean!

Oh, hello. I could ask the same of you. It's so dark I can't see you very well, but you sound like a young woman of good breeding.

＠Elder Village Man
Are you perhaps the daughter of a samurai? You're so kind to concern yourself with a couple of shriveled up old prunes like us, but don't worry, our house is just ahead.
[k]

＠Elder Village Woman
There was a meeting in the village tonight, and grandfather here had a little too much to drink, so we're only just getting home now.

Go on, my lady, tell him he's too old to drink like he did when he was young.

Oh my... Me, a lady?[sr]I'm just an old crone, but that's very kind of you...
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
I'm told that there are many monsters prowling about at night these days. It's dangerous to be out right now.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Archer of Inferno
So make sure you don't go out again[sr]tonight once you get home. Is that clear?
[k]

＠Elder Village Man
Well, if the daughter of a noble samurai says we should go home and stay put, I guess we'd better do just that.
[k]

＠Elder Village Woman
That's right, dear. You know we're too poor to be out drinking at dinnertime. ...By the way, my lady, I can't help but notice you and your companion are all alone.
[k]

＠Elder Village Woman
Are you lost? Do you have a room for the night?[sr]Perhaps at an inn somewhere?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Archer of Inferno
No, we don't...
[k]

＠Elder Village Woman
Well, if you have nowhere else to go, you are very welcome to stay with us in our humble home.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Archer of Inferno
No, thank you. I am grateful for your kindness,[sr]truly, but I am afraid we still have much to do.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
As such, we cannot afford to sleep just yet.[charaFace B 0][sr]Have a lovely evening, you two. Oh, and...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

How right you are.[sr]Thank you again, and do be careful.

The Curse of Annihilation has successfully overwritten her Spirit Origin exactly as my master intended, producing the desired effect.
[k]

＠
Archer of Inferno kills, and kills, and kills, in order to turn this world into hell.
[k]

＠
Naturally, that was part of the design. However, the karma mechanism guiding the Curse is working TOO well on her.
[k]

＠
Her flames...
[k]

＠
Her flames first consumed an entire fishing village. They literally burned it to the ground. Naturally, there was not a single survivor.
[k]

＠
That is all well and good. It is exactly in line with our lord's expectations. If we are to bring an end to the world of humans, then all humans must die.
[k]

＠
However, the Archer of Inferno did not complete her massacre. Quite unexpectedly, she did not kill the elderly couple we had met earlier!
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
What are you saying, Lady Danzo? We exchanged[sr]pleasantries and expressed concern for one another.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
Whyever would we want to hurt them?[sr]You ninja certainly say the oddest things.
[k]

＠Archer of Inferno
If I did something that cruel,[sr]I would be condemned to hell.
[k]

＠
It worked TOO well!
[k]

＠
By the time I realized that, it was too late. The Archer of Inferno had gone mad, and begun wreathing herself in hellfire.
[k]

＠
She failed to respond to anything I said, and simply proceeded to advance forward while shouting nonsense.
[k]

＠
It was a horrid, red and black march, with the Archer of Inferno leading a procession of black ghosts, spreading fire and death everywhere they went.
[k]

＠
She continued to burn down village after village, but her madness would not stop. The monsters she commanded followed her example. None of them would stop.
[k]

＠
No trace remained of the kind woman she[sr]had been merely half an hour earlier.

There was no longer anything anyone could do to control her. She is wildfire, neither person nor beast, but fire mimicking human form.

In time, the Archer of Inferno will even burn herself up. Perhaps we should not have used ■■ for one of the seven knights after all?

But that is for my master to decide. I am merely here to observe, record, and convey all that transpires.

But, nonetheless.

Your concerns are warranted, Danzo. It would set us back considerably were she to incinerate Onriedo's foundations again, like she did in Hitachi.
