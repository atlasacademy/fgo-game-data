After all, he was originally nothing but an ordinary wolf.

No matter what sort of wolf he may be, he's still a species that existed in 1999. Naturally, he would have had no association with anything related to magecraft.

At that time, there were still some superstitions remaining in the Americas, and while there were no doubt some people who thought of Lobo as the devil, that doesn't make it so.

He was nothing more than an ordinary wolf, a simple animal, a mere Phantom Spirit...
