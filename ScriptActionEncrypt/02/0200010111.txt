Do you have any idea what the Archer of Shinjuku's True Name might be?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
No, I'm afraid not.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Not only am I the world's most eminent artist, but I am also the world's foremost authority on Servants.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Da Vinci
And that one doesn't line up with anything I know.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Even if I narrow the scope to either Archers or Casters, there's always something off about him.
[k]

＠Mash
Yes. I think so too.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]
＠Mash
I get the feeling that he's not just hiding his name.[sr]He might even be disguising his class.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
＠Da Vinci
You too, huh?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Still, I can understand mistaking, say, a Saber for a Berserker...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But mistaking a Caster for an Archer?[sr]That seems seriously unlikely.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]
＠Da Vinci
And then there's his fighting style.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]
＠Mash
Yes, I wondered about that too.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
An Archer who uses bullets? Naturally I've got a few ideas, but he doesn't line up with any of them.
[k]

＠Mash
Hmm...
[k]

[charaFace E 0]
＠Da Vinci
At any rate, we should keep trying to find out who he is. But don't say anything about this to [%1].
[k]

[charaFace A 7]
＠Mash
Understood. I'll continue to investigate his identity while this operation is underway.

Hahaha! You've got me there.[sr]I suppose this must be me in my prime!

Right you are, young knight. I have no memory whatsoever of being young during my prime.

In fact, ever since I got older my memory has been hazy and fragmented. It's really quite troubling.

I will tell you the truth about this city.[sr]In return, you pay me accordingly.

In all my life, there is only one thing in which I've trusted absolutely. And you are not it.

Do you think you can trust me?

[charaFace D 3]

At any rate, neither of us trusts the other yet.[sr]But, I think there's one big thing we can agree on.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
We cannot permit Shinjuku to remain as it is.
[k]

＠Archer of Shinjuku
Evil cannot be permitted to rampage unchecked.[sr]I think it's safe to say we're on the same page there?

You commanded numerous Servants and triumphed over the seven Singularities, right? That must mean you're not only the last Master in the world, you're also the greatest! Now, that I must see for myself!

＠???
To be frank, good cannot survive here.[sr]Here, good is fragile and unreliable.
[k]

＠???
Cooperation is impossible.[sr]Therefore, no choice remains but to rely on others.
[k]

＠???
Reliance makes for less than the sum of its parts.[sr]As such, evil will always refuse good.
[k]

＠???
A cat, all skin and bones, has summoned the last of its strength to consume a dog's remains.
[k]

＠???
Its gaze is as sharp and deadly as a knife.[sr]The rats nearby waiting for scraps dare not approach.
[k]

＠???
A person draws near, hoping to beat the cat to death and devour both it and the dog.
[k]

＠???
Then the rats come, swarming over the three larger creatures until even their bones are gone.
[k]

＠???
Evil consumes both good and evil alike, annihilating each with equal disdain.
[k]

＠???
To survive here, one must either possess great power, or move in a group of like-minded comrades.
[k]

＠???
Unfortunately for me, being part of a group is not something I excel at.
[k]

＠???
So, what am I to do?
[k]

＠???
My investigation of Shinjuku is proceeding apace.
[k]

＠???
Though the knowledge of Shinjuku imparted to me differs greatly from the reality of its insides, the premises of its external structure remain largely intact.
[k]

＠???
There are ruins where buildings should be, and collapsed husks where houses should be.
[k]

＠???
However, there's something different about that building. What could it be?

I have confirmed the presence of a visitor from Chaldea. [&He:She] is now accompanied by...another.
[k]

＠???
[&His:Her] situation is more perilous than [&he:she] realizes.[sr]For that one's heart is pure evil.
[k]

＠???
Believe me, I would know.[sr]For evil is as evil does.
[k]

＠???
From the moment he was born, he only knew contempt.[sr]To him, love has always been a foreign concept.
[k]

＠???
That's why I find [&him:her] standing at his side to be so...frightening.
[k]

＠???
However, if he was to find out what I was up to, I would lose the element of surprise.
[k]

＠???
At the moment, my sole advantage is that nobody knows I'm here.
[k]

＠???
We still believe this Singularity to be some sort of mistake. The result of mere coincidence.
[k]

＠???
No. No, no no!
[k]

＠???
This has all been meticulously planned out from the beginning. With...his...involvement, it had to be!
[k]

...Good. That'll do nicely.
