...Morning.
[k]

＠Sanson
Bonjour, Robin. I see you failed to get a good night's sleep yet again...
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Robin Hood
Mind your own damn business, Frenchie.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Uh...what's that on your plate?[sr]A fried egg on toast?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Robin Hood
Not really a fancy noble's breakfast, huh?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Sanson
I'm not a noble.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sanson
This is a croque madame. I'm told it's quite trendy right now, so I thought I would try it out.
[k]

＠Sanson
I also tried adding a bit of rhubarb jam and cream cheese.
[k]

＠Sanson
It may not look as good as a galette, but it should still be a nice pick-me-up for a busy morning.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Sanson
The only problem is, it's a little too big to eat comfortably...
[k]

＠Robin Hood
How so? Just pick it up and go at it like it's a burger.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Robin Hood
...Hm? What's that pile of paper you've got there?[sr]You reading something?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sanson
I asked Mash for this.
[k]

＠Sanson
It's a book of the plays you all performed in Salem.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Sanson
Heh. It's quite interesting.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Robin Hood
I, uh, I see.

I prepared beverages just in case someone else showed up.

Thank you. I would love some coffee, then.

[charaFace C 4]

＠Medea
...What an odd combination. I feel like I'll get heartburn, sitting between a nice guy and a show-off.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

Yeah, yeah. I wasn't the one who asked you to sit with us, you know.

＠Medea
...By the way, Sanson.
[k]

＠Medea
Is it true you were resummoned at the same time Master and everyone else returned from Salem?
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Medea
And that you don't have any memories of what happened after you Rayshifted there...?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanson
So it would seem. I have no idea what happened in Salem.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sanson
But, strangely enough, I still have my memories of everything that happened prior.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Sanson
Though I'm afraid it resulted in Acting Commander Da Vinci conducting a rather...invasive examination to clear me of any suspicion.
[k]

＠Sanson
Then again, I hear there was recently a big to-do with another imposter, so I suppose I can understand.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]
＠Medea
...I-I see. I guess we both had our fair share of bad luck in that area, though in different senses...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]
＠Robin Hood
Well hey, all's well that ends well, yeah?
[k]

＠Sanson
Easy for you to say. Even I wasn't sure what to make of it all when I was resummoned. It's a strange sensation.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Master and Mash are giving their reports right now.[sr]Once they're done, it'll be my turn.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Robin Hood
Some nonsense about how if we all report in at once, we're likely to fall prey to confirmation bias or something... Ugh, what a pain.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Medea
...So, Robin. Whatever happened to Circe?
[k]

＠Robin Hood
Aha! So that's why you've been following me around since last night, is it?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Robin Hood
Well Medea, lemme ask you... How do you feel about that little pip-squeak?
[k]

＠Robin Hood
I gotta say, she really put one over on us.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Medea
...I think that was her way of getting revenge.[sr]I can't really blame her.
[k]

＠Medea
I definitely wasn't exactly respectful towards her when I was younger.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
And now you are?
[k]

＠Medea
...
[k]

＠Medea
Sometimes, I look back on what she taught me, and I can't help but think I was stubborn and immature...
[k]

＠Medea
I confess, it pains me to admit that, though. So, I thought if I was ever able to see her again...
[k]

＠Medea
...I would have liked to thank her properly.
[k]

＠Medea
While most of what she taught me turned out to be useless, I still appreciated her kindness at times...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Sanson
...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Robin Hood
...I think I know what you mean.
[k]

＠Robin Hood
I hate it when my old master's nagging pops into my head at the worst possible times too.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Medea
Right? So come on, Robin, work with me.[sr]I need more details about what happened in Salem.
[k]

＠Medea
Aren't you curious too, Sanson?[sr]You seem awfully unconcerned about all this...
[k]

＠Sanson
I'm told Master will tell me all about that [&himself:herself] later, so I plan to wait for that.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Robin Hood
...Whoa, seriously?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Medea
What is it, Robin? Why does that have you so shaken up?
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Medea
Come to think of it, you ARE Auntie's type.[sr]Don't tell me you and she...
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Robin Hood
Huh!? What're you talking about? I'm not shook up at all.

...Hey, how about some Monsieur de Paris?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Sanson
...? What did you say?
[k]

＠Robin Hood
You know, that sandwich you're making. It'd be a lot easier to eat if you cut it in half diagonally.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Medea
“Monsieur de Paris”? Is that a recipe you came up with, Sanson?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Sanson
Ah... Now I see. You're suggesting we cut these guillotine style?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Sanson
This may sound strange coming from me, but...that doesn't seem like a great way to start one's morning...
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Medea
Compared to porridge three times a day, that actually sounds rather nice.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Sanson
I see. Well then, if we're going to do this, we'd best do it right.
[k]

＠Sanson
Tomato paste should give it a much bloodier look than rhubarb. We'll need meat for a bit of realism...
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Robin Hood
O-okay, okay, I'm sorry. It was just a joke.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
[charaFace B 1]
[charaFace C 0]

＠Sanson
Haha... So was that.
[k]

＠Sanson
Once Mash and Master get back, I think I'll ask them what they think of this recipe too.
[k]
