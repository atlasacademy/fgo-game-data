You're so beautiful...

[charaFace B 4]

＠Gerda
Oh, but I did see something else[sr]beautiful just a little while ago.
[k]

＠Gerda
It was a rainbow! A huge, seven-colored rainbow that stretched all the way past the mountains!
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Gerda
Nobody else saw it, but I did.[sr]Isn't that amazing? Hehe!

I wonder why Fou is in such a good mood.[sr]Could it be the weather?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Maybe he likes it cold like this?
[k]

＠Mash
There, look, Senpai. We've only just met Gerda,[sr]and Fou has already taken to her.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mash
Oh, wait. Maybe it's the other way around,[sr]and Gerda's actually the one who's taken to him?
[k]

？1：I think so.
？2：...She's a cheerful girl, isn't she?

？！

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Yes. She's very cheerful.
[k]

＠Mash
And it sounds like she came all this way to find special medicine for a friend back in her village...
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
She must be very responsible, too.

There's something I'm wondering about, though...
[k]

＠Mash
She said she was looking for medicinal herbs, right?[sr]Does that mean plants can grow around here?
[k]

＠Mash
Not to mention that, if this is an emergency...
[k]

＠Mash
...why is she out here all by herself?
[k]

＠Mash
I don't know about other regions in this Lostbelt,[sr]but it's no secret dangerous giants roam around here.
[k]

＠Mash
And of course, there's no way an ordinary human could fight a giant alone. They'd be dead for sure.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
If someone needed to come out here...
[k]

＠Mash
...shouldn't it be an armed group[sr]of adults who know how to fight...?
[k]

？1：Those are all good points.
？2：There must be more to this we don't know yet.

＠Gerda
Are you guys talking about me?
[k]

＠Gerda
That's right. I left my village to look for medicinal herbs! The grown-ups are too busy getting ready for tomorrow, so we kids have to take care of ourselves.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Gerda
And since I'm the big sister,[sr]I have to do my best to pull my weight.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Gerda
That's pretty mature of me, right? Hehe.

[charaFace B 2]

＠Gerda
We only see them occasionally near the village, but I know there's lots of giants around these mountains.
[k]

＠Gerda
Still, there's nothing else I can do... The only one who knows how to use runes is the envoy, and she isn't coming until tomorrow.
[k]

＠Gerda
Her runes of healing can cure[sr]people who are sick in no time...
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Gerda
...but Laura probably won't survive[sr]through the night without those herbs...

That's why I came all this way. Someone told me that there were amazing healing herbs near here.

They said they can cure anything,[sr]and that they're especially good for fevers!

Well, yes. Nobody's ever supposed to leave.[sr]Isn't it like that in your village, too?

＠Gerda
The only ones permitted to go outside the village are the envoys chosen to be servants of the gods.
[k]

＠Mash
(God...)

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
Um, I'm sorry, but can you explain what[sr]you mean by “the gods” and “envoys”?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Gerda
Hehe, nice try![sr]But you won't trick me that easily!
[k]

＠Gerda
Lady Mash, girl in black armor.
[k]

＠Gerda
People have always told me that only envoys of the Goddess have swords or spears...
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Gerda
...but I didn't know you used shields, too![sr]That's amazing, Lady Mash!

Hooray! I was hoping you might offer to help me![sr]Ooh, does that mean you can read my mind?

Even if you don't have any weapons of your own,[sr][&Mr. Black Hair:Ms. Red Hair]...

...you must be an envoy of the gods, too!
