I have to apologize again, Senpai.
[k]

＠Mash
Even after all of Da Vinci's reminders[sr]to be careful, I still let my guard down.
[k]

＠Mash
I know I need to be extra vigilant in watching for magical energy signals and Servants, especially since we can't contact the Border...
[k]

＠Mash
...and yet, I completely failed at that task...
[k]

？1：Don't worry, Mash. It's okay. Really.

＠Mash
...Thank you, Senpai.
[k]

？2：Let's take this as a reminder of why we need to be more careful.

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
Right.[sr]I promise, I won't make the same mistake again!

Given that we're unable to contact the Shadow Border, we're effectively cut off from Chaldea itself. I need to keep that in mind.
[k]

＠Mash
In accordance with the Chaldea Personnel Code,[sr]Article 23, Paragraph 2...
[k]

＠Mash
...it's imperative that I remain calm,[sr]and proceed with caution.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Mash
In other words...I'm free to make decisions, act independently, and return to base at my own discretion!
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
...And then make an official report, of course.
[k]

？1：Personnel Code, Article 23, Paragraph 2, huh...
？2：It seems kind of, uh, sparse on the details...

？！

＠Mash
Yes, it is. Dr. Roman added[sr]Paragraph 2 when no one was looking.
[k]

？1：That explains it.

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Yes...[wt 0.4][charaFace A 7][sr]All right, let's resume our expedition, Senpai.

？2：That's just like him.

[charaFace A 13]

Yes. It is, isn't it?

Since there are a lot of trees in this area, I think it would be better to put the Ollerus Boards away and move around on foot for a while.

＠Mash
Okay, Senpai.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
...They're not really just[sr]frozen trees then, are they?

I can't tell if they were carved from ice, or if all these tree-like formations were stuck in the ground...

There are more of them gathered together there than anywhere else we've seen so far.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
Maybe the path we took to avoid the fiery mountains ended up bringing us to their territory.

＠Mash
Something has been bothering me about him.
[k]

＠Mash
Sigurd is one of the greatest[sr]heroes in all of Scandinavia.
[k]

＠Mash
He reforged King Sigmund[line 2]his father's demonic sword, Gram, after the divine spear Gungnir shattered it...
[k]

＠Mash
...then went on to defeat the dragon Fafnir and gain its wisdom. That all fits with what Holmes told us.
[k]

＠Mash
Later, he and Brynhild the Valkyrie fell in love, but their relationship was poisoned by hate, and ended with his death...
