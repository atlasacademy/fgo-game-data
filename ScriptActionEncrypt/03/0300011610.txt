The flowers that bloomed here[sr]were so beautiful...so strong.

Look at this.[sr]These must be the hardiest flowers in the world.

Then you too are a flower. A flower blooming[sr]strong here in the confines of the palace.

That's what I wanted to say. Maybe I actually did.[sr]Or maybe I was never able to summon up the courage.

Dad? Why do Yaga have to be strong?

Well, the way I see it, we Yaga made a mistake.

A mistake?

We mistook how the world works...or maybe how we chose it? Whatever it was, we made a mistake, and the world left us behind.

Still, while we may have made a mistake,[sr]that doesn't mean we were in the wrong.

＠Holmes
Lostbelt. A chronological table detailing an alternate path taken by human history. An unbroken strip that continues onward to the present day, rather than occupying a single point in time.
[k]

＠Holmes
...No wonder it isn't like a Singularity. A Singularity is one point in time where history as it should be went awry, after all.

[charaFace G 6]

＠Holmes
That is not the case here in Russia. In this world, everything is as it should be. Nothing has gone awry.

[charaFace G 0]

＠Holmes
It has history quite separate from our own Proper Human History, even though it is not a world gone completely mad like the Singularities.
[k]

＠Holmes
No doubt the branching point was the Great Cold Wave that struck four hundred and fifty years ago, when Earth was thrown into a new ice age.

By definition, they're closely tied to a well-defined base world. In other words, the base world and its parallel worlds are all following the same course.

But let's say there is a world where history diverges radically, going completely off the rails.

[charaFace A 24]

Say, at one point, something changes irrevocably...it could be a huge natural disaster, or a major technological breakthrough...

...and the world that's gone off the rails is effectively erased from this universe, deemed to be something that doesn't belong.

＠Holmes
Generally speaking, one would indeed expect to find her with him, but it is highly improbable that she would be summoned as a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace G 6]

＠Holmes
Of course, she could still have been an inhabitant of THIS world, just like Ivan the Terrible, which would have made her summoning possible...
[k]

＠Holmes
...but given that she is human in appearance,[sr]that seems altogether improbable as well.
[k]

？1：So then, she's the Romanov Dynasty one?
？2：That would mean she's the other Anastasia then?
？！

[charaFace G 0]

＠Holmes
Precisely.[sr]Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanova.
[k]

＠Holmes
She is the Grand Duchess of Ice, a young girl[sr]who bore the brunt of Russia's darkness.

I anticipated certain emergencies may arise eventually, so I took the liberty of collecting as much useful data from it as I could.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Holmes
Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanova.
[k]

＠Holmes
She is the fourth daughter of the last Romanovs ever to hold the tsardom: Nikolai II, and his wife, Alexandra.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Holmes
In the years before her death, famine plagued all of Russia as a result of the ongoing First World War.
[k]

＠Holmes
In 1917, frustrations reached a breaking point.[sr]Efforts to quell a protest left some people dead.
[k]

＠Holmes
Some of Russia's soldiers banded together in revolt against the tsardom. Moscow declared martial law in response, but by then, the imperial guards had chosen to side with the rebels.
[k]

＠Holmes
After a tremendous uproar, the Tsar abdicated. The Romanov imperial family fell into disarray, and were essentially confined to house arrest.
[k]

＠Holmes
The historical records described[sr]Nikolai as a good husband and father...
[k]

＠Holmes
...but in light of these events, it would seem he[sr]was ill-equipped to handle the threat to his reign.
[k]

[charaFace G 6]

＠Holmes
Alternatively, he may have been perfectly well-equipped, but the times may have simply been too dire for anyone in his position to overcome.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Holmes
In the wake of these events, Russia would end up split into several different factions, eventually uniting as a single nation known as the Soviet Union...but that bit of history can wait for another time.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Holmes
For the moment, let us focus our[sr]attention on Nikolai II's family.
[k]

＠Holmes
Having been confined to their home, their lavish lifestyle evaporated practically overnight, and they were seldom heard from again.
[k]

＠Holmes
Although records do say that they[sr]continued to employ servants and cooks.
[k]

＠Holmes
...At any rate, the situation grew more[sr]dire the following year, in April of 1918.
[k]

＠Holmes
The new Leninist administration feared that the Czechoslovak Legion or White Army would try to reinstate the Tsar's family by force, and decided to have them executed.
[k]

＠Holmes
Ideally, they would have preferred to do so following a trial, in order to create an official record...
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Holmes
...but the threat the Tsar's reinstatement posed to their administration forced their hand.
[k]

＠Holmes
Being the cousin of the German kaiser, Anastasia's mother, Alexandra, still had some value as a bargaining chip...
[k]

＠Holmes
...but that value evaporated the instant the German ambassador was assassinated by extremists.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Holmes
In essence, everything about Anastasia's family[line 2]their bloodline, their presence, their very existence[line 2]was seen as a hindrance.
[k]

＠Holmes
This led the powers that be to refrain from making the Romanovs' sentence public, and so instead they determined to do away with them in secret.

So they were executed. At least, that is how those in power would like it described. Those who were present said it was, in truth, no more than a massacre.
[k]

＠Holmes
Some believed that Anastasia managed to survive her family's execution...but that theory was thoroughly disproven several decades later thanks to DNA testing.
[k]

＠Holmes
There is simply no denying that this innocent young girl had her life ripped from her simply because she was born to the wrong family at the wrong time.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Holmes
Anastasia's story is indeed one of tragedy.[sr]She is one of many sacrificed on the altar of history.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_79 0.5]

However, although her story in Proper Human History ends there, it continues in the history of magecraft.

＠Holmes
I'm afraid the answer to that question remains unclear. They may have had some secret involvement in it, or they may merely have known of its existence.
[k]

＠Holmes
All we know for certain is that a number of lost Fabergé eggs made their way into the world of magecraft.
[k]

＠Holmes
...From that, we learned that each generation's tsar had formed a contract of sorts with a certain Phantasmal.
[k]

＠Holmes
However, as this rumored Phantasmal did not see fit to save Tsar Nikolai II's life, the notion was dismissed as false...
[k]

＠Holmes
...but after seeing Anastasia fight, I have[sr]determined that there is another possibility.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Holmes
She is a shaman, a spirit keeper.
[k]

＠Holmes
In other words, it was neither her father, Nikolai, nor her brother, Alexei, who was the heir to the Romanov magecraft. It was indeed Anastasia herself.
