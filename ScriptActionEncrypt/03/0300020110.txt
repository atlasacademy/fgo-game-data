...Everything is so white.
[k]

＠
The words “blank slate” have never seemed so appropriate.[sr]It's like the entire surface has been...reset.
[k]

＠
Nothing but pure white wherever you look.[sr]Everything is gone.
[k]

＠
Nature...civilization...even the flora and fauna have completely disappeared. No, not disappeared... It's more like they've all been pruned away.
[k]

＠
All there is to see in every direction is a pure, white plain[line 2]though there were a few topographical exceptions along the way.
[k]


＠
It looked like the remains of some buildings, but they appeared to have been warped by extreme heat, or destroyed in some kind of shock wave.
[k]

＠
Whatever the cause, upon closer inspection, one could see that these had once been man-made structures of some kind.
[k]

＠
This led to [%1] and [&his:her] allies stepping[sr]out of the Shadow Border to investigate further.
[k]

＠
The atmospheric composition was normal. The air was breathable, and the gravity was the same as before. There was no need for a hazard suit or space suit or anything of the sort.
[k]

＠
“Good thing you didn't have to get all dressed up like an astronaut, huh?” said Leonardo da Vinci with a cherubic smile.

...Look, Senpai, you can see them up ahead... Buildings.

If there are any survivors here, we should bring them back to the Border as soon as[line 2]
[k]

＠
She trailed off all of a sudden. Probably because what she saw was beyond anything she could have imagined.
[k]

＠
No one could blame her. Anyone else would have been agape at the bizarre sight before them.
[k]

＠
The color had been drained out of everything. Some parts of the buildings even looked as though they had been rubbed away with an eraser.
[k]

＠
The whole thing looked like some bizarre postmodern art exhibit, and was made all the more baffling by being in the middle of a bleached desert.
[k]

＠
There were no signs of life anywhere,[sr]not even the remains of what had once been alive.
[k]

＠
It all looked so sterile, especially for ruins.[sr]It was the sort of thing you'd only see in dreams.
[k]

＠
Everyone back on the Border seeing it on their monitors must have thought they were looking at footage from an alien planet.

Earth had changed.
[k]

＠
It had been completely bleached[line 2]a planet now totally devoid of life, with the exception of the Lostbelts.
[k]

＠
But even when it had been reset to a blank slate, there were still some places, some buildings, some life-forms that had survived.
[k]

＠
Chaldea decided to call these “remnants.”
[k]

＠
Today was the first contact they had with these sorts of remnants[line 2]these buildings that had been left behind on this newly blank Earth.
[k]

＠
Despite the new director's pessimistic outlook, the other staff couldn't ignore the possibility, however slight, that there might still be other survivors.
[k]

＠
But even though they never did find any other people,[sr]their investigation wasn't for nothing.
[k]

＠
Because they did find signs of life. Signs that someone had survived all this, and had been here before them.
[k]

＠
Here, near the Scandinavian Lostbelt, in what[sr]used to be Helsinki, the capital of Finland...

Signs that someone had been living here[sr]for days...weeks...maybe even months.
[k]

＠
Empty bottles...piles of canned food... The remains of a communication device that someone had clearly spent a great deal of effort trying to repair...
[k]

＠
There was even something that looked like a doll lying on the floor[line 2]a sign that a young child had been among the survivors.
[k]

＠
And above all, they found something that had clearly been left behind with intent...
[k]

＠Mash
...According to this journal, it looks like[sr]somebody was here as recently as two days ago.
[k]

＠Mash
The last entry is dated[sr]the day before yesterday.
[k]

＠Mash
It looks like there were six survivors at first, but over time, their numbers gradually dwindled, until...
[k]

＠Mash
...[sr]...
[k]

＠Mash
In the end, whoever wrote this journal must have been the last one to disappear... Where could they all have gone?
[k]

＠
Unfortunately, though whoever wrote the journal had excellent penmanship, it was in a language that [%1] could not read.
[k]

＠
It could have been Finnish, or maybe Swedish... Either way, it may as well have been Greek to [%1].
[k]

＠Mash
“Why did this happen to our planet? Why do these invaders from another world hate humanity so much?”
[k]

＠
If nothing else, those final questions written[sr]on the last pages were clear. Why? Why? Why?
[k]

＠
That is all these people could ask, even as they were wiped away... Almost as though they were being punished for seeking meaning in their crisis.
[k]

＠Mash
...It's time, Master.[sr]Let's head back to the Border.
[k]

＠Mash
We're almost to Sweden now.[sr]You should rest up for the coming battles.
[k]

＠
As they left the remnants behind,[sr]one thought haunted each and every one of them:
[k]

＠
Nowhere was there so much as a trace of blood,[sr]a hint of violence.
[k]

＠
...Soon, the Shadow Border will[sr]enter the second Lostbelt.
[k]

＠
Will it be a hellish wasteland inhospitable to life?[sr]Or perhaps...
