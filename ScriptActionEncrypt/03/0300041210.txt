＠Da Vinci
All right, now that we've all adjusted to our new surroundings, it's time for the lecture I promised. You keep walking, I'll keep talking.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Asclepius is a hero from Greek mythology. [bgm BGM_EVENT_79 0.1]His father[sr]was the Olympian god Apollo, and his mother was a woman[sr]named Coronis, making him a demigod.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Shortly after his birth,[sr]he was entrusted to a centaur sage...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That's right. Our very own Chiron.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Asclepius first studied medicine under him, but his talent for medicine surpassed his teacher's eventually.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In addition to the sun, Apollo was also the god of sickness and healing, so that's probably where Asclepius got his talent for medicine.
[k]

[charaFace D 28]

＠Da Vinci
To elaborate, he took the knowledge of herbology Chiron imparted to him and expanded on it...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...which led to the concept of medicine as we know it today spreading far and wide.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]

＠Da Vinci
Up to that point, healing had strictly been the domain of the gods, which is probably why he came to be known as the father of medicine, and a god in his own right.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
At the time, the concept of a doctor[line 2]someone with both the knowledge and skills to treat injuries and disease in someone other than themself...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...and a patient[line 2]the beneficiary of the doctor's knowledge and skill[line 2]was a huge paradigm shift...and Asclepius is the one who made it happen.
