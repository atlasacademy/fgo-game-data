I knew it had to be a helluva place from the images we captured at a distance, but seeing it in person...

Hm, it is quite a peculiar city...if indeed a city it can be called.

My concern lies in whether it fulfills the[sr]functions we typically associate with cities.

Those things packed around its perimeter must be the rockets Qin Shi Huang uses to distribute the Benefactions.

＠Da Vinci
The emperor's gotta have more than[sr]enough here to cover the entire planet.
[k]

[charaFace F 14]

＠Da Vinci
I guess this explains how Qin Shi Huang could rule[sr]the whole world with just this one city.

So far as I can tell from here, there does not appear to be anything in the way of residential buildings.

＠Da Vinci
Hmm, that's the key question, isn't it? At least that would be what determines whether or not this is a city in the sense we usually think of them.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Even if there are people living here, I have a suspicion it's far fewer than in our own cities.

Given that even this world's soldiers are robots, I have a hard time believing there is any particular need for a human labor force.
[k]

＠Holmes
There does seem to be a deal of activity taking place, so it is doubtful the city is totally uninhabited...

...I think you'll find it faster to just[sr]go in and take a look for yourself.

＠Koyanskaya
Shouldn't take long for even you lot to[sr]figure out what the culture here is like.
[k]

[charaFace D 16]

＠Koyanskaya
Not that they'll be opening the gate and welcoming you with open arms anytime soon, of course.

That's the royal guard of Xianyang, the elite soldiers assigned to protect the emperor even in times of peace, without ever being put to sleep in Mt. Li.

Oh and, just so you know... They're a far, far cry from the supervisors you fought back on that farm.
