I don't think those are Noble Phantasms. They're probably Baobei depicted in The Investiture of the Gods. So I can understand why she has them...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...but the Nezha we know has never exhibited this kind of fighting ability. There's something else going on here.

＠Holmes
She did say that Arjuna shared one of his Divinities with her. I suspect the key lies there.
[k]

＠Holmes
This is no natural Divine Spirit amalgamation, like we've seen with Sitonai. This is a case of divine elements simply being fused into an existing being.
[k]

＠Holmes
As difficult as it may be to believe...
[k]

＠Holmes
...if one of Arjuna's Divinities is truly able to coexist with a Servant's Spirit Origin...
[k]

＠Holmes
...that would indeed explain this remarkable increase in her power and abilities.

＠Peperoncino
Assuming he gave her one of the Lōkapāla regents tasked with defending different directions, I'd say Kubēra's probably at the top of the list of possibilities.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Kubēra's the god of wealth and treasure, so that would explain why she has such an abundance of power now.
[k]

？1：Kubēra...
？2：I've never heard that name before...
？！

＠Peperoncino
Not well known in your neck of the woods, huh?[sr]Trust me, he's a very important god in India.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
There are all sorts of stories about him, but they all agree that he was the guardian of the north.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
He was also known as Dānapati, the Lord of Wealth,[sr]and as Vaisravana, son of Vishrava...
[k]

[charaFace G 9]

＠Peperoncino
Though in Japan, he might be better[sr]known as Tamonten or Bishamonten.

Kubēra... I think he was Ravana's half brother. As I recall, he battled Ravana, only to lose both the fight and control over the island of Lanka.
[k]

＠Rama
And in that case, he has some connection to me as well...or rather, to Sita.
