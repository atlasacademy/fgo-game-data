Argh, this is ridiculous![sr]Even I can tell something's off about me!
[k]

[charaFace A 20]

＠Koyanskaya
Thinking back on it, I haven't been my usual spiteful self ever since Qin Shi Huang captured me...
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
If I'd just planted a bomb or three when I snuck onto the Shadow Border, and blown everyone to kingdom come...
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
...I could've spent the rest of my time on a leisurely tour of the Lostbelts... I swear, what was I thinking?
[k]

[charaFace A 25]

＠Koyanskaya
...No, no, I shouldn't dwell on it.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
No capable woman would let what she did or didn't do in the past stop her in the present!
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Koyanskaya
I'm just going to focus on business here! Once I get in my groove, I'll get my old spite back in no time flat.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I'll just check in on the Tree of Emptiness's growth now and then, and devote most of my time to seeing what sorts of wonderful creatures I can find in this boring old world.

[charaFace A 16]

＠Koyanskaya
This works out nicely for me. They're just the sort of thing that makes abandoning a Lostbelt worthwhile.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
China's regime was so ridiculously strict and thorough about getting rid of anything it didn't like that there was nothing left for me to have fun with...
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Koyanskaya
But here, I can get back to my roots and really mess with everything humans love. Chaldea just adores that sort of thing.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Koyanskaya
This world is very hospitable to human life, but also extremely strict about virtue and goodness.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
If a human strays from the path even once, their god's law won't even let them reincarnate anymore.
[k]

[charaFace A 21]

＠Koyanskaya
Ahh, that's what I love about boring, single-minded gods. They're as cruel and merciless as they come.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Koyanskaya
Still, I don't much care for this world's god,[sr]or that shitty monk and his creepy-ass grin...
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
...so I think I can spare some time to mess with them while I take care of business!
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Koyanskaya
Maybe I'll take one of those blissfully ignorant humans and wrench the smile from their face juuust a tiny bit.
[k]

[charaFace A 16]

＠Koyanskaya
Hehehe, why, I'd bet that's exactly what some people actually want.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
And walking the line between supply and demand is an important service in its own right♡

＠Ganesha
Hmm. So you're always on the lookout for this Sita person, huh?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Rama
Yes, I am. If you happen to see her anywhere, please let me know right away. ...You don't know what she looks like? Not a problem.
[k]

＠Rama
If you ever see the greatest woman in the world[line 2]one so beautiful and graceful with inner strength that could move mountains[line 2]and think she would be perfect as my wife, you'll know you've found Sita.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Ganesha
I, uh, I see... Hmm...
[k]

＠Ganesha
I still like the whole hot shota king thing you've got going on, but knowing you've already got a canon ship makes it a lot harder to fantasize about you.
[k]

＠Ganesha
I'm sure some people wouldn't let it hold them back, but somehow, I'm not really into that.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Ganesha
Oh well, guess I'll just have to keep my fantasies to a minimum and enjoy gazing on some hot Rama flesh in real life!
[k]

＠Rama
I am...not sure what you're talking about... Some kind of protective spell? In that case, I will gladly accept it.

Something has seemed off to me since this morning.[sr]No, not just off. It's...outright strange.

That's true. The change in the environment is even more drastic than I was expecting.
[k]

＠Mash
The ground is dry and barren, the wind is much stronger and foul-smelling, the plants are all dead or dying... Everything is so different from yesterday.
[k]

[charaFace F 12]

＠Mash
Maybe this area drains really easily, so all the sunlight it got yesterday dried it up?

Whatever the cause, this area is clearly much more arid than it was yesterday.

There's gotta be something particular to this Lostbelt that's responsible for this.

We'll just have to ask Asha or someone when we get the chance.

Does it make anyone else uncomfortable,[sr]or is it just me?
[k]

＠Mash
It's like...I can't sense much in the way of life now.
[k]

＠Mash
Compared to yesterday, it feels like everything's cold and inhospitable, if not outright hostile...

I agree. The air is even drier today.

＠Karna
It feels as though there is something else in this world now... Something besides the mysterious presence that has been holding us back since we first came here.
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Karna
It may not be likely to harm us outright, but it could still interfere with our ability to fight.
[k]

＠Karna
I recommend you keep that in mind, Master.
[k]

？1：What do you mean?
？！

[charaFace D 0]

＠Karna
...I mean that there is a difference between fighting in a blessed paradise, and fighting in a cursed place of death.
[k]

＠Karna
Though of course, a true warrior remains strong regardless of their environment.
[k]

？1：I see... Thanks, I'll be careful.
