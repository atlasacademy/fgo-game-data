This is where Qin Shi Huang keeps all the[sr]treasures of the sage world on display.

＠Koyanskaya
There should be bark and leaf samples from the Fusang[sr]Tree right around here... [wt 1.0][charaFace C 9]Ah, there we go.

I trust nobody will mind if I borrow[sr]these for a moment? Wonderful.

Well, I'd say that wraps up our business here, but while we're at it, would you like to see the real thing?

Qin must have transplanted the Fusang Tree to the innermost sanctum after pulling it out of the sage world.

[charaFace A 6]

＠Holmes
Oh, I was never sure of it. It was never more than a hunch. The Tree of Emptiness's whereabouts being so unclear all this time simply made no sense.
[k]

＠Holmes
It was therefore only natural to suspect it may be connected to this Lostbelt's most mysterious object, which also happened to be a tree.

It's like I told you before, Yuie:[sr]you can't play mind games against Chaldea.

＠Koyanskaya
They're so good with that stuff you'd think[sr]they were working off an answer sheet.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
So don't think of this as giving the tree's location away. Think of it as leading lambs to the slaughter.

[charaFace C 17]

＠Koyanskaya
So as a Crypter, all you have to do is play the executioner and use Mayall's power as a guillotine.
