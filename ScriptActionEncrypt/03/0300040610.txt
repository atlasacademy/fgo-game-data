I understand your shock and confusion, but since we must rely on accurate information, let me be clear.

＠Holmes
Your Noble Phantasm did not so much as scratch him.

＠Holmes
Furthermore, he did not take any sort of defensive action against it. It simply failed to do anything to him.

At first I thought it might be an effect of the enormous amount of power he's concentrating near him, but that doesn't appear to be the case either.
[k]

＠Holmes
Which would mean he possesses some sort of anti-interference ability that not even Rama's Noble Phantasm can penetrate.
[k]

＠Holmes
But how is that possible...?
