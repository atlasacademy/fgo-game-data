Servant memories are weird. It doesn't matter if they're from before your current body's age, or after.
[k]

＠
Everything that ever happened to you while you were alive comes flooding into your head all at once.
[k]

＠
They're simultaneously your own memories, and the recollections of a complete stranger. Facts you know to be true, and lies no more real than a dream.
[k]

＠
...I think that's why I remember[line 2]why I know what I once did.
[k]

＠
I remember the end of the war, when I heard that Dhrishtadyumna's cowardly plot had succeeded, that my father had been killed.
[k]

＠
I remember when I heard that Bhima had cheated to inflict a fatal wound on Duryodhana, the oldest of the hundred Kaurava princes.
[k]

＠
Everything inside of me vowed[sr]then that I would make them pay.

I swore I would exact revenge[sr]on them by any means necessary.
[k]

＠
So I chose to sneak in under the cover of night and murder all of my enemies in their sleep.
[k]

＠
You think that cowardly? Criminal? An affront to all that is good and just? I don't care. I don't care! I don't care!!!
[k]

＠
I was so angry I didn't care about anything else. I think that's when I threw away everything in me besides fury.
[k]

＠
I let my fury swallow me whole until I was nothing more than a beast...a vessel of pure rage.
[k]

＠
To put it another way...that was the moment when Aśvatthāman became no more than anger incarnate.

So of course, the peaceful scenery of the Kṛta Yuga only infuriates him. The sweet scent of pollen, the sun's gentle rays, the birds' happy chirping...his only response to it all is to grow ever more enraged.
[k]

＠
Everything he sees, and doesn't see, makes him angry. But the things that anger him most...are those he sees both constantly, and never.
[k]

＠
He is always angry. Always.

There we go. That takes care of the lost, out-of-season kali. Guess you can't even go through the Kṛta Yuga without running into at least one.

You know, there were always some dumb beasts up in the mountains who'd forget to hibernate for the winter, too.

I'd always hunt 'em whenever I happened to see one. There's no telling what sort of trouble a dumb beast could get up to.

Oh my. That's surprisingly careless of him, leaving behind so many physical records like that. Although...

That's why I decided to fight back. I think everyone else in our village more or less feels the same.

＠Mash
Even if you are a different aspect of her that was summoned, or were embedded with a Divinity...you're still Nezha, aren't you?

＠Mash
And the Nezha we knew always[sr]had a strong sense of justice.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Mash
In this world...the only measure of something's value is whether god deems it worthy or not.
[k]

＠Mash
He's the sole arbiter of what should and should not be.
[k]

＠Mash
I think that's inherently unjust... It disparages the value in feelings, memories, life, and death alike.
