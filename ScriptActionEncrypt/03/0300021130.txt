？1：Where are the giants!?

I'm scanning for magical energy signals right now...!

？2：I didn't see any giants outside. Are they already inside!?

＠Mash
I'm afraid that's a definite possibility!

？！

＠Mash
The outer walls and gate all appear to be intact, but we still can't see what's happening around the fields!
[k]

＠Mash
I don't like that we had to climb over the gate without permission...but this is an emergency!

“No need for that. I'm not cold.”

＠Gerda
But their clothes were all ragged, and their face was hidden, so we were worried.

We invited them inside again, but they just clicked their tongue and said, “I'm from Chaldea. Don't worry about me.”
