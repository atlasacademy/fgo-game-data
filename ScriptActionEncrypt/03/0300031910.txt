“Proper” Human History. What a pretentious name. You wear your arrogance in believing that yours is the only true course of events on your sleeve.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
In spite of this arrogance, you behave as if your actions are dictated by morality.

You are quite correct.

＠Qin Shi Huang
By concentrating this land's bounty in a single point,[bgm BGM_EVENT_79 0.1][sr]we have become the ultimate human.

＠Qin Shi Huang
Has any one individual ever ascended to such[sr]heights in your so-called Proper Human History?

＠Qin Shi Huang
Behold our Great Wall encircling the sky. Behold the great harvest produced by the land. Who else could ever boast such greatness?

Humans in groups cannot accomplish anything. They are shackled by discord, by conflict, by contradictions.

So there will be no humans, no groups.

Utter drivel.

＠Qin Shi Huang
The true measure of a human...is responsibility.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
It lies in bearing responsibility for this world[line 2]its skies, lands, and oceans, and the lives of all who dwell within.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
Can those of you from Proper Human History choose which species will go extinct? Can you decide the amount of coal that will pollute your atmosphere?

I, and those who know me as a Heroic Spirit,[sr]have walked many distant worlds.

You said to look at your Great Wall in the sky? I did. All I see is a monument to your so-called eternal empire's limitations.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
You said you built that wall in order to defend against threats from other stars? Talk about preposterous.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
True, they'd have no way of building something like that in Proper Human History's twenty-first century.

But if they'd had the same resources at their disposal, you can bet they'd use them to explore beyond our world, not shut themselves away.
