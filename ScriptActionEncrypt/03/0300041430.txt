I know I brought some sacred beasts along with me, but I can't let the kali run rampant either.

＠Tell
Part of our job is making sure the judgments are handled impartially. Any imbalances need to be corrected.

Especially seeing how there's a whole new giant kali I've never seen before now. Maybe he's the alpha or something?

I may have perfectly healed your physical injuries thanks to my medical expertise and his abundant magical energy...

The memory of your precious arrows failing to find their targets...
[k]

＠Asclepius
The abject defeat you suffered as an Archer unable to land a single shot on your intended target...
[k]

Those are the kind of things that leave a deep, permanent mark on your Spirit Origin. Much as I hate to admit it, even I can't cure that.

It's nothing major, mind you. I was just curious why I was the last Lōkapāla summoned, is all.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Tell
He already had Nezha, the son of the great Chinese hero Li Jing, and you, the legendary god of medicine from Greek mythology.
[k]

＠Tell
Not to mention Aśvatthāman, the heroic half-incarnation of Shiva from the Mahabharata, was here even before you two.

So with all those amazing mythical figures around...why would he pick an ordinary guy like me as his final Lōkapāla?

Besides, we don't even know if he summoned you on purpose. You'd have to ask him or the Alter Ego about that.
