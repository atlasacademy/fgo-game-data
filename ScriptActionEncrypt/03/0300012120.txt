Kadoc Zemlupus. I know how little[sr]I'm capable of better than anyone.
[k]

＠
My magecraft is mediocre, and my family history is practically nonexistent.
[k]

＠
Our bloodline only goes back about two hundred years. Nothing worth being proud of.
[k]

＠
But I was still chosen to be a Master. Not for my lineage, or my spellwork, but for the power I was born with.
[k]

＠
I already felt like I'd wasted my life, so hearing they needed my help was the greatest joy I could imagine.
[k]

＠
After I came to Chaldea and joined Team A, I think my pride and my inferiority complex positively exploded.
[k]

＠
Every single member was an absolutely top-notch talent.
[k]

＠
Mash Kyrielight was a test-tube baby born and raised in Chaldea. She was more like another piece of equipment than a person.
[k]

＠
At best, she was on par with a homunculus. She may have had the same rights as any human, but nobody had any expectations as far as personality or achievements went where she was concerned.
[k]

＠
A real mage like Wodime must have thought[sr]just having her around was good enough.
[k]

＠
I agreed, of course. Neither me, nor Daybit, nor Akuta interacted with her more than was strictly necessary.
[k]

＠
Although I think Pepe and Ophelia used to invite her to eat with them, saying she was one of the girls. It bewildered her more than anything.
[k]

＠
...Even so, Team A needed her.
[k]

＠
The other members all had an abundance of strengths besides their ability to Rayshift.
[k]

＠
But not me. There was only ONE thing I had.
[k]

＠
All I could do was cling to the lucky coincidence that I just happened to be able to command high-quality Servants.

That's just as true even if you're bad at other things.

[charaFace A 9]

＠Peperoncino
So the only thing YOU, my friend, need to worry about is how you make that destiny YOURS! Once you do that, Kadoc, you'll be well on your way!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Peperoncino
Me? Oh, don't you worry about me one bit.[sr]Destiny and I have always been on the outs.

But you? You're just getting started. Think about it:[sr]the first line of protection for humanity itself!

＠Da Vinci
I mean, I'm one of the good ones.[sr]You know what I'm talking about, don't you?

A true mage is so caught up in their own thoughts and craft that they don't even see people as people anymore.

Oh, yes. That girl is off getting treated in Da Vinci's ICU, so she can transform into a Servant.

＠Goredolf
Given how close we are to enemy territory, there's no telling when they might try to attack the Border!
[k]

＠Goredolf
So I suggested she go and prepare for battle, just in case. Even if she can't fight on the front lines, she can at least stand in front of me and hold a shield!

...[%1], Goredolf is right. Ms. Kyrielight is receiving a tune-up of sorts from Ms. Da Vinci as we speak.

＠Holmes
Ms. Kyrielight was most insistent upon it. She said she wished to fight as a Servant in the event that circumstances called for it.
[k]

If all goes well there should be no issue whatsoever, so please, focus your efforts on rescuing Ms. Atalante.
[k]

＠Holmes
Personally, even if she is able to transform again, I still have no plans to include her in our combat ranks.
[k]

＠Holmes
Nor do I have any intention of sending a Servant out to the front lines when her output has dropped so dramatically.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Holmes
I will only send one there if I am certain they[sr]are capable of seeing their mission through.
[k]

＠Holmes
...Even if that means stopping her from rushing to your aid while you are in a dire predicament.

＠Holmes
Do you understand? Then do please focus on the task at hand, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].

Of them, we must be especially wary of one in particular. No, not the priest, nor Koyanskaya, nor Anastasia, nor Ivan the Terrible.
