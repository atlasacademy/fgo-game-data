＠A：Koyanskaya
Hmmm, I see. So they're going after faith...the Achilles' heel of every god that shows themselves before mortals.
[k]

＠A：Koyanskaya
How delightfully cold-blooded.[sr]It could be just the surgical strike they need.
[k]

[charaFace A 29]

＠A：Koyanskaya
Even if they don't have time to pull it off,[sr]it's certainly making things more interesting!
[k]

＠A：Koyanskaya
A god that nobody believes in is little more than a doomsday device, and one even ordinary people can destroy at that.
[k]

[charaFace A 28]

＠A：Koyanskaya
Still, I have to wonder...
[k]

＠A：Koyanskaya
Are they aware that everything they're doing may, ironically, speed up the whole paradise without people living here?

You've been taking things Arjuna erased along with their owners at the end of the Kali Yuga...

I was under the impression that I was doing exactly what your god would want me to.

There's nothing wrong with rooting out people holding on to unnecessary attachments to their defective past lives.

＠Koyanskaya
Granted, I won't deny I enjoy the look of despair they get when they realize they can't even remember who they lost...
[k]

[charaFace B 17]

But the point is, I'm helping to find undesirables so we can end the yuga cycles ahead of schedule.

I don't care how you get your kicks, but it's hard not to be pissed at how much more work you're making for me.

＠Aśvatthāman
It'd be one thing if you were just defectively getting in the way, but now that you're making this much trouble for us, I was told to handle you directly.

The particulars aside, it should be exactly in line with what Arjuna wants!

[charaFace B 24]

＠Koyanskaya
Your thickheaded god who's so drunk on his Divinities that he's forgotten what human feelings are SHOULD be complimenting me like:

“What an incredibly capable woman you are! You're the goddess I've been searching for my whole life!”

Your Alter Ego friend told Arjuna all about how your actions are directly fueling the resistance movement that has been gaining traction.

That's really the one bit where I sympathize with you.[sr]It sucks having your friends sell you out.

Now I see what's going on here.[sr]So that's how the monk wants to play this.

＠Koyanskaya
What an ugly, petty man. That's the difference he'll never make up between him and the other onmyouji.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Putting aside the question of whether it's more trouble to deal with an arrogant bastard who'd knowingly keep a deadly parasite around just because he can...
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_90 1.5]

＠Koyanskaya
...or a rotten parasite himself who will try to murder you outright in an ambush...

A mere Servant, thinking he can kill me?[sr]The idea is so infuriating it's almost depressing.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
He calls himself a destroyer, just because he was able to take out the other gods and order around a few regent Servants? Ridiculous.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I would never lay down and die for a being who can't even truly become a pure destroyer of worlds, let alone one of his pathetic lackeys.
[k]

[charaFace B 27]

＠Koyanskaya
That emperor who embodied all of humanity was one thing, but I can destroy a mere warrior like you with just a few bites!

Fine by me! Go ahead and get as mad as you want! I'm pretty furious that I've gotta put an end to someone I have no desire to kill!

As your friend must have put it, Arjuna's all we need to end this world... There's no room for a walking disaster like you here!
