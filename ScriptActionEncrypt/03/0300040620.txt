And that Nezha only stopped fighting you guys because tracking me down was a higher priority?

The one thing I can say for sure is that there's a very good reason why you all need to get out of here as fast as you possibly can.

If that's still not enough to convince you, then I'll have to resort to clichés instead of logic.

Confidence is hugely important, you know. It's just like hunting. It's a bad idea to work too hard when you're confident in your position.
