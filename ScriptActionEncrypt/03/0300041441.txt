He must be using the wind god's power to control their flight path. We can't even tell where he's firing from.

This must be what it is like to be a cornered animal,[sr]but we can't let him bring us down.

It bears asking, I think... Can you draw his fire toward you like you did before?

I don't think so. The situation is too different.

I see. I'm not sure why that is,[sr]but I'm glad to hear it all the same.

At least now, we won't have to rely on a cowardly strategy where you end up hurt...

...and all I can do is stand back and watch,[sr]angry at myself for being so helpless.

I have to say though, that's pretty[sr]impressive for a homemade crossbow.

Even so, you shouldn't go around[sr]firing it at a real hunter.
