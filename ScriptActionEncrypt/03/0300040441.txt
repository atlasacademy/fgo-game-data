So I guess I can at least hear you out. 'Specially since it doesn't look like Karna's gonna give up anytime soon.

＠Ganesha
Why was I summoned?[sr]Believe me, I've been asking myself the same question.
[k]

＠Ganesha
I think it was kind of a “You have been choseeen” deal? Like, the Ganesha inside me showed up and said something like:
[k]

[charaFace A 5]
＠Ganesha
“Save the world, hero of the digital realm... If diversity is Proper Human History's greatest strength, then even someone like you can do this...”
[k]

＠Ganesha
“Now is the time for you to spread your wings... And since this is a request from my mother, not doing so is not an option...”
[k]

＠Ganesha
"Be warned: If you fail to save the world,[sr]you will never return to the way you were..."
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Ganesha
So, yeah, Ganesha seems to be a pretty nice god,[sr]and he's definitely an Indian one at heart.
[k]

＠Ganesha
Oh, and don't bother asking me about my class.[sr]I'm not quite sure what it is, either.
[k]

＠Ganesha
I think that might be 'cause Ganesha found me through some sort of devilish intermediary or something?

At any rate, it seems pretty clear that the Counter Force summoned her here automatically.

So it seems like a safe bet that[sr]she'll end up joining our side.

If it were up to me, I'd be demanding an explanation from him and requesting he choose someone else immediately.

＠Ganesha
Anyhoo, even if I don't like it, I figured now that I'm here, there must be something I'm meant to do.
[k]

＠Ganesha
So I took a look around and happened upon that town, but it couldn't have been more idyllic. We're talking “THIS is what world peace looks like” peaceful.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Ganesha
Even a shut-in like me couldn't help but admire the fields of flowers and find this world beautiful.
[k]

＠Ganesha
So I figured there was nothing for me to do after all, and Ganesha must've messed up and sent me to the right place at the wrong time or something.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Ganesha
So I came back here and've been enjoying my lazy NEET life ever since.
