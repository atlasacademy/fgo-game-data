...Listen close.[sr]Once we make our way into their base...
[k]

＠Napoleon
...the best case is we find the Paper Moon and info about the tree without any trouble, but we can't count on that being the case.

[charaFace C 10]

＠Napoleon
For one thing, the queen's gonna know we're there,[sr]and we CANNOT take her on alone. Period.
[k]

＠Napoleon
She's a goddess who's held on to her power since the Age of Gods. The embodiment of nature itself. Can't even get a good read on her magical energy.

We won't have a chance against her unless we take some special steps. That's how strong she is.

She's like a big ball of pure mercy. She really,[sr]truly loves everyone, human and Heroic Spirit.

Once she decides not to kill someone, she won't. She might talk about killing her enemies, but honestly, there's just no one who can threaten her.

[charaFace C 10]

＠Napoleon
That's how it went with me. She couldn't even be bothered to fight me, no matter how many shots I fired at her. I may as well have been a fly.
[k]

＠Napoleon
She'll never bother with sounding alarms, putting out garrisons, or anything like that. The fact that it's still business as usual around here is proof of that.
