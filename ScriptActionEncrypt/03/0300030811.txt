Hostiles eliminated...[bgm BGM_EVENT_70 0.1][sr]The battle is over.

Now these people can rest in peace...[sr]I'd like to think they can, at least.

What is it, Sir Detective?[sr]Have you noticed something?
[k]

＠Holmes
Hmm. Master [%1], how did[sr]this latest battle feel to you?
[k]

？1：I thought I saw some weird tattoos on those Krichat'...

Yes. Those markings were so odd that I can't form a clear picture of them in my mind, but I did see them.

＠Holmes
Ah, pay those no mind. Their behavior is what concerns me... In particular, the fact that they were clearly trained for combat.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Holmes
And not combat with other animals...but with humans.
[k]

？2：They did seem to be more coordinated than they should...

I agree. The Krichat' we fought in the Russian Lostbelt never behaved like this.
[k]

＠Mash
These were weaker individually, but had a sort[sr]of cunning and intellect to make up for it.

？！

＠Holmes
Their loss of strength is almost certainly due to the change in environment. For creatures accustomed to cold, even this weather must seem oppressively hot.
[k]

＠Holmes
Still, they were working as a team. Not like a pack[sr]of wild animals, either...but a trained unit.

Then someone had to have gone[sr]to the trouble to train them...

It's early yet to be certain,[sr]but yes, it does seem likely.

Do you think Koyanskaya is behind this?

If she is, that would raise its own questions.[sr]Namely, when did she have time to do so?

[charaFace E 1]

＠Jing Ke
He might not look like it, but his purpose was always to protect the weak. Once he believes someone needs protecting, he will do anything to keep them safe.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Jing Ke
Of course, that often ends in him sacrificing anyone and everyone to do so... I guess that's a Berserker for you. They're nothing if not committed.
