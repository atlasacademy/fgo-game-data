Whoa! I've never seen anything like that before...!
[k]

＠Napoleon
The whole palace is on fire!
[k]

＠Fou
Fooou, fou!
[k]

＠Mash
The whole building looks like it's made of ice,[sr]and there's a wall of fire surrounding it...
[k]

＠Mash
The fire here is just like the fire in the ice mountains; it's not melting anything around it... Like it is just suspended in the air and not burning anything at all...

This fire is definitely made with magecraft. Nothing else could keep it burning without melting the ice palace.
[k]

[charaFace C 10]

＠Napoleon
Maybe there's a rune of burning inscribed somewhere? Or maybe the fire was brought here from a nearby mountain...
[k]

＠Napoleon
Whatever the case, it makes for a hell of a Bounded[sr]Field. I can feel it tingling on my skin all the way from here...

＠Napoleon
But, that only makes sense! Of course Mt. Galdhøpiggen, the highest summit in Scandinavia, would have a fiery fortress on top of it!
[k]

＠Napoleon
We are trying to bust out a goddess who could be the key to turning everything around here, after all!
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Napoleon
It'll take more than a barrier of magecraft[sr]flame to turn this Heroic Spirit away!

Please be careful, Napoleon![sr]I think this is the Palace of Fire!
[k]

＠Mash
Both in the poem “Sigrdrífumál” of Poetic Edda...
[k]

＠Mash
...and the Völsunga Saga...
[k]

＠Mash
...mention a palace on the top of Mt. Hindarfjall surrounded by a fiery hedge made from the shield of the gods!
[k]

＠Mash
It was called the Palace of Fire.[sr]It's a Bounded Field created by Odin himself!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠Mash
This could be a large-scale ritual that uses magecraft taken from mythology, or perhaps a Bounded Field that's been in place since the Age of Gods!

Hmm?

＠Napoleon
Those flames, the shield of the gods? Nah. This Bounded Field hasn't been here since the Age of Gods.
[k]

[charaFace C 11]

＠Napoleon
At best, it's an imitation[line 2]a bit of fancy magecraft that just looks the part. Use those baby purples of yours, mademoiselle.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]

＠Napoleon
I know your senses are dulled from the magical energy in the snow and fire around here, but look closer.
[k]

＠Napoleon
There they are inside the fire, plain as day!

Now I see them... Those are Muspel giants,[sr]just like the ones at the castle!

I could tell they were stronger than the Jötnar or Bergrisar, but now...there's several of them...

＠Napoleon
I don't see anything wrapped up like before, but given how their legs are in chains, I'm guessing they're here on guard duty?

[charaFace C 4]

...Maybe the queen's just into that sort of thing.[sr]Or maybe...could it be Ophelia? Truly?

Whatever these guys have going on, it's in very poor taste, considering the old Jötunheimen highlands of myth weren't exactly the place to be for the likes of them!

If there's one thing these Muspel over there are lacking,[sr]it's charm! Don't you agree, fire giants!?
