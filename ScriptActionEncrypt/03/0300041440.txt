Father fell asleep after I took him to the healer...[sr]That means he'll be okay, right...?

＠Asha
I wonder if...there's something I can do to help...

＠Tell
Actually, that's about the distance I prefer to operate from. Besides, this is the climax of the hunt.
[k]

＠Tell
I can't just pass up a chance like this,[sr]when my quarry's already weak and exhausted.

[charaFace E 1]

＠Tell
A hunter doesn't feel bad about bringing[sr]down their prey. We feel accomplished.

We are in a difficult position, having fought so many kali and Asclepius. I would much rather we had time to recover before our next showdown with William Tell.

I'm sure you'd like that, but the thing about hunters is that we don't let our quarry escape.

＠Tell
Traps, wind, climate, scents, bait... When we decide to bring down a target, we make sure to use whatever it takes.

＠Tell
And if we let a wounded animal get away,[sr]well...there's no greater shame than that.

[charaFace E 1]

＠Tell
When that happens, we just have to accept it's god's will, and resign ourselves to going to bed with an empty stomach.

Well, at least we don't have to worry about him sniping at us from extreme range now...

...but he can still control the wind as he likes thanks to Vāyu.

＠Peperoncino
Keep your guard up, [%1]. There's no[sr]telling how he'll try shooting his arrows at us next!
