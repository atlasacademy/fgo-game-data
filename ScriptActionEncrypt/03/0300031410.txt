Right. I don't see dropping chunks off of the Great Wall as something that gets done often or in rapid succession.

...Our biggest problem is how Qin Shi Huang can keep tabs on us from the Great Wall. How many of Da Vinci's Bounded Field devices do we have?
[k]

＠Mash
She gave Senpai and me one each,[sr]and we also have a single backup unit.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
Then we should split up in three directions.

The main group will go after the Shadow Border, and the other two will take the villagers somewhere safe.

Fortunately, that the emperor can only look straight down may be our saving grace.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
All that is needed to avoid such a gaze is something overhead, like a cave or a forest thick with foliage.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
We won't know how well the camouflage devices work until we give them a shot.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
And of course, if Qin Shi Huang loses sight of us, then I expect someone will come searching at ground level.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
So we can expect the nearby areas to be crawling with those mechanical soldiers.
