The rebel army, hm? I remember hearing them mentioned before. I presume they are a group who takes issue with Ivan the Terrible's reign?

Sometimes it was nobles fighting, sometimes[sr]it was normal folk who'd run out of food.

But whoever it is, it almost always ends with the Oprichniki slaughtering them. Though nowadays it sounds like they're still putting up a good fight.

They say their leader's a lady archer who still looks like one of the old humans, before Ivan's reign began.

For that matter, even if we weren't able to keep the summoning ritual perfectly secret, I doubt there is anyone in this Russia who could decipher it.

That said, it seems there are still many things we have yet to learn about this strange land.

Now then, where to begin... Before we discuss matters further, why don't I show you what I am capable of?
