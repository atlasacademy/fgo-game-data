Let's begin with your present circumstances.

＠Koyanskaya
Hmm, well, you know how bands sometimes split up because of creative differences? It's a lot like that. I think Peperoncino there can attest to it.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I never liked this one much to begin with, and was planning to wash my hands of him once he'd served his purpose, but he ended up beating me to the punch.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
He filled Arjuna's ears with all sorts of nonsense about me, and now I'm officially persona non grata in this India.
[k]

[charaFace C 20]

＠Koyanskaya
That said, I never had much of an opinion about this Lostbelt to begin with, so I'm not too broken up that I've been exiled from it now...
[k]

[charaFace C 22]

But for the time being, I think I'll stick around a while longer. Let's just say I have my reasons.

[k]

＠Peperoncino
My goal as a Crypter is to grow my Tree of Emptiness, and I certainly haven't abandoned it.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
I'm not on bad terms with anyone from Team A, and I have no intention of defying the Foreign God either.

[charaFace G 0]

[charaFace G 9]

＠Peperoncino
...are you Alter Egos. I mean, how could I?[sr]You're all the definition of shady.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
It's because I have my doubts about you three that I shared the information I have with [%1].
[k]

But of course, I allowed it, as I could tell you were doing so from a place of fairness rather than malice.
[k]

＠Holmes
Given the current state of the world, it doesn't take much thought to realize this fatal contradiction.
[k]

＠Holmes
The fact that Ms. Koyanskaya is here right now only further serves to reinforce it.
[k]

＠Holmes
While I do feel as though I already have a firm grasp on the answer, I also feel as though it would be improper for me to be the one to explain it.
[k]

＠Holmes
So, as one of those directly involved...

Let me be clear: this world is headed towards oblivion. The way it's being run now, it can't possibly end up at anything halfway decent.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Once it's completely purged of “evil,” we're not gonna have the perfect world he's aiming for. We'll be left with a world of total nothingness.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
It's fair to say that Arjuna has[sr]gone completely off the rails.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Peperoncino
But the bigger problem...is that you Disciples aren't doing anything to stop him.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
If anything, that treacherous snake of a man[sr]is pushing him to hurry things along. Why?
[k]

＠Peperoncino
The way things are going now, both this Lostbelt and its Tree of Emptiness will be lost forever. So why aren't you two trying to stop that?
