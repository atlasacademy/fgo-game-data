I know I brought this up earlier too, but...it just doesn't feel right jumping over the gate.

It's a symbol of peace and protection for everyone in this village, after all...

We Servants are strong enough that we could bust right through it, bolt and all, if we pushed hard enough...but that would no doubt be a lot worse.

＠Napoleon
Besides, you know...

＠Napoleon
It would be weird for us to just come up and knock in the middle of the night after we picked a fight with the envoys...

[charaFace G 0]So if those are our choices,[sr]I don't have a problem sneaking in!
