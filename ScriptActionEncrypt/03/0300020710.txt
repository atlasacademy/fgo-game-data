Those birds are back...
[k]

＠Mash
Does that mean we're near another one of those patches of land between ice and fire?
[k]

＠Mash
I don't think we saw any birds around Gerda's village.[sr]Given what she said, animals are pretty rare here.
[k]

＠Mash
Since they have fish in the village pond,[sr]they may be more used to aquatic life.
[k]

＠Napoleon
Huh, you don't say.[sr]So you two can see those birds too.
[k]

？1：Huh?
？2：Is there a reason we wouldn't...?

？！


＠Napoleon
It's a good thing.[sr]Those birds are a good sign for us.

...It was indeed a castle.[sr]A lonely, solitary castle.

＠
At a glance, you could tell it was meant as a home for someone important. A castle of snow and ice, clearly made for royalty.
[k]

＠
It had nothing in the way of defenses as a fortress might. The first and most important consideration in its design had plainly been beauty.
[k]

＠Mash
If we were still in Proper Human History, this castle would be considered an architectural masterpiece.
[k]

＠Napoleon
Well, here in this Lostbelt, it's the largest building around, not that that's exactly a high bar to clear.
[k]

＠Napoleon
A castle of ice and snow.[sr]A kind of temple, where a real-life god resides.
[k]

＠Napoleon
The one and only castle in this whole Lostbelt, standing tall in the northern part of the Oslo Fjord in the Scandinavian Peninsula[line 2]Oslo in Proper Human History.
[k]

＠Napoleon
I'll say this: it sure looks like a place where the ruler of this icy land would live.
[k]

＠Fou
Fou, fo fou.
[k]

＠Mash
How do we get in?
[k]

＠Napoleon
Through the back.

＠Napoleon
You've probably figured it out by now, but this isn't my first time here. I tried breaking in once before.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Napoleon
As you can imagine, it didn't go particularly well.
[k]

[charaFace B 11]

＠Napoleon
But it wasn't all for nothing, right? I may not have left with much in the way of spoils, but I got info.
[k]

？1：You mean you went in alone!?
？2：A man famous for leading an army went in alone?

？！

[charaFace B 6]

＠Napoleon
Damn straight!

[charaFace B 8]

＠Napoleon
I know what Heroic Spirits are supposed to be like in my head, but it's hard to put into practice.
[k]

[charaFace B 10]

＠Napoleon
It's not like I was overly confident in my power or anything... I was mostly just curious to see how far I could go.
[k]

＠Napoleon
Plus, I had a few reasons for doing it. I might not've taken any of them down, but I did learn a few things.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Napoleon
One of them was this underground passage[sr]leading to the castle's main building.
[k]

＠Napoleon
If you just walk across the big bridge up top, you get swarmed by a mountain of envoys... Guess it's just in their nature...

Down below is much easier.[sr]Not nearly as heavy security down there.
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠Napoleon
Yeah, I figured this'd be the case. She didn't increase security after I broke in. So, must mean she doesn't see me as an enemy.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Napoleon
...But she definitely knows we're here. That's just who she is.
[k]

＠Napoleon
She's the real deal; there's no telling how strong she might be. Be ready to face her when we get up to the castle, 'cause I promise you, she'll be waiting.
