＠Da Vinci
Let's start with something simple. In this case, I think it's got to be defining exactly what a yuga is.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Yugas might be a pretty well-known concept, but it's still important to make sure we're all on the same page.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Plus, talking about it might help us figure out what the differences are between our concept and Asha's concept.
[k]


＠Da Vinci
So, first off, does everyone here know what yugas are in our world?

＠Captain
Yugas are a Hindu concept that says the world is always cycling between four distinct periods.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]

＠Captain
In order, those periods are called Kṛta[line 2]or Satya[line 2]Yuga, Tretā Yuga, Dvāpara Yuga, and Kali Yuga.
[k]

＠Captain
When the Kali Yuga draws near, law, order, and morality cease to exist, and the world starts to fill up with evil instead.
[k]

[charaFace H 6]

＠Captain
Then, when the Kali Yuga ends...
[k]

＠Captain
...the gods are said to destroy the world, remake it, and let a new Kṛta Yuga begin all over again.

Once we destroy this Lostbelt...

＠Mash
...she and Ajai are going to disappear, just like the people we met in the other ones...

＠Holmes
From a purely pragmatic perspective, maintaining good relations with the locals will facilitate our information gathering efforts.
[k]

＠Holmes
I suppose the only advice I can give is to not think about it too much.

＠Karna
I did as you instructed, Master. Asha walked straight back to town, and is now safe and sound in her home.
[k]

？1：Thanks, Karna.
？2：I appreciate it!
？！

＠Karna
I kept an eye out for kali on the way there and back, but didn't see a single one.
[k]

＠Karna
However, I can't say for certain whether that is because they had just attacked, as Asha said, or if it was merely a coincidence.

＠Rama
Well, it won't be long before we face them again. And that gives us all the more reason to bolster our forces.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Rama
So let us be off to this mountain where the god lives.
[k]

＠Rama
I wonder what sort of god they are. It would certainly be nice if it turns out to be one we know, just to save time.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Rama
Of course, I'm hoping that it will be Sita!
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Rama
She's the avatar of Lakshmi, so she could easily have ended up being treated as a god in her own right.

＠Karna
I hope you will be reunited with her as well...but there is no guarantee this Servant will even be an Indian god.
[k]

＠Karna
They are just as likely to turn out to be a god from the West, or some other region altogether.
[k]

＠Karna
The odds of our encountering a familiar face are really quite slim.
[k]

＠Karna
Just try not to get your hopes up too high...
