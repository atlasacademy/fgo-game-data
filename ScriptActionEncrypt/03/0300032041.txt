Excellent![sr]That's what I like to hear!
[k]

＠Sion
And from the tone of [%1]'s lovely[sr]voice, it sounds like you completed your mission handily.
[k]

＠Sion
Great work, everyone. Now, I bet you could[sr]all use a nice, hot shower, correct?
[k]

＠Sion
Then I suggest you head west about ten kilometers from your current position. Captain's on his way now.
[k]

＠Sion
Once you meet up with him, you can Zero Sail over to the Wandering Sea before the other Crypters spot you.

Of course. Now that the Lostbelt's gravitational field has collapsed, my calculations and Captain's nav skills will have you back here before you know it.

＠Sion
Oh, but keep in mind that this method is strictly for getting between places that exist in THIS world[line 2]I can get you to the entry point of a Lostbelt and back, but I cannot get you in! Think of this as the world's most advanced airport shuttle!

Once you're all rested up, I'm going to have you head out on your next Order, Lostbelt No. 4...

...where you will investigate a strange Lostbelt that has been repeatedly expanding and contracting.

Moreover, the Captain will be joining in on your adventure into a dazzling realm of Indian mythology!
