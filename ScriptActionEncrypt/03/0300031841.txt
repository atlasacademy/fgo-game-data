Our world truly achieved lasting peace.[sr]It should have been the one to survive.

But now, it will be just another corpse you tread across on the way to your destination.

Tell me... What sort of bloody future do you see past the mountain of bodies you are piling up...?

In the end...all I ever did to bring[sr]about peace was take up my spear...

Then it is time for us to face Chaldea.

This is not the end. They can never hope to conquer the empire without first conquering us.

＠Qin Shi Huang
Meanwhile, you need serve as our advisors no longer. Qin Liangyu has already given everything she has.

So as of this moment, we are relieving both[sr]of you of duties. You have served us well.

Tell us, Han Xin. If we had ordered you to crush Chaldea, even if it meant destroying all of Xianyang...

...surely you could have come up[sr]with at least a dozen viable plans?

＠Qin Shi Huang
If you had been willing to stop at nothing, even the destruction of our nation, in order to secure victory, then you would certainly have prevailed. Are we wrong?
