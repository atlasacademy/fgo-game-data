＠Qin Shi Huang
Then it is your belief that the other Chaldeans will next show themselves at the prison?
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
They will do this, you believe even though their most crucial asset, the Shadow Border, is already on its way to Xianyang?

I do. Difficult as it may be to believe, they are quite thoroughly shackled by their absurd morality.
[k]

＠Akuta Hinako
If forced to choose between people and assets, they will always ignore the big picture in favor of life, even if it creates more danger for them.

Well, if you feel you are that certain,[sr]we will not attempt to dissuade you.

＠Qin Shi Huang
We do not know what trick they[sr]have employed to elude our sight...
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
...but we have received reports of figures matching their description fighting near Ankang.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
Very well. We will permit you to remain at that facility. You may even command the guards should the need arise.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
However, Kuaiji Zero will not go with you. We are assigning him to guard Xianyang, as the Shadow Border is our top priority.

True. In our world, keeping enemy prisoners[sr]separate is only sensible in warfare.
[k]

＠Akuta Hinako
For one thing, you don't want to risk[sr]them working together and escaping.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Akuta Hinako
But Qin Shi Huang is more concerned about keeping all the empire's enemies in one place than the threat of them banding together.
[k]

＠Akuta Hinako
If you think of your enemies as carriers of a disease, it makes sense to keep them isolated in a single location.
[k]

＠Akuta Hinako
Especially since that way the emperor can wipe them all out at once if necessary.

They've founded and destroyed more civilizations than I can count and never once did they learn anything from it.

Not at all. Emotions are looked down upon only because they are fleeting and fickle.

But your feelings have not wavered one bit, even across time itself. You have conviction, not emotion.
