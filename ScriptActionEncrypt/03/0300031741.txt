...The near future revealed itself before him.[bgm BGM_EVENT_70 0.1 0.5]
[k]

＠
He could feel the looming threat of war draw near, slowly but surely, from beyond the peaceful city.
[k]

＠
He could see the palace's defenses[sr]growing more robust by the day.
[k]

＠
Even without visiting Epang Palace for himself, his predictive calculations warned him of the inevitable conflict to come, and its inescapable result.
[k]

＠
...Xianyang was going to fall.

＠Xiang Yu
Even knowing that, you would still[sr]tell me not to take up arms?
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
Defending Xianyang is no longer your job.

＠
But the real problem was the future that followed.
[k]

＠
Usually, he could learn small details about the futures he saw, even if he couldn't always make sense of them.
[k]

＠
But now? He couldn't see anything at all.[sr]Not even a vague fragment of a future possibility.
[k]

＠
It was as though, several years from now,[sr]this very world would no longer even exist.

＠Xiang Yu
Yu...

[charaFace B 7]
＠Yu Mei-ren
Your ability to see the future has toyed with you for too long. No one should have to carry responsibility for history on their shoulders as you have.
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
You have long since earned the[sr]right to lay down that burden.
[k]


＠Xiang Yu
You mourn my fate so deeply? Rather, the fate of the Xiang Yu who paved the way for this Liu Bang to follow?
[k]


[charaFace B 4]
＠Yu Mei-ren
...
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
My place in the empire is not one of peace. Seeing the manner in which this body has been optimized for warfare should make that clear.
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
Yes, I was originally designed to be a civil servant.
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
But my ability to see the near future proved to be most useful on the battlefield.
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
When Qin Shi Huang had only just united all of China, there were still foreign nations in need of being brought to heel.
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
I traveled to Europe, Africa, the New World...every land under the sun, all to make them part of Qin Shi Huang's territory.
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
I must have shed more blood in the course of that conquest than this other Xiang Yu who was known as the Hegemon-King of Western Chu.
[k]


[charaFace B 0]
＠Yu Mei-ren
But here, your conquests were rightly held in high esteem, and the empire valued you accordingly.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]
＠Yu Mei-ren
However, in Proper Human History,[sr]your reputation was...horrific...
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
Well, that is understandable.
[k]

＠
It made sense that history would view[sr]him as a horrible, bloodthirsty monster.
[k]

＠
History is the collected recollections of humanity, so it is only natural for them to view an inhuman machine in such terms.
[k]

＠
If such a device were to be mistaken for human, and its deeds recorded as such, it is no surprise that they would be feared.
[k]

Not one person in all of Proper Human History ever truly understood why you did what you did.

You are wrong about that, Yu.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]
＠Yu Mei-ren
...?
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
I know for a fact that there was one person who understood the Hegemon-King of Western Chu, your Xiang Yu.
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
You, the one who just told me of this other version of myself. Surely you must have understood him.
[k]

[charaTalk A]
At long last, he saw he had been overlooking something so terribly obvious.
[k]

＠
[charaTalk A]
By always casting his gaze to the distant horizon,[sr]he had missed what was right there in front of him.
[k]

＠
[charaTalk A]
There was another person there in the same time and place as Xiang Yu. Another who looked human, yet was feared and despised as inhuman.
[k]

＠
[charaTalk A]
Just as Xiang Yu was feared and despised for quelling all threats to the empire...
[k]

＠
[charaTalk A]
...this immortal Zhenren must have never known either understanding or acceptance.
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
So that is why you have wandered for so long in search of me... How unspeakably tragic.
[k]

It is all in the past now; it is no more than a fleeting dream. There is no sense looking back.

＠
From Xiang Yu's perspective, she was not one to view with suspicion, but wonder. There was neither fear nor hatred in his gaze.
[k]

＠
If anything, her way of life was something to aspire to[line 2]something beautiful to behold.
[k]

＠
But this insight was one only he could have,[sr]and only because he was not human.
[k]

＠
To humans with short lives and limited perception,[sr]she must have seemed as terrible as a demon king.
[k]

＠
But as a pair so far removed from humanity, Xiang Yu and Yu Mei-ren could find solace with each other.
[k]

＠
Indeed, each was the other's perfect companion.
[k]


＠Xiang Yu
...So the Xiang Yu in Proper Human History died,[sr]leaving you alone?
[k]

[charaTalk A]
And yet, with his ability to see the future...Xiang Yu must have known what awaited Yu in his absence.
[k]

＠
[charaTalk A]
He must have known she would wander for an eternity, and the hardships she would suffer in solitude.
[k]

＠Xiang Yu
I see... Then I must have grieved for you.
