Fire walked the earth.
[k]

＠
Here in this Lostbelt, a place nearly devoid of life,[sr]a giant strode about the land like a conquering king.
[k]

＠
Onward he walked, never straying from his path towards the Lostbelt's fiery northern mountains.
[k]

＠
He is the king of the giants.[sr]The king of fire.
[k]

＠
The giants that gather at his feet are crushed beneath his heels. The ice beasts drawn to his light are melted in an instant.
[k]

＠
...He is a lofty king.
[k]

＠
Though he may carry me on his shoulder, I am well aware there is no one who can truly be close to him.
[k]

＠
There is nothing else that can view[sr]the world from his great height.
[k]

＠
No... That may not be quite true any longer.
[k]

＠
My Mystic Eye can see it. An enormous tree beyond the fiery mountains, stretching towards the heavens...
[k]

＠
...a figure just as imposing as the king of giants.
[k]

＠
...The Tree of Emptiness.

Gotta say though, I'm disappointed in Queenie here. Can't believe she's just sitting back and letting Surtr get resurrected like this.
[k]

＠Caenis
Then again, she did marry Njörðr, god of the sea, in Proper Human History. Must not be as smart as she pretends.
[k]

[charaFace D 21]

＠Koyanskaya
I'm afraid you have it backwards, Caenis.[sr]Look at it this way.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Surtr was just that much of a blind spot for her. He represented something so antithetical to her worldview that she couldn't conceive of his existence.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
This Lostbelt was finished the moment she lost the ability to consider that much.
[k]

Why do you think it was pruned away? It's like an insect that couldn't even tell that it was being exterminated.

[charaFace C 6]

＠Caenis
Oh? That mean she's just the sort to sit[sr]back and let nature take its course?
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Caenis
Or does she just pity that Crypter?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Koyanskaya
Indeed. I imagine the queen feels compelled to keep herself in check, so as to be responsible with her overwhelming power.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I suppose it's an admirable enough quality,[sr]for a human...
[k]

[charaFace D 17]
