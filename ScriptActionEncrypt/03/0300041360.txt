...and simply ask your opinion, one person to another.

＠Lakshmi
I want to know your honest thoughts, without worrying about what anyone else might think.

...I see.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
So, in the end...this is the only path available to you.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Lakshmi
Outside of this India, Proper Human History...Earth itself has been almost completely destroyed.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_81 1.5]

＠Lakshmi
And to save it, you have no choice but to cut down these Trees of Emptiness...
[k]

？1：...Yes. That's what I'm fighting for.

[charaFace A 9]

＠Lakshmi
Back then, I never thought about[sr]what the future might hold.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
There were only things I had to do, and only one path available to me: the path of fighting to protect my homeland. So that's what I did.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]
＠Lakshmi
I didn't have some larger plan in mind, like driving every last one of the British out of India, or destroying Britain itself...
[k]

＠Lakshmi
The truth is, I never stopped to think[sr]about what the future might hold...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Lakshmi
...though it should have been obvious that, win or lose, there would be more to be done once the war was over.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
Then again, I suppose my options were so limited,[sr]and the path I had to walk so difficult...
[k]

＠Lakshmi
...that I didn't have the luxury of thinking about anything besides what was right in front of me.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Lakshmi
Still, regardless of what the future might hold...
[k]

＠Lakshmi
...if I know the path I'm taking is the right one,[sr]and I know I have to go down it...
[k]

＠Lakshmi
...then that's exactly what I'll do.[sr]I think, deep down, that's just who I am.
[k]

？1：...?
？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Lakshmi
What I'm trying to say is, I'm in no position to judge anyone for the hard choices they have to make under unprecedented circumstances.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Lakshmi
At any rate, I'm glad you told[sr]me what you really think.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
Just knowing that you do feel bad for the people in these Lostbelts is something of a relief.
[k]

？1：So what are you going to do now?
？！


＠Lakshmi
I...still don't like this.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Lakshmi
But, I also have no intention of letting this false god continue to have his way with these people.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
We may ultimately only be putting this problem off until later...but right now, the only way to protect them is to keep doing what I've been doing.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
So that's what I'm going to do.
[k]

？1：I hope this means you'll keep helping us.

...Heh. You're an odd one, aren't you? Not many people could say something like that so readily.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
You know, I have to ask.[sr]Why did you come here when I asked you to?
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Lakshmi
Didn't it occur to you that I might decide to kill you in order to keep these people safe?

You give it some thought, and say...

...you felt the same way she did.

[charaFace A 5]

＠Lakshmi
?
[k]

＠
[charaTalk G]
You go on, ignoring her perplexed expression.
[k]

＠
[charaTalk G]
You say that...
[k]

＠
[charaTalk G]
...just as she called you here[sr]to talk to you person to person...
[k]

Oh, right. There's one more thing I wanted to ask you.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
This isn't to judge or condemn you.[sr]I just want to make sure I understand.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
Is it true that you've erased the people[sr]in three other Lostbelts already?
[k]

？1：...Yes. It is.

[charaFace A 1]

＠Lakshmi
I said that you and I have some things in common, and you've shown me that we have no choice but to walk the same path.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
So, for the time being, nothing needs to change.[sr]I will continue to fight this false god alongside you.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
We may disagree on some things, but right now,[sr]that shared goal is all that matters.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
You may treat me the same as that Peperoncino person. If you think it best to be wary of me, or to get rid of me...then you're free to do so.
[k]

？1：Don't worry, I trust you. Thanks.
