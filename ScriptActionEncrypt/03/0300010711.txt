You mean, you really didn't kill a single one...?[sr]Are you...a Servant...?
[k]

＠Avicebron
Why, yes, I am.

＠Yaga Chief
I see...
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
We have heard of Servants before.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
They say you are monsters from another world, and that you are terribly powerful, despite looking like humans.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
I've even heard that some Servants possess[sr]power great enough to rival the Tsar...
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
...Are you one of them?
[k]

＠Avicebron
No, there is nothing particularly special about me.
[k]

＠Avicebron
I am just a simple scholar and golem keeper. A perfectly ordinary human, as you might find anywhere in the world.

Though I'm afraid we can only spare a little[sr]in the way of food and medical supplies...

＠Yaga Chief
By the way, I trust you'll be delivering your manifesto to the two neighboring villages as well?
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
Let me write you a letter of recommendation. It should help things go more smoothly when you visit them.
[k]

？1：Thank you so much!
？！

[charaFace C 2]

＠Yaga Chief
...Although, I'm afraid we've lost contact with the other two villages recently. They may have been overrun by bandits, or Demonic Beasts.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
If they have, could I ask you[sr]to give them a proper burial?
[k]

？1：Okay. We will.

Now then, let us head to the next village.
