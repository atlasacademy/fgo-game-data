He has been making golems from the various ores that the team comes across while excavating the tunnels, then uses those golems to carry stuff out of the tunnels.

＠Atalante Alter
...For the time being, I think we should focus on building the new stronghold and digging out the tunnel.

We should even have enough to create a spare set of armor. Though of course, it will take some time to excavate all the materials.

Good. Both our new stronghold[sr]and the tunnel are complete.

...We still have some leftover material lying about, but we can leave it be. We'll only be staying at this stronghold for a short while.

＠Atalante Alter
We have camouflaged the other end of the tunnel. Our advance to the capital should begin in about three days.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
...The next step is to contact Beowulf,[sr]and have him and his Yaga create a diversion.
[k]

？1：Then, that means...
？！

[charaFace B 1]

＠Atalante Alter
Yes. It is finally time.

＠Atalante Alter
We will liberate the Yaga of this world from[sr]the Tsar and his Oprichniki's reign of terror.

We're going to make our way into Yaga Moscow itself and defeat Ivan the Terrible!
