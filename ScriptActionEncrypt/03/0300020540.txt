I may be human, but I'm also a Demi-Servant who once possessed the power of a Heroic Spirit...

The sort who is exactly the kind of hero whose soul Valkyries would have desired, at least in Proper Human History.

Given your nature, you can't ignore the remains of that hero inside me. That's why...

This isn't right! It doesn't make sense! We gave them the bouquet, but the envoy never opened the gate!

We can't open it ourselves, right? Gerda did yesterday,[sr]but we can't do that on the ordained day, right?

Amalgam Goad is in good shape.[sr]It should stand up to combat, at a minimum.

＠Mash
It also seems that the envoys view the people of these villages as something to be protected.
[k]

＠Mash
When we fought, it seemed like she didn't want to hurt the people or damage the village.

＠Mash
I'm willing to bet that the next envoys will probably take the same approach...
