...The battle is over.[sr]It looks like that was the last of the seeds.

I never thought the giants would group together to chase after us while the Border was moving, though!

I wonder...were they trying to hold us back, or is it just a coincidence they showed up now? Hmm. I can't imagine they were sent here to stall us, but...

True. I don't sense any real intelligence guiding their actions, though. It may well be that they're not here at either Surtr or the Crypter's command.

You think the seeds came out on their own? Or maybe,[sr]that the Tree of Emptiness itself scattered them?

Yes, that is certainly a possibility. Fascinating. Perhaps these seeds are the Tree of Emptiness's way of defending itself.

I believe you first encountered one while you were in the old Jötunheimen highlands?

That's right.[sr]It was when we were on Mt. Galdhøpiggen.

Hmm. Perhaps it has to do with latitude? If true, that would explain why it responded automatically once you headed north...

It's all right, Sigurd. Strangely enough,[sr]I am comfortably able to control myself...

[charaFace F 8]

＠Brynhild
Maybe it's because...over half my[sr]Spirit Core is already shattered.
[k]

＠Brynhild
I was already broken when I materialized,[sr]so perhaps, by breaking myself further...

＠Brynhild
...I'm better able to resist my usual temptations.

＠Sigurd
How peculiar that becoming Heroic[sr]Spirits has reduced us to this.

＠Brynhild
Not at all, my love.[sr]I'm happy about this turn of events.
