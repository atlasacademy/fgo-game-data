You can't give anything that much effort unless you really, truly believe in what you're doing.
[k]

？1：It didn't matter how many times we defeated him...
？2：He just wouldn't stay down, no matter what...
？！

＠Peperoncino
Right. However much you hurt him, he'll just bounce right back, even if the wound is fatal.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
He was nowhere near so durable when he was with me, so it must be something with the Divinity Arjuna gave him...
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Peperoncino
But at any rate, he didn't even think to pretend he was out of commission so he could take it easy until his wounds finished healing, right? He's as hardcore as they come.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
So I don't think we should get our hopes up about him secretly hating this world and being willing to betray it.

[charaFace D 0]

＠Peperoncino
If anything, he seemed to me like he cared more about serving Arjuna than anything else.
[k]

[charaFace D 7]

＠Peperoncino
Not because Arjuna's his Master now. I got the impression that he's a true believer in what Arjuna's doing.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
He and Arjuna might have been enemies back when they were human, but I'm pretty sure Arjuna is way beyond thinking about the Kauravas and the Pandavas at this point.

I always meant to try and get to know Aśvatthāman better, but I was so busy back when this Lostbelt was first made that I kept putting it off.

There is one story that says he attacked an enemy army in the dead of night out of anger over his father's murder.

Even though that sort of thing was absolutely against the rules of warfare at the time.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Anywho...as a Servant,[sr]he's always been fueled by rage.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
I'm sure there's more to him than that, but his rage burned so hot it seemed like it subsumed everything else.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
In some aspects...you could say[sr]he was a bit socially awkward.
[k]

[charaFace D 7]

＠Peperoncino
But anger's a force to be reckoned with.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Some people think of anger as giving you blinders and making you unwilling to see reason, but on the other hand, that kind of focus can be very powerful.

＠Peperoncino
So the idea of going up against someone so relentlessly devoted to his cause, well...

But you've really gotta give that up, girl. If you don't, you'll just make trouble for yourself, your Master, and us.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
We were all loners well before we were Crypters.[sr]That didn't change just because we joined a group.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Some of us have our own ideals. Some of us have faced major oppression. Some of us are natural rebels. Some of us were born in the wrong place. Some of us have lost our humanity entirely.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
We've all got our own issues, and they don't go away just by being part of a team.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
There was not a good person among us.[sr]Not any of them, and not me either.
[k]

[charaFace D 8]

＠Peperoncino
I mean, we sold out all of mankind and joined forces with the Foreign God just so we could survive, remember?
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Maybe you have a little survivor's guilt at being the only one left, Mashie, but you don't have to feel bad.
[k]

[charaFace D 9]

＠Peperoncino
This was always going to happen to us.

I-I see. I don't quite get what you were talking about, but I can see that you are a man of conviction.

＠Rama
You have quite the keen eye, don't you? I've noticed it helping us in battle since you joined.
[k]

＠Rama
That keenness doesn't seem entirely physical, either.[sr]Is it some sort of magecraft?

Why yes.[sr]It's Divine Power, just like the kind you use, Ramie.

＠Peperoncino
It's a technique I came up with to let me use the power of the gods in my human body.

I'm also pretty good at Jinsokutsu, Tashintsu,[sr]and Rojintsu, I'll have you know.

Those are three of Japan's Shugendou Rokujintsu,[sr]or six supernormal Buddhist powers.
[k]

＠Holmes
Jinsokutsu is the power to run faster than any ordinary human. Tashintsu is the power to read other's minds.
[k]

[charaFace H 4]

＠Holmes
And Rojintsu is... Hmm. My apologies. I do understand the concept, but I struggle to articulate it and make myself understood...
[k]

＠Holmes
It's...something unique to Buddhism, almost an awareness of one's destiny, not dissimilar to enlightenment...

My, my, I'm impressed you know that much about Eastern philosophy! You really are a great detective, aren't you?

[charaFace D 9]

＠Peperoncino
I would say Rojintsu is...the power to know one's self well, maybe? That's as good a way to remember it as any, [%1].
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Of course, I doubt you'll have much use for it,[sr]being Mash's Master and all.

[charaFace D 4]

I mean, knowing that much about yourself?[sr]That's just asking for trouble, right?

？！

＠Peperoncino
Oh my, that's what you're concerned about?[sr]You're awfully bold for such a cutie.
[k]

[charaFace D 9]

＠Peperoncino
It's simple. I ran away from my[sr]country when I was about your age.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Ever since, I've been an international stranger. Chaldea is the first place in my life that I could actually call home.
[k]

？1：Why did you run away...?

？！

＠Peperoncino
Why, because there wasn't anything there for me. I didn't get along with anyone in my family, extended or otherwise.
