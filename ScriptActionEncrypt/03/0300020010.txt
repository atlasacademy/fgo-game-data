The Wandering Sea of Baldanders is the first enigma ever discovered in the world of magecraft, and it will be the last to be puzzled out.

It's an island so mysterious and full of Mystics that even such a gifted mage of an incredibly prestigious bloodline as myself may not even set foot on it!

It's true.[sr]That all fits with what's in Chaldea's database.
[k]

＠Mash
It says that though the Mage's Association has been around since the start of the A.D. era, it also split into three branches shortly after its inception.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
The mages who settled in London evolved with the times, and focused on developing magecraft over the course of history.
[k]

＠Mash
That faction went on to become the Clock Tower, the largest and most powerful magecraft organization in the world.
[k]

＠Mash
Its members include the Animusphere family[line 2]the founders of Chaldea[line 2]and Mr. Goredolf here.

＠Mash
The next major faction is the Atlas Institute in Egypt. They're dedicated to perfecting alchemy.
[k]

＠Mash
We actually infiltrated their headquarters once,[sr]during the Sixth Singularity.
[k]

＠Mash
It was a huge research complex, almost like a giant crypt, built deep underground. And as easy as it was to get in, it was hard to get out.
[k]

＠Mash
The Atlas Institute's ironclad rule is that the technology created there must never leave...
[k]

＠Mash
...but Chaldea's first director was granted[sr]an exemption, thanks to the Atlas Contract.
[k]

＠Mash
The technology he was able to take from the Atlas Institute enabled him to complete Chaldeas.
[k]

＠Mash
It was also the Atlas Institute that presented him with the Void-Reality Observation Device, Paper Moon[line 2]one of the finest Mystic Codes ever made.

And finally, the last faction is the Wandering Sea, the Baldanders, said to be somewhere in the North Sea.
[k]

＠Mash
However, the most I could find about them was a brief overview, even in Chaldea's extensive files.
[k]

＠Mash
It said that their cardinal rule is to only recognize magecraft from the Age of Gods, and refuse to accept any advancements or alterations urged by civilization.
[k]

＠Mash
In essence, their ideology is the[sr]exact opposite of the Clock Tower's.

Indeed. Refusing to accept progress in magecraft means refusing to accept consumer civilization.

＠Holmes
The Wandering Sea's philosophy of magecraft is fundamentally incompatible with modern human society.
[k]

＠Goredolf
That said, they do open their gates just once every year to try and recruit promising new talent...
[k]

＠Goredolf
...but even among mages of the Clock Tower, the number who actually make it to the Wandering Sea can be counted on one hand.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Goredolf
Do you see my point? I'm saying the Wandering Sea is every bit as secretive as the Atlas Institute, just in a different way.

As the name suggests,[sr]the Wandering Sea is always on the move.
[k]

＠Holmes
Most who know of it believe it to be a floating island somewhere in the North Sea, but it is, in fact, the very opposite.
[k]

＠Holmes
The Wandering Sea's headquarters were built before the A.D. era began, and they never move at all. It is instead the sea in which they are located that moves around. A world unto itself in many ways...
[k]

＠Holmes
That is almost certainly why its location still remains a secret even in the twenty-first century.
[k]

＠Holmes
Land that moves around while placing Mystic textures on itself... I see. That would make it its own independent Singularity.
[k]

＠Holmes
It would also explain how it was able to escape whatever turned the earth's surface into an endless white desert.

[k]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]First, there's the small matter of the Wandering Sea living up to its name. These coordinates they sent us are all over the place.[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]...Literally, in fact. They're in a constant state of flux[line 2]nothing definite or precise.[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]With coordinates like these, it would be very risky to try Zero Sailing there with the Paper Moon.[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]So until and unless we go to the Wandering Sea directly and forge some kind of connection to it, a long distance Zero Sail is out of the question.[-]
[k]

[charaFace D 14]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]Second[line 2]and this is the real problem[line 2]we don't have the energy.[-]
[k]

[charaFace D 24]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]Yes, Holmes oh so helpfully suggested converting mana into electricity as if it were a simple matter, but that can only get us so far.[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]The conversion rate isn't efficient enough, so we'd end up spending more power than we can produce, which would make a long Zero Sail trip fatal.[-]
[k]

[charaFace D 17]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]After all, no more power means no more working life-support systems. And I don't know about you guys, but I sure don't want to be out in this bleached white world all by myself.[-]

Foreign God...? Intriguing. Would you be so good as to tell us more, Metropolitan Macarius?

Now then, I'd best be on my way. I hope you won't mind my saving the answer to your question for our next meeting, Sherlock!

[charaFace G 2]

＠Priest
Oh, but before I go, I would at least like to put[sr]a stop to this false name you've been using for me.
[k]

＠Priest
My True Name is Rasputin.[sr]Grigori Rasputin.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

＠Priest
That said, I confess that this Spirit Origin doesn't belong to me. I'm simply borrowing it from a dead man.

I deduced all that long ago, my dear priest.[sr]My concerns are more fundamental in nature.
[k]

[charaFace F 6]

＠Holmes
...Where did you acquire that dead man? In Proper Human History, Kotomine Kirei's body was cremated.
[k]

＠Holmes
So how did you come to take possession[sr]of a dead man without a body?

Oh, I'm sure you'll figure that out sooner or later, Sherlock. That is, after all, what you do.
[k]

[charaFace G 7]

＠Priest
You once called the Incineration of Humanity a[sr]“mythological murder case.”
[k]

＠Priest
In which case, go ahead and label this attack the same way. Ask yourself who committed this crime, and how.
[k]

＠Priest
Once you have arrived at that answer,[sr]we will meet again.
[k]

＠Priest
When that day comes, I look forward to you accusing the culprit in person.

We'll just have to give up on interrogating Kadoc Zemlupus... This was my fault. I should have considered that someone may pursue us.

＠Kadoc
Sneaking up on people and stabbing them is kind of your thing, huh? I think my heart actually stopped for a while back there.
[k]

[charaFace G 7]

＠Priest
Indeed, it did.
[k]

＠Priest
If it hadn't, do you really think Holmes[sr]would have let us escape so easily?
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Priest
No, if he had realized you were still alive, they would have come back to retrieve you. I couldn't let that happen.
[k]

＠Priest
Not after Kirschtaria asked me[sr]to bring you back to Olympus.
[k]

＠Kadoc
...Is that so. Well, it doesn't matter either way.[sr]You wasted your time, Rasputin.
[k]

[charaFace G 8]
＠Priest
Oh?
[k]

＠Kadoc
Whether Chaldea kills me, or Wodime does it,[sr]I'll be just as dead.
[k]

＠Kadoc
Now that I've failed, I don't belong with either of them. I'm just going to be an example to the other Crypters.
[k]

[charaFace G 9]

＠Priest
...

[charaFace C 4]

＠Kadoc
What? What is it? If you've got something to say,[sr]then spit it out, “Father.”
[k]

[charaFace G 10]

＠Priest
Apologies. I was just thinking how much easier my job would be if Kirschtaria was that sort of person.
[k]

[charaFace G 7]

＠Priest
At any rate, it's clear what's going to happen to you.
[k]

＠Priest
You may have lost your right to run a Lostbelt,[sr]but you still have your Sirius Light.
[k]

＠Priest
That Command Spell belongs to our god. As long as you possess it, your life does not belong to you alone.
[k]

＠Priest
You no longer have the option of throwing[sr]your life away, Kadoc Zemlupus.
[k]

＠Priest
Your fate is to have every last bit of your soul squeezed out of you, until the day you die.
