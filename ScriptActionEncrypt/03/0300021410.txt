＠
Why?
[k]

＠
Simple.[sr]I hated myself.
[k]

＠
For me, Sundays were a prison, and I hated how I was never able to escape from them. I could never take that first step.
[k]

＠
I detested how weak I was... How my parents' wishes felt like a curse, leaving me unable to even set foot outside.
[k]

＠
I never even thought about running away.[sr]The idea of leaving never so much as entered my mind.
[k]

＠
Which is why...I was always waiting for someone.
[k]

＠
Someone who would come and save me.[sr]Someone who would let me out of here.
[k]

＠
Someone who would tell me:
[k]

＠
“You don't have to do anything.[sr]You don't have to grant anyone's wishes.”
[k]

I waited for someone like that for so long.

Had my vocal cords still been working, I'm sure I would have gasped to find my eye was seeing the world in the Coffin next to mine.
[k]

＠
I saw a brilliant light shining in pitch darkness,[sr]and Wodime opposite it.
[k]

＠
I had never seen Wodime so childlike before. Not in appearance, mind you, but in his strength[line 2]or rather, the lack of it.
[k]

＠
He was horribly injured and fatigued, to the point that even the effort of breathing seemed likely to kill him.
[k]

＠
It was as if he had seen the end of the world...[sr]No...like he had fought to prevent it.
[k]

＠
He was so bruised and battered that I could almost believe such a ridiculous delusion was actually true...as though he was only alive now through sheer miraculous luck.
[k]

＠???
“We now share our circumstances. This...humanity you come from will be incinerated, and fade away.”
[k]

＠???
“But that is of no consequence to us. It may be unexpected, but not so much as to change our plans.”
[k]

＠???
“The assault has led to the closure of the expanse.[sr]Soon, both you and humanity will meet your end.”
[k]

＠???
“Yet unfortunately, God still has[sr]no body for this joyous feat.”
[k]

＠???
“You'll help me with that, won't you,[sr]Kirschtaria Wodime?”
[k]

＠???
“You are a Crypter, which makes[sr]you perfect to spread my word.”
[k]

＠
...I didn't know what was going on.[sr]All I knew was I could sense our end approaching.
[k]

＠
He had been chosen, and we had not.
[k]

＠
Wodime would go on to survive,[sr]and we would remain trapped in darkness.
[k]


＠Kirschtaria
...No.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
I'm afraid I alone won't be enough. I must strongly recommend that the other six join me to assist.
[k]

＠
I could sense the light's confusion.[sr]Indeed, my own mind all but went blank in shock.
[k]

＠
A god, a human, even a tiny ant crawling along the ground could see how out of line he was.
[k]

＠
It was clear to anyone watching that his remarks, his suggestion, would usually be out of the question.
[k]

＠???
“I don't understand.[sr]Once the world is wiped clean, you will be invincible.”
[k]

＠???
“Why would you want competition when one[sr]of you would be more than sufficient?”
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
I understand that.[sr]But invincibility and omnipotence are not the same.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
There is a nonzero chance that one of the other six may surpass me. As long as that possibility exists, however slight, I will not dismiss it.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
Give them the chance to choose for themselves. There is no point in me rebuilding human history on my own.
[k]

＠
Wodime wasn't proposing that[sr]his responsibilities be shared.
[k]

＠
He believed in our worth as individuals.[sr]It was a shining example of unwavering humanity.
[k]

＠???
“...Restoring what was lost[sr]will take considerable effort.”
[k]

＠???
“Bringing a single human back to life may only take mere moments, but it requires a level of suffering sufficient to stop the entire world in its tracks.”
[k]

＠???
“Consider the hell you just endured as an example.”
[k]

＠???
“What's more, their bodies have sunk into the Void.[sr]They can no longer pay that price themselves.”
[k]

＠???
“Can you pay it for them,[sr]Kirschtaria Wodime?”
[k]


＠???
“Can you withstand the agony that comes with fighting the entire world six more times?”
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
Of course.[sr]If it is humanly possible, then I can do it.
