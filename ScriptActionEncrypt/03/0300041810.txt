No, it's nothing. For a moment, it seemed as though there was something off about the surrounding area... Hopefully, it was nothing more than a momentary sensor malfunction.

Unfortunately, it didn't work. I never thought even the false god would be so heartless as to cast away every person who lost their faith in him.

I should have known better than to hope for even so much as that from him...

You're on the right track.

Taking away Arjuna's god status is almost certainly the only way we'll be able to beat him.

？1：But...
？！

[charaFace C 4]

＠Aśvatthāman
I know, dammit. Obviously, we can't count on the people of this world to help with that anymore.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Aśvatthāman
So then, our only choice is to use something else.[sr]Assuming we even can, anyway.

Ugh, dammit, I really didn't want to bring this up since it's a big whole all-or-nothing deal, and that pisses me the hell off.

＠Aśvatthāman
If we mess it up, we'll all be dead and gone. And even if it works, it'd still only give us a tiny chance of coming out on top.

[charaFace C 4]

You still wanna hear it?

＠Aśvatthāman
...The biggest factor in Arjuna remaining a god and in control of this world is that he's the one advancing the yuga cycle.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
The obvious idea that anyone capable of destroying and recreating the world would have to be a god, only reinforces his position as one.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
So as long as he keeps the yuga cycle going,[sr]he's pretty much a perfect god.

Makes sense. I mean, you'd have to be one helluva god to remake the whole damn world...

Oh crap, that sort of thinking's part[sr]of the problem, isn't it!? Dammit!

If we can defy that world remaking, even just a tiny bit, then he won't be a perfect god any longer.

That's the problem. We can't take the safe or easy way out with something like this.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Aśvatthāman
We'd have to face Arjuna's world[sr]destroying Noble Phantasm head-on...
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
...refuse to disappear, and continue our existence as continuous entities.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
Once we've done that, we'll have proven his fallibility, and really messed up the idea of him as some perfect god.

＠Aśvatthāman
...So that's the plan. An almost suicidal battle of endurance where one wrong move means you're gone for good.

＠Aśvatthāman
How about it?[sr]Anyone here think they can pull that off?
