I've started to get a little bored.

But, I'm still fine. Totally, totally fine.

＠
I can easily use my god powers to make new games or summon existing ones. I've got everything I need here. I can do whatever I want.
[k]

＠
I've got role-playing games, strategy games, sim games, action games, puzzle games, adventure games, shooting games, racing games... I've got fantasy worlds, sci-fi worlds, historical worlds, modern-day worlds...
[k]

＠
Video games are the pinnacle of human civilization. If you get tired of one, you can always move on to another.
[k]

＠
Man, this is so much fun. I love grinding and leveling up. I love looking for rare items.
[k]

＠
And if I run out of things to do, there's no end of different challenge runs to try. The sense of achievement I get from beating those is all the sweeter since I'm just doing them for their own sake. I'm having the time of my life here.
