You all knew about the Yaga suffering in the frontier, yet you still kowtowed to the Oprichniki and told them about the Yaga who had fled.

I understand it is the Yaga way to submit to the strong, and that it is what you must do to survive.

I have heard all about how some Yaga communities have essentially separated into nobility and commoners!

How foolish. In this frigid tundra, any Yaga who does not receive a fair share of food cannot hope to survive!

[charaFace A 2]

Did you honestly think you could form a nobility caste whose only role is to sit around and grow fat!?

＠Yaga Mayor
Y-you misunderstand! We would never think to establish a nobility not sanctioned by the Tsar! All we did was divide our roles.

Weaklings like the old, the sick, and orphans are weeded out, leaving the warriors to protect the city, and the rest of us to keep it running.
