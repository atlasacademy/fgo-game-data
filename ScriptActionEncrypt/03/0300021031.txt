It's still hard to make out magical energy here, but that's not the only unusual thing in the air. Can you smell it?

Oh, now that you mention it...I can faintly make out hydrogen sulfide...

Take another look at the flames, then at the palace.
[k]

＠Napoleon
Does it look like the flames have gone down in intensity at all? Have the palace doors opened up?

I can't find so much as a seam in that Bounded Field! Maybe this means we need to use magecraft to break through it?

＠Mash
Disabling such a powerful Bounded Field[sr]would be a problem for Senpai and me...

Neither of us is able to use[sr]powerful magecraft like that...

Not to mention we still have those guards to contend with.
