I never imagined there would be[sr]that many kali gathered there.

I expected it might be dangerous, but with numbers like that, adding one more to our ranks still won't be enough to fend them off.

I see. That's all ri[line 2]No, I'm sorry.[sr]I was being oversensitive.

...While we're on the subject, this seems a good chance to tell you this. Naturally, I will do everything in my power to accomplish our mutual goal. I have no intention of holding back.

[charaFace I 9]

＠Lakshmi
But I should warn you, for your own safety, you shouldn't expect me to come through when it really counts.

(Well that's a strange opinion to have of oneself. Perhaps her failure to defend her country in life had a traumatic effect on her?)

...Be that as it may, there is no doubt whatsoever that you are far more useful in combat than a detective in a remote location.

At any rate, there really were a ridiculous number of kali there. Lends the impression that it may be even more important to this Lostbelt than we thought.

Indeed. It was as though those kali were there solely to guard the Skyboulder.
[k]

＠Rama
The fact that we can no longer see them after putting just a little distance between us and the Skyboulder would only seem to confirm that.
[k]

＠Rama
I wonder what this could mean...

For that matter, we still don't know what those kali demons actually are.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I'm guessing Holmes is probably right in that they're like a virus infecting this world, in opposition of the sacred beasts...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...but still, we have not the slightest idea what they are, where they come from, or where they go...

＠Peperoncino
I don't know either, but I can say they're not any ordinary kind of creature.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Given that they stick around even after the world is remade, maybe Arjuna uses them as a means to determine who is worth preserving...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...or maybe they just remain here out of necessity.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
If it's the latter, that would mean they're a crucial part of the stage Arjuna uses to run this world.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
So, if we defeat him...maybe they'll all just go poof?
[k]

？1：I guess this means we've just got to figure out what to do about Arjuna...

At least we now know that God's Skyboulder is protected by vast numbers of kali, and can't be approached lightly.
[k]

＠Holmes
It may not be much, but it is more than we knew before.
[k]

＠Holmes
In the meantime, I suggest we return to Dival and plot our next course of action.
