A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Queen of the Scandinavian Lostbelt. My apologies for delivering a recorded message rather than visiting in person.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
I am Kirschtaria Wodime.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
I am in charge of the largest Lostbelt,[sr]Greece, and the leader of the Crypters.

As for you, Chaldeans, welcome to this bleached Earth.[sr]As your “senpai,” I'm proud to welcome you here.

＠Kirschtaria
While I confess that doing so required some speculation on my part, I have taken the liberty of sending this message to the king of Scandinavia with the assumption that you will all be present as well.
[k]

Given how you triumphed in Russia, and how close this Lostbelt lies to it, I am confident you will have reached it by the time this message is delivered.

＠Kirschtaria
Our goal is to rebuild human history.[sr]This entails recreating a land for gods to inhabit.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
Proper Human History was not a mistake per se,[sr]but neither was it correct.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
Instead of loss and gain resulting in a net benefit, they became caught in a system that resulted in unchecked growth for both.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
It was an incredible waste. What should have been a virtuous cycle was effectively stuck in a rut.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
The Foreign God wept to see the state of this planet,[sr]and decided to grace it with their presence.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
As Crypters, our duty is to help the Lostbelts take root and become stronger than Proper Human History.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
The King of Mages' answer to humanity's failure was to have other humans incinerate it, but not me. I choose to rewrite history, with the Foreign God's help.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
People have had gods running the world behind the scenes since ancient times. They believed gods were both the planet itself, and the laws of nature that governed it.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
But humanity lacked self-awareness.[sr]Those laws were meant to be used, not obeyed.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Kirschtaria
It was that mistake that led to[sr]humanity and the gods parting ways.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
Humanity did not forget the gods. They abandoned that possibility once they became unable to handle them.

Your Majesty, Queen of Scandinavia.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
You care for a mythological ecosystem that met its end in a self-imposed ruin, rather than one which ended when its people forgot it, like Greece.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
Keep the Tree of Emptiness safe. As long as it exists,[sr]that Lostbelt will never vanish.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
I implore you to turn your back on your fate, and to choose the path of survival. Once you do that, I would like nothing more than for you to face off against my own Tree of Emptiness.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Kirschtaria
My Tree of Emptiness is already fully grown.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
While the Norse world has Yggdrasil, a world tree that serves as the foundation of its every realm, Greece now has a Tree of Emptiness supporting the very heavens...
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
Thus, it has been dubbed the World Tree Atlas by my[sr]ally, the great god Zeus.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

＠Kirschtaria
Chaldeans, I can say that, as far as you are concerned,[sr]Atlas is your greatest and most important target.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
The roots of my Lostbelt's Tree of Emptiness now cover eighty percent of the earth's surface.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
Even if you succeed at cutting down every other Lostbelt's tree, you will never be able to restore Proper Human History so long as Atlas remains standing.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Kirschtaria
Queen of Scandinavia, you are a god,[sr]and so I have high hopes for you.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
...Indeed, you could even think of this as the gods taking revenge on humans for usurping their throne.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
As for me, I am prepared to make full use of the gods despite being human myself.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
I will create a fully realized Age of Gods. A glorious history where human weakness is a thing of the past.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
It will be a world that will endure no matter how heated human consciousness becomes. A place where life can flourish with neither deficit nor fragmentation.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
Be warned that I will show no mercy to any who would stand in the way of that goal. I hope that, alongside Ophelia, you will choose the best possible future.
