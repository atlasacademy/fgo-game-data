This world's space-time is coming apart at the seams thanks to Arjuna breaking and remaking it over and over.

As a queen, I may have failed to protect my country, and I may have lacked the skill needed to help my people's rebellion succeed...

...but I think that's why I was called here,[sr]as though I were some sort of hero.

I think this world is giving me[sr]another chance to get it right.

It's challenging me to protect the[sr]things I couldn't protect before.

In the end, this is what it all comes down to. I'm gonna be true to myself, obstinate pessimism and all.
[k]

＠
Since there aren't many things I'm good at, I want to at least be decent at the things I'm used to.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠
Once, in a very different time and place...
[k]

＠
...you believed in me completely,[sr]even though you knew I wasn't special.
[k]

＠
So now...even though I'm scared, I've got to act like what I'm about to do is no big deal, just like I usually do.
[k]

Besides, I'm not running away from everything this time. I'm just waiting for someone to come and get me.

[charaFace G 1]

＠Ganesha
Hey, Ganesha? I'm sorry you drew the short straw, getting me as a vessel. But you knew what you were in for, right?
[k]

＠Ganesha
I sure hope so, seeing as you picked the world's biggest NEET and all.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠
Ganesha's the god of prosperity, the god of knowledge...and the god of obstacles, especially removing them.
[k]

＠
And what are obstacles? Obstructions. Things that try to hold us back or stop us from getting where we want to[line 2]where we need to go.
[k]

＠Ganesha
I've always been keenly aware of obstacles. I feel like I've been surrounded by them my whole life.
[k]

[charaFace G 6]

＠Ganesha
So for me, treating the entire outside world like one giant obstacle is as easy as pie.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠
All right, it's time to gather up that power, and solidify it to protect me in my own little world. It's time to make a nice comfy NEET cave to last me a good, long time.
[k]

A completely impenetrable domain that not even a god could hope to pry open.
