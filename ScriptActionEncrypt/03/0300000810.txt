Although many nations have claimed this land as their own, the fact remains that it is the last frontier yet to fall into humanity's grasp.

Chaldea was built right in its center, so that no nation could use it for their own ends.

＠Holmes
It was built on a mountain range hidden by an endless blizzard[line 2]or rather, the lingering scent of Mystics[line 2]and then further reinforced by a Bounded Field.

It is the largest, and only, observatory of humanity on the entire planet, its location and secrets concealed from the moment of its creation.

That is Chaldea, the Security Organization for the Preservation of Humanity. I suppose I ought to say that it WAS Chaldea.

I'm afraid that won't work, Da Vinci.[sr]We're getting no response from the American base.

＠Holmes
In fact, according to the sonar, there is nothing to be found anywhere. Surely you can see that yourself.
[k]

＠Holmes
As long as we remain in Antarctica, we have no chance of victory. If the enemy forces who occupied Chaldea catch up to us, we will be quite finished.
[k]

＠Holmes
Our only hope for survival is to plow through that[sr]mass of soldiers and pray we make it out to sea.

Quite right! This is an adventure,[sr]and one of the grandest ones imaginable at that.

It's certainly not some boring escapade where we[sr]barrel our way through an army of horrific killers.

＠Holmes
No, this will be humanity's first magecraft voyage.[sr]To date, humankind has traveled to the moon, the subterranean world, and even through time.
[k]

＠Holmes
This voyage will be unlike any of those trips,[sr]though no less grand in ambition.
[k]

＠Holmes
The world we hope to visit is one that cannot exist without being defined, even as it lies in a domain beyond our reach.
[k]

＠Holmes
In other words, we will be attempting to travel[sr]to a world that exists on the negative vector.

Thirty percent at best, I should think.[sr]For that matter, I can't even be sure where we'll end up.

If all we wish to do is make it out of this predicament alive, I have no doubt there are better options available.

But, if you have your sights set further than that, this is the one I recommend. I believe it will aid us in fighting this adversary in the future.

＠[51ffff]P.A. System[-]
[51ffff]Although this Phenomenon Intervention Method we're about to attempt is one of the first Chaldea ever devised, we banned its use because of its extreme difficulty and danger.[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]P.A. System[-]
[51ffff]You know how Rayshifting involves breaking a Master down into Spiritrons and outputting them into space-time as numeric values? Well, this way of traveling through space is the exact opposite.[-]

[51ffff]We'll be slipping through a crack in this world into a Sea of Time, completely erasing our existence from reality.[-]

＠[51ffff]P.A. System[-]
[51ffff]...We have a lot on our plates right now. An adversary that attacked Chaldea. Those things that fell from space. The Crypters.[-]

＠[51ffff]P.A. System[-]
[51ffff]Like Mash said, we don't know WHAT'S going on right now.[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]P.A. System[-]
[51ffff]But one thing we know for sure is that they're all enemies[line 2]threats to humanity that even destroyed Chaldea.[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]P.A. System[-]
[51ffff]If we're going to do something about all this, we'll have to start breaking even more forbidden taboos.[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]P.A. System[-]
[51ffff]We are NOT handing over the future we worked so hard to take back to a bunch of newcomers we don't know the first thing about.[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]P.A. System[-]
[51ffff]So first, we find a way out of this mess.[-][sr][51ffff]Then, we strike back.[-]

[51ffff]Well, let's get going, Master [%1][51ffff].[-][sr][51ffff]We have a new weapon, and a new course ahead of us...[-]
