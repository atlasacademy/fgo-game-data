Now that Ganesha and Lakshmi's existences have been confirmed here...
[k]

＠Holmes
...we have proven beyond all doubt[sr]that Arjuna is not a perfect god.
[k]

＠Holmes
And because they have proven his flawed nature by enduring his massive world-undoing cataclysms...
[k]

＠Holmes
...the resulting drop in his divine[sr]power must be severe indeed.

What's more, Arjuna's basically cursed now.[sr]Since I sent them back to the past...

＠Aśvatthāman
Ugh, you guys piss me off. Can't you tell, dammit?[sr]There's several reasons.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
First, I had to push myself way too hard to use Shiva's power to send those two back in time.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
Second, I'm still technically Arjuna's Servant. If worse comes to worst, he could end up making me hurt you guys.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
And finally...there's no point keeping anyone around who can't fight worth a damn. 'Course, it pisses me the hell off.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Aśvatthāman
Don't worry. The moment those two were freed... The moment this world's destiny was thrown for a loop...I'd already done what I could.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
And by that, I mean my Spirit Core[sr]should still be good for something.

＠Aśvatthāman
You might think you've lost your way, and that you don't deserve to be thought of as human anymore.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Aśvatthāman
...But you're wrong. I think you put your foot right through the path you were headed down...
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
...to make extra damn sure you wouldn't get lost on it.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
Maybe I don't have any right to say this, seeing how I snuck in and massacred all those people in the dead of night, but my comrades were all a bunch of good-for-nothings too.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Aśvatthāman
Especially Duryodhana and the other hundred princes...[sr]Though they were still good guys at heart.

Anyway, I think they were fine just the way they were.

So, I get it.[sr]It's one of those things that just can't be helped.

It's not worth complaining about to anyone, and it's not worth asserting my rights over either.

That's why you feel bad for the world's lack of tolerance instead of for yourself. It's why you're appalled by human society's failure to help people like you.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Aśvatthāman
But you know, it takes a big person to think like that, too. I don't have a problem with it. Hell, I wouldn't have a job without it.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
Who knows? Maybe I'll end up running into you again someday as well.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
I'm sure you already know this, but as a Servant, I'm not good for much except being a fiery ball of endless fury.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Aśvatthāman
But...if you still haven't learned your lesson, and end up as my Master again someday...
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
...I'll make sure to make up for your lack of fire by getting good and angry on your behalf.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
Even if you aren't able to muster up any anger on your own about the world's injustices, I've got rage enough for both of us.

He may rule this land now, but he has not transcended its bonds. His current state is the answer he arrived at after countless hard decisions and tribulations.
