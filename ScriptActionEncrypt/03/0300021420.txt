＠
In the book of Genesis, it's written that[sr]the Creator rested on the seventh day.
[k]

＠
In this Lostbelt, fire is what comes on the seventh day.[sr]Not a day of rest, but the day of Ragnarök.
[k]

＠
After Wednesday...Odin's day...
[k]

＠
After Thursday...Thor's day...[sr]After Friday...Freyja's day...
[k]

＠
Then, after Saturday...Saturn's day...the day of the sun finally arrives.
[k]

＠
The false sun[line 2]the ball of fire glowing in the sky[line 2]is falling to the ground instead of remaining aloft.
[k]

＠
It shakes and cracks the ground, shattering mountains as it shifts and writhes to stand on its feet.
[k]

＠
In Proper Human History, this event manifested in the eruption of Mt. Katla, but not here. Our myth is this world's reality.
[k]

＠
Muspelheim[line 2]realm of fire, land of flame.
[k]

＠
The blazing inferno standing in for[sr]the true sun in this Lostbelt's sky.
[k]

＠
Now, the Muspel's leader[line 2]Muspelheim itself[line 2]descends upon us.
[k]

＠
One of the great kings. The one who will cast twilight's pall far and wide, arrives as a sun gone mad.
[k]

＠
...The only King of Giants in all the world.[sr]...Surtr, and his great flaming sword.

The Fiery King of Giants! The Border's instruments can't even properly measure his magical energy!
[k]

We can't even tell how far he is from us, either![sr]It's not clear whether he's way out there or...
[k]

＠Mash
It's no use! I can't even get a clear visual on him![sr]It could be some sort of heat mirage or something...
[k]

＠Mash
Either way, it is impossibly hot![sr]Make sure you stay behind me, Master!

Absolutely. I've had plenty of rest. It was nice to fall asleep without anything on my mind for once.

But I also can't deny that it was dreadfully dull. You will have to inform me about your recent escapades when we have the time.

I-is this really the time to just be idly catching up with each other!? The temperature outside the Border is skyrocketing even as we speak!
[k]

＠Goredolf
It's enough of a shock learning that giants and the like exist here, but now we find out they have a king!?
[k]

＠Goredolf
There's no telling how many reports I'll have to write now! Assuming anyone even believes them!
[k]

[charaFace E 9]

＠Goredolf
G-granted, it's not as though we're making any of this up...but once this Lostbelt disappears, any credibility those reports will have is going to disappear along with it...

Ah, hello, Mr. Goredolf. I see you are finally beginning to understand some of the problems Chaldea has been facing this entire time.

Perhaps now you may understand why, at first blush, our reports from the Singularities may have seemed so preposterous.
