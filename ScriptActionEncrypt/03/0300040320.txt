We did end up running into some wild animals,[sr]but you all handled them, no problem!

Fooou?

Indeed. Now that I've had a quick warm-up, I can say for sure that there is something strange about this land.

Yes. Compared to the one we know from...Proper Human History, was it? It feels as though there is something unusual covering the entire world.

Maybe, maybe not. It's nothing I can really put my finger on, nor can I put it into words.
[k]

＠Rama
All I know for sure is that, whatever it is,[sr]it's preventing us from performing at our best.
[k]

＠Rama
It doesn't mean we can't fight, but we definitely can't use one hundred percent of our power.
[k]

？1：Do you think it'll get better?
？！

＠Rama
Honestly, I don't know. Things might improve once we get used to it, but at this point, I just can't say.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Rama
Nonetheless, I wouldn't pay it too much heed.
[k]

＠Rama
Even if we can't use all of our power, we still have more than enough to carry out your commands.
[k]

＠Rama
So don't worry about us, Master. All you need to worry about is telling us what to do.

Now then, it looks like we have more hungry beasts to deal with. Let's take care of them quickly so we can continue investigating our surroundings!
