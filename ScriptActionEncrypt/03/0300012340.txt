＠Goredolf
H-hmm... I'm surprised to see that[sr]wicked Servant save her Master's life...
[k]

＠Goredolf
I'll still never forgive her for destroying my Chaldea, but I will at least commend her for that.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Goredolf
At any rate, well done, [%1]! I'm impressed you managed to capture Kadoc Zemlupus alive!
[k]

＠Goredolf
Now bring him back to the Shadow Border, and we'll[sr]have him cough up everything he knows abou[line 2]

＠Da Vinci
Hold on, we've got a new emergency! I'm detecting a massive wave of magical energy coming from the Tree of Emptiness!
[k]

[charaFace B 22]

＠Da Vinci
I've rarely seen so much magical energy in one place before! It's the Age of Gods True Ether! It's taking humanity and winding it back to the gods...!
[k]

[charaFace B 21]

＠Da Vinci
If we don't do something, this world is going to literally be turned on its head! No exaggeration!

Then the Tree of Emptiness HAS[sr]been activated, as I suspected!
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Holmes
But it's not too late, [%1]! From what I can tell, the Tree of Emptiness has only just taken root!
[k]

＠Holmes
You need to destroy it now,[sr]before it can finish the job!
[k]

？1：You want me to destroy THAT!?
？2：That's impossible!

I don't care if it's impossible, you fool![sr]You're going to have to do it anyway!
[k]

＠Goredolf
You almost died defeating Kadoc![sr]Why would you give up now!?
[k]

＠Goredolf
If you can't do it, we'll all be wiped out,[sr]and we won't even go down in history as losers!
[k]

＠Goredolf
The Musik family still has a name to make for itself! I'm not about to let it fade away in this abominable wasteland!

＠Da Vinci
This is the final battle! I'll send every last bit of extra magical energy the Shadow Border's got to your Servants!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That should let them fight in midair,[sr]if only for a short while!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
[%1], I know you've just been through a lot! I know you're tired and you have a lot to work through, but right now, you need to focus on the job at hand!

[charaFace B 5]

＠Da Vinci
That enormous, mysterious tree has been[sr]looming over us ever since we got here...
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Da Vinci
...but now it's time to find out[sr]what it really is for yourself!
[k]

？1：...Right. I'm on it!

Mash Kyrielight, moving out to provide backup and keep Master safe!

＠Mash
Kadoc let slip our enemy's name once before. The first Lostbelt's Tree of Emptiness! Its name is Orochi!
[k]

＠Mash
The central heat source appears to be located five thousand meters above! Initiating ascent now...!
