...I see they still have not[sr]yet learned their lesson.

＠Scáthach-Skadi
I do not regret deciding to love them, but I admit I did not expect them to be so tenacious.
[k]

[charaFace A 9]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
But I will accept that part of them as well,[sr]and love them just the same.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Ah, my human children. My Heroic Spirits of humanity. What a sorry sight you make. You seem to have confused stubbornness with persistence.

Are you sure about this, Your Majesty? They have been causing all sorts of trouble in your Lostbelt!
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Are you really not going to punish them, even after they destroyed dozens of your precious envoys?

Divine punishment is death, and it is[sr]not something to be doled out lightly.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Death eventually comes to all who live, so there is no need for me to help it along. I wish only to grant mercy and love.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
...Having said that.

Though the envoys did go into that battle of their own accord, the Chaldeans were...overly bold.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Perhaps I let them get away with too much. If they try to enter my castle while riding that wave of success...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
...I'm afraid that may lead to their[sr]deaths this time. How deplorable.
[k]


＠Scáthach-Skadi
The knight and the Crypter are both eager to fight them,[sr]it seems. Are they still out on the bridge?

Last I checked. Looks like they're both planning to meet our interlopers head-on.

＠Koyanskaya
If it were me, I'd be cutting off their escape first, especially since there's only one way in or out...but I suppose men who're convinced nobody can ever beat them don't believe in little tricks like that.

I will say, this does all bring back memories.

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Gram was once Odin's sword, as bright and powerful as the sun itself. Sigmund won it after overcoming Odin's test, and passed it on to his son.

＠Scáthach-Skadi
It is both ancient and newly reborn.[sr]With that at his command, Sigurd is powerful indeed.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Powerful enough to compel even me to keep an eye on him. I do not think there is any human in all of Scandinavia capable of defeating him.

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Former goddess. Demigod.[sr]One of Odin's daughters...
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Brynhild may have once been the greatest Valkyrie in all the Norse lands, but not even she can defeat Sigurd.
