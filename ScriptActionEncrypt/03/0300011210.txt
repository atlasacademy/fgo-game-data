＠Atalante Alter
This area stopped receiving food from the capital a long time ago. The capital also lays first claim to any Demonic Beasts the hunters catch here.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Atalante Alter
That is why these Yaga had no choice but to revolt.[sr]It was the only choice if they wished to survive.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
Securing a food supply was our most important order of business as well. It was simply not possible to grow enough grain to feed everyone.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
So we worked together with other villages to hunt[sr]Demonic Beasts and share their meat. [charaFace C 4]That was enough to get by...at least, until now...

＠Atalante Alter
Right. This may be difficult for a human like you to understand, [%1], but Yaga require a tremendous amount of food and can starve very quickly.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Atalante Alter
On average, a human can go as many as seven days without food as long as they have access to water...
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
...but a Yaga can only last without food for three days before they die of starvation.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
On top of that, the average Yaga requires several times the calories per day as the average human.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Atalante Alter
That is the plight every Yaga faces. If they are to survive in this frozen tundra, they must consume vast quantities of food.

This rat would need to eat constantly, or it would burn too many calories and die on the spot.

[charaFace C 7]

＠Atalante Alter
Is that really the best example[sr]you could come up with...?
[k]

＠Avicebron
At any rate, with so many Yaga, we could dedicate all of our resources to hunting, and still not have enough food to feed them all.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_76 1.5]

And we have precious little food left before we run out entirely... All right, how do we resolve this?

Even then, it is a catch-22. Should we devote all our food to THEM, our soldiers on the front lines will find themselves too weak to fight.

Please understand, I know that this is one of the worst moves the rebel army could make.

Then we should focus all our efforts on defeating the Oprichniki as swiftly as possible.

The worst possible scenario would be if the Oprichniki and the rebel army were to wage battle in the city with the residents caught in the cross fire.
[k]

＠Avicebron
The rebels would assume the city's residents side with the Oprichniki, and the Oprichniki would think nothing of slaughtering residents to get to the rebels.
[k]

＠Avicebron
That would leave no one willing or able to rescue the residents. Therefore, we must eliminate any factor that might lead to a massacre before it has a chance to cause the situation to escalate.
