Me, a hopeless unemployed shut-in[sr]who's only good at video games.
[k]

＠
A Divine Spirit Servant in name only who just happened to end up with godly power by some freakish twist of fate.
[k]

＠
There's no way Arjuna wouldn't hesitate to write someone like me off as worthless.
[k]

＠
I should've been the first to go. I'm just a spectator, an uninvited guest who's only here by coincidence.
[k]

＠
At least...that's what I thought.

But, you know...

...even I can't deny that someone knew what I was,[sr]and said they needed my help anyway.

I can't let the hero who placed his trust in me down.[sr]So...

＠
...And what could be more useless or unnecessary than a goddess of bad luck and misfortune?
[k]

＠
That said, I'm sure this one wish of mine can still be granted.
[k]

＠
No matter how despicable the role given to me may be, or how defectively unlucky I may have been born...
[k]

＠
...there shouldn't be anything wrong with praying for my family's happiness.
[k]

＠
No matter what anyone else says about you,[sr]I'll always be your friend, kind Alakshmi.
[k]

＠
Luck hasn't always been on my side either, like when I failed to defend my country...but that's exactly why I want you to trust me.
[k]

＠
This time, I won't let anything happen to the ones I care about.
[k]

＠
I'm going to make sure your wish to free Lakshmi from that awful false god comes true.
[k]

＠
That wish may not be anything so large as a country. It's easily small enough to fit into your hand.
[k]

＠
Which is why...I'll make sure to hold onto it tightly.
[k]

＠
I won't let it slip out of my hand for anything.

Not for the world, and not for its god!

Not to mention that I've[line 2]Ganesha's seen that Noble Phantasm a couple of times now.
[k]

＠Ganesha
Basically, all I've gotta do is sit still and keep camping until it's over, right?

I can do that sort of thing in my sleep. I know 'cause I have before. So I'm sure I'll be fine.

While I've thus far had to use my Noble Phantasm to defeat my enemies, it is meant to be used defensively.

This seems like a perfect opportunity to do just that.

Of course, I will do my best to tamp down my bad luck and prevent any unfortunate accidents...but if you cannot help but worry, I will understand.
