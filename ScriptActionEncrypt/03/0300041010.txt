That's right. I just noticed there was a big, weird cube in this Lostbelt, and didn't think anything more of it.

＠Peperoncino
I mean, sure, I considered investigating it and getting rid of it in case it turned out to be something dangerous, since it is so bizarre and all...

But I hadn't the slightest idea how to go about it,[sr]so I decided to just keep an eye on the thing.

They have weapons now, even if they were hastily assembled, and I've taught them how to fight as best I can.

I see. So if this world were a single entity, the sacred beasts are the white blood cells of its immune system.

＠Holmes
Since we can assume this world's god would be the head, the sacred beasts must be its macrophages, created to detect, isolate, and remove any foreign elements...

Their karma should determine what they become in their next life. At least, that's what my people believe.

＠Lakshmi
That's what a true Saṃsāra cycle is meant to be.

＠Lakshmi
We cremate dead bodies to free their souls, and ensure they go on to their next life without issue.
[k]

[charaFace I 5]

＠Lakshmi
But here...as long as the sacred beasts are around, nobody will be able to hold a proper cremation.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
If this world has no respect for the journey of the dead, and no hope for those who are left behind...
