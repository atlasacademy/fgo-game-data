That's right. Not that we have a lot to do, of course. Usually, the most we have to worry about is chasing off the odd stray dog or boar.

Hmm. If this were a foreign expedition, it would be no matter if they were somewhat free-spirited...

...but since this is a domestic matter, we would prefer not to use someone too...rambunctious.

Then, you are saying we should not evaluate our warrior on combat ability alone.

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[wt 0.1]

＠???
If they were to incite a rebellion, we could not keep an eye on them and Chaldea at the same time.
[k]

＠???
For example, do not even think about releasing anyone like the Taoyuan Brothers. They could get carried away and try to take over the empire for themselves.
[k]

＠???
We need a warrior who is not only brave, but also kind and modest. One who is fiercely loyal to this empire and its people, and who will defend them at all costs.
[k]

＠???
We would like you to choose this warrior, Captain.

Why else would we send you, our captain[sr]of the guard, all the way to Mt. Li?

＠???
Something could even go wrong with their mind during the unsealing, causing them to fly into a rage.
[k]

＠???
It would be bitterly ironic if we were to release a hero for the purposes of preventing a war only for them to transform into disaster incarnate.
[k]

＠???
So we deemed it prudent to have you present for the unsealing in the event such a danger did present itself. Do you understand?

＠???
Indeed. This hero must be strong enough to defeat these Heroic Spirits from another world...
[k]

＠???
...but not so strong that you would be unable to stop them in such an unfortunate situation.
[k]

＠???
With all of these requirements to consider,[sr]would you not prefer to choose this hero yourself?

These warriors deserve to be praised for all eternity for their help in establishing peace.

That said, we cannot bestow all of them with the same immortality we possess.
[k]

＠???
While there is little that can be done to cushion the shock they experience whenever they are awakened and see how much has changed...
[k]

＠???
...fighting on new battlefields has become a common enough occurrence for them that they are now accustomed to it.
[k]

＠???
What do you think? Do you not agree it is a much cleaner system than your Heroic Spirits?
