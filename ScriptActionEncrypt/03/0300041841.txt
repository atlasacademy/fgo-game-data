There isn't a single wasted motion in his combat style. Pepe...he's obviously very proficient in it.

＠Mash
I've seen other styles like it before.

You've been holding out on us, Peperoncino.

＠C：Peperoncino
Well of course I was! Beautiful people like myself don't reveal all on the first date!

[charaFace B 2]

＠Rama
Beauty!? I'm not sure what beauty has to do with this,[sr]but at any rate, I'm glad to see you can fight!
[k]

＠C：Peperoncino
But of course! True beauty is freedom, after all. There's nothing those of us with beautiful bodies can't do.
[k]

＠C：Peperoncino
If I told you you had a beautiful body too,[sr]Ramie, would you hold it against me?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Rama
I don't know what you mean by that, but whatever it is, I'm quite certain now is not the time for it!

Aww, you're no fun... But, I guess you're right.[sr]We do still have more sacred beasts to deal with!

Hang in there, people! Aśvatthāman and the others should be done soon! For now, the dance continues!
