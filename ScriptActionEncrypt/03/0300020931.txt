＠Koyanskaya
...So, they got away. [bgm BGM_EVENT_81 0.1]Well, I guess if nothing[sr]else, they passed that test of ability.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
They're certainly experts at running away. First they knock the giants aside, then they make a getaway on magecraft skis? I can't say I was expecting that.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Admittedly, they're still well within sniping range...

...but the smart money says to leave them alone for now. Especially since I've already got everything I came to this Lostbelt for.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Might as well let these humans fight it out among themselves, and I can just sit on the sidelines with a bag of popcorn.

[charaFace D 16]

＠Koyanskaya
Chaldeans, Crypters...[sr]Humans are humans, and being around them makes me sick.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I have no interest in either side...except for where it comes to you, Ophelia. Sort of.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
It's such fun, watching you come to grips with your wish for destruction. You don't even realize you're harming others.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
You think you're just a poor scapegoat,[sr]even as you blindly blunder about ruining everything.
[k]

[charaFace D 21]

＠Koyanskaya
Much as I don't care about them,[sr]I can't deny it's fun watching humans like that.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
This Lostbelt's beauty is all built on thin ice, and your naivete's going to show just how fragile it is.
