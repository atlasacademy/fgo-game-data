Presently, the Shadow Border is smack-dab in the middle of the blizzard. The odd bit is that it's a hundred degrees below zero out there.

It covers every inch of Russia,[sr]like a wall around the entire world.

And the aurora blocks all kinds of electromagnetic waves, so it's completely impossible to break through.

I can tell some of you want to write it off[sr]as just a storm, but you really shouldn't.

This storm can tear steel apart, level entire cities, even destroy the world as we know it. No wonder people thought of it as a god during the Age of Gods.

＠Da Vinci
Remember, storms are THE single most powerful source of naturally produced energy on the planet.

And one this massive is bound to be raging around with all the energy of a nuclear bomb. It stretches as far as the eye can see.

Holmes, you're one of our precious few fighters.[bgm BGM_EVENT_81 0.1]

＠Goredolf
As the only Servant capable of handling this situation,[sr]I forbid you from leaving this vehicle!
[k]

＠Goredolf
This armored car is the last bastion of humanity itself. There MUST be a combat-ready Servant here to defend it.
[k]

＠Goredolf
So you are to stay here and do exactly that, Holmes. Understand? That is a direct order from your commander.

Holmes is the only real fighter we have, and we can't afford to send him out into a dangerous area we still know nothing about.

[%1]. During our investigation,[sr]you adamantly refused to cooperate with us, correct?
[k]

＠Goredolf
Each and every time we asked you if a certain report was all made up, and insisted that you lot never actually saved the world...
[k]

＠Goredolf
...all you said was,[sr]“Chaldea fulfilled its mission admirably.”
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Goredolf
Heh. Not bad for a youngster like yourself.[sr]Indeed, I commend your attitude.
[k]

＠Goredolf
As such, I see no problem whatsoever with my plan. You're a proven warrior, as you demonstrated by repairing the past Singularities.
[k]

＠Goredolf
What sort of director would I be if I didn't trust a proven Master? A poor excuse for one, that's what. And so, I am placing my implicit trust in you.
[k]

So listen up. You are to go on this expedition alone.[sr]The rest of us will relay instructions to you from this operations room.

The Shadow Border's destruction would[sr]mean the end of humanity itself.
[k]

＠Holmes
It is indeed important that we investigate this area, but we must concentrate the bulk of our efforts on keeping the Shadow Border and the Paper Moon safe.
[k]

＠Holmes
Therefore, I will remain to guard the Shadow Border, and do whatever I can to aid the expedition from here.
[k]

[charaFace F 6]

＠Holmes
All that said, the fact remains that it would also be reckless [bgmStop BGM_EVENT_81 1.0]to send [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1] out on [&his:her] own.
