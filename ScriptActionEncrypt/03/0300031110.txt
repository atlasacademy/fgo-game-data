So after finding Nezha's remains[sr]in the Shang dynasty ruins...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...the emperor must have worked out some sort of cybernetics breakthrough way back in the B.C. era.
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Holmes
So the emperor must have abandoned the Zhenren's aspirations, and found a way to attain immortality another way.
[k]

？1：Zhenren?
？！

＠Holmes
The Zhenren were Taoist mountain sages[line 2]or hermits, if you like[line 2]who sought eternal truth.
[k]

＠Holmes
They also perfected their bodies,[sr]thereby achieving eternal youth and life.
[k]

＠Holmes
In Proper Human History, the First Emperor of Qin attempted to become one such Zhenren through an immortality elixir made with Chinese alchemy.

＠Da Vinci
But, as it happened, repeated, long-term use of this elixir only resulted in fatal mercury poisoning. Alchemy has always been a great deal more trial and error than success, no matter where it was practiced.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Da Vinci
But in this Lostbelt, the same emperor must have given up on alchemy in favor of technology based on Nezha.
[k]

＠Holmes
Well, Prince Nezha's body was still created by a Zhenren, so it's not as though that represented too big of a divergence from the path...
[k]

＠Holmes
...but the decision to surrender human form and grant only the mind immortality cannot have been made lightly.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
From there, if the emperor was able to stamp out all dissent in the rest of China and continue ruling the resulting empire at the height of its power...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...conquering the rest of the world[sr]seems only a matter of course.

It's definitely a risk. I mean, we didn't so much as tell the other Lostbelt factions that Zero Sailing is even a thing.

The Russian and Scandinavian Lostbelts both seemed[sr]to have their hands full with their own affairs...

[charaTalk C]

Quite so. This empire is under the impression that the rest of the world is part of its domain, and that the storm is responsible for severing their ties to the rest of their land.

They see this situation as an unprecedented disaster, much like we did with Proper Human History being wiped out of existence.

[charaFace B 24]

＠Da Vinci
There are several Lostbelts, but only one Earth. It's a recipe for the biggest, crappiest game of musical chairs ever...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...since there's no way for all these different civilizations to coexist.
[k]

[charaFace B 25]

＠Da Vinci
Instead of existing in parallel worlds, they all have to fight to exist on the same Earth.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So the Lostbelts that aren't preoccupied with just scraping by are eventually going to have to fight others if they want to expand their territory further.
[k]

？1：I think Kirschtaria even said something about that...

This could be our big chance to swoop in while the other sides are weak from fighting each other and take the prize for ourselves!
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Holmes
I'm afraid not, Mr. Goredolf. The outcome we need to be concerned about is Qin Shi Huang gaining an overwhelming advantage thanks to the Shadow Border's technology...

But the flip side of that is that's all the emperor can do. We should still assume our heat signatures are visible, even with a roof in the way...

Ordinarily, I would like nothing more than for those moved by beautiful things to live out their lives in peace and happiness.
[k]

＠Prince of Lan Ling
But now that we have met as[sr]enemies, that can never be.

[charaFace F 3]

＠Prince of Lan Ling
I had hoped to end you before you had to feel any need for fear. Forgive me for my incompetence.

Did you honestly believe I would fail to protect our allies in a moment perfect for assassination?

Perhaps a true assassin would have been[sr]able to elude me, but you? Not a chance.

Warriors like you are meant to cross swords on the field of battle, not skulk around in the dead of night.

＠Qin Liangyu
Your Master must be grossly ignorant of war to send you on a mission so badly suited to your abilities.

For that, you have my thanks, General!
