＠
I witnessed a foolish war.
[k]

＠
A foolish war that left me with[sr]nothing but one question.
[k]

＠
...Everyone understood how foolish it was.[sr]So why couldn't we stop it?
[k]

＠
That much was obvious. It was all down to everything that was bad and wrong in the world.
[k]

＠
In other words...the root cause[sr]of all this foolishness was evil.
[k]

＠
This is the sort of thing that happens when we can't rid ourselves of evil.
[k]

＠
Being defective is evil. Being unnecessary is evil. Dishonesty is evil. Lawlessness is evil. Intolerance is evil. Distrust is evil. Adultery is evil. Disloyalty is evil.
[k]

＠
Bravado is evil. Deception is evil. Obliviousness is evil. Ignorance is evil. Decadence is evil. Jealousy is evil. Stupidity is evil. Avarice is evil.
[k]

＠
Everyone knows these things are evil.
[k]

＠
So why can't we rid ourselves of them?
[k]

＠
So I made a wish. Perhaps I felt differently in other worlds, but here in this one...
[k]

＠
...I wished that there was a way we could be rid of them all.

＠
It was only after the war ended that I understood.
[k]

＠
The land stained red with my comrades' blood made it clear. The endless retribution, one cowardly act of violence begetting another, and on and on made it clear.
[k]

＠
The feeling of killing a hated rival[sr]with my own hands made it clear.
[k]

＠
The world simply cannot rid itself of evil on its own.

So if the world won't do it...someone else will have to.

And if no one else is willing...

...that leaves only me.
[k]

＠
After all...
[k]

＠
...the one who spilled the most blood on that land...
[k]

＠
The one most emblematic of the battlefield's evil foolishness...
[k]

＠
In other words, the most evil and foolish one of all was...

I wished for a just and proper world.
[k]

＠
An obvious, completely ordinary world that no one would ever think to question.
[k]

＠
A world so pure and perfect that only newborns and gods could believe in it.
[k]

＠
A righteous world where people[sr]never killed one another.
[k]

＠
Fortunately...the power I needed to destroy all evil and create that world...
[k]

＠
...was right there for the taking...
