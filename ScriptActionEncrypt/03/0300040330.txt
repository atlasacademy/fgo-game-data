Close your eyes.[sr]Clasp your hands.

...Offer your prayer to the god above.

Those three things are an important part of our daily lives. We all have to do them.

My father complains about everything, but he still prays every day, even if he always grumbles while he does it.
[k]

＠
If I forget to pray at the right time, he gets really angry. Well, he's always angry, but he gets even more angry.
[k]

＠
I think, if I had a mother...she'd get angry too.
[k]

＠
I've only heard about mothers in stories, so I don't know that for sure, but that's what I'd guess.
[k]

＠
Prayers are very important, so I can't blame them for getting angry.
[k]

＠
That's true for routine prayers...and prayers just for the sake of praying.
