These people have no weapons with which to defend themselves.

If their homes are destroyed, there is nothing they can do to avoid being eaten... This is horrific.

＠Karna
I've been focusing on the kali going after the more fragile houses, but there seems to be no end to them. It's becoming a problem.
[k]

＠Karna
I could wipe them all out at once with my Noble Phantasm...but that would also end up destroying the very people and homes we are trying to protect.
[k]

？1：Then that's definitely not an option!
？2：We'll just have to do the best we can taking them out one at a time!
？！

Agreed. This is truly a race against time.[sr]Every second counts when eliminating these monsters.

Good grief. When I decided to stay out of sight so as not to interfere with your information gathering, I never expected you would end up suddenly fighting such an intense battle.
[k]

＠Holmes
It would seem I'll need to run all the instruments at full power so as not to miss any data. So much for my break... Hm?
[k]

＠Holmes
Hold it. There is something else headed your way.
[k]

＠Holmes
Many somethings, I should say. And all distinctly different from the creatures you're currently fighting.
