...Just as life has winners and losers,[sr]so too does history itself.
[k]

＠
History's true winner was always Proper Human History,[sr]the world [%1] set in place.
[k]

＠
The losers are the Lostbelts,[sr]like the world the Yaga live in.
[k]

＠
This world was supposed to be pruned. Survival here[sr]is difficult, and happiness all but forgotten.
[k]

＠
But, it is still alive. Life here may be harsh and unbearable, but it strives to endure nonetheless.
[k]

＠
And there are six other worlds just like it.

I admire your willingness to keep fighting,[sr]even after your world was destroyed.

＠Atalante Alter
More importantly, I am a Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History myself. I should be siding with you.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
But...after I was summoned, I spent so much time among the Yaga that I cannot help but care for them.
