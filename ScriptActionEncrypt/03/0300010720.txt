We're tuning our equipment to make it capable of scanning for this world's life-forms, using that Yaga's life signs as a base...
[k]

＠Goredolf
...but the Shadow Border's scanner is an older model, so I'm told it will take time to enter the parameters and cross-reference it with the approximation data.

＠Goredolf
Suffice to say, it will go faster[sr]if you just look around, Avicebron.
