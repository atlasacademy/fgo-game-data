I thought you'd be ejecting me again,[sr]but this chamber and model both seem very different.

[51ffff]Well sure. Last time, we were sending you into the thick of an ongoing battle, but this time, we're just having you check out our surroundings.[-]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]Besides, Master's coming along with you,[-][sr][51ffff]and we can't go shooting you both out, can we?[-]

＠Mash
Ah.
[k]

＠Mash
Right... Good point.[sr]I forgot that Senpai will be joining me...

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]All right, let's try this again.[-][sr][51ffff]Are you all set?[-]

Yes.[sr]...Armored Shielder, ready to deploy.

...Senpai.
[k]

？1：How are you feeling, Mash?

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Don't worry, I'm feeling fine.[sr]And the Ortinax is in great shape, too.
[k]

＠Mash
Da Vinci really is a genius. Even after all that intense fighting we did in Russia, it's still in perfect working order.
[k]

＠Mash
Thanks to that, I should be able[sr]to use all of my power at any time.
[k]

？2：Aren't you cold?

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
No, not a bit.
[k]

＠Mash
I know we can see our breath out here, like this... (Blows) But that's the worst of it. Don't worry, I'm fine.
[k]

＠Mash
My cold-resistant gear helps a lot. Besides, it's not as bad here as it was in Russia. It does make sense that Scandinavia would still be freezing, though.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mash
All that aside, this place is very...snowy, isn't it, Senpai?
[k]

＠Mash
It's three degrees Celsius, but the wind isn't cold at all, and the air feels crisp and clean.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
It feels like a real winter[sr]wonderland compared to Russia!
[k]

＠Mash
I'm sure the temperature will drop to well below zero once night falls, but right now, I'm just enjoying how peaceful it is...
[k]

？1：Same. This place would get a lot of tourists if it existed in our history.
？2：It's really...romantic...

？！

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
I agree. I was just thinking the same thing.
[k]

＠Mash
We still don't know exactly what this Lostbelt is like, but at least this place seems quite peaceful.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
It's enough to make me hope that maybe...not every Lostbelt is dangerous.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
...But this really isn't the time to wax[sr]philosophical. Let's get started, Master.
[k]

？1：All right, it's perimeter check time!

[charaFace A 1]

＠Mash
Right! Let's start by looking for some sort of hill, so we can get a better view of our surroundings!
[k]

？2：Just make sure to stay close to the Border.

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
The Border is recharging for now while[sr]it stays camouflaged in the snow.
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
Da Vinci said it would take about three hours for it to charge up completely, so let's do our best to explore as much as we can in that time!

It seems you're about five hundred meters away.[sr]Well chosen.

That's just about the perfect distance, since we're still unable to detect hostile entities.

Thankfully, our emergency exit didn't strain the Border as much as we anticipated, but I'm afraid it's still not going anywhere for the time being.

Still, we cannot afford to waste any time, which is of course why we sent the pair of you out to investigate.

Thank you just the same.[bgm BGM_EVENT_79 1.0 1.0][sr]We have a faint visual here as well.
[k]

＠Holmes
The sun does indeed appear to be far larger than is normal... But it should be tens of billions of years before it reaches this size.
[k]

＠Holmes
We still don't understand how drastically a Lostbelt can change its environment, but if this one has transformed our sun into a red giant...
[k]

＠Holmes
Were that the case, forget the ice and snow.[sr]The whole world would be a scorched desert.

Ms. Kyrielight may be able to survive such an environment, but [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1] most assuredly would not.

I don't recall anything along those lines in Scandinavian or Germanic folklore, but I'll take another look just in case.

＠Holmes
I have a theory about that.

First, take a closer look.

Nothing is actually burning. I'm not sure how it works, but the fire appears to be something entirely separate and floating above the mountains.

＠Holmes
Mysterious, to be sure, but there is little cause to doubt this phenomenon is the result of some form of magecraft.

Whatever it is, it must be the work of a Crypter or a Lostbelt Servant. That, I can say for certain.
