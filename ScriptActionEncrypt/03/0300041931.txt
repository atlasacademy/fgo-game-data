[51ffff]Aśvatthāman's Spirit Origin was at its limit.[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]Even if his connection to Shiva did let him interfere[-][sr][51ffff]with time, he still had to sacrifice a lot to pull it[-][sr][51ffff]off.[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]So he chose to burn freely so he[-][sr][51ffff]could leave his Spirit Core behind...[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]...all so he could take advantage of the moment when[-][sr][51ffff]Arjuna's fallibility was proven beyond all doubt.[-]
[k]

＠[51ffff]Da Vinci[-]
[51ffff]Because he believed that by doing so, a certain someone[-][sr][51ffff]would come back, using his Spirit Core as an anchor...[-]

That's right. The possibility was always there.

＠Holmes
Would Arjuna ever absorb him,[sr]and make him a part of himself?
[k]

＠Holmes
Absolutely not.

＠Holmes
Even if he did possess Divinity, he is the one being Arjuna would almost certainly refuse to absorb.

After all...

Oh, my apologies. It would seem that the time is not yet right to speak of that.
