Pain that grows more terrible with each passing moment. Unfathomable bewilderment. Fear that threatens to swallow you whole.
[k]

＠
And above all, complete and utter loathing for the soldiers who look down at you in scorn.
[k]

In an instant, my pain turned to pleasure,[sr]and I vowed I would kill them all myself.

Yes... There was never a time I did not hear this voice.
[k]

＠
Not that Olga, Tatiana, Maria,[sr]Alexei, Papa, or Mama ever noticed.
[k]

＠
I could always hear this voice, whether[sr]I was playing a prank or climbing a tree.
[k]

＠
...But I also knew it wasn't[sr]anything like a guardian angel.
[k]

＠
If it was...I wouldn't be dead right now.
[k]

＠
Even when I only had seconds left to live,[sr]all he did was stare at me.
[k]

＠
He was a creature of fantasy, summoned by[sr]my desire to kill those who had wronged me.
[k]

＠
A monster with Mystic Eyes who only appears to Romanovs who were born with the ability to see him.

The soldiers hacked my body to pieces.[sr]Then they burned me, and buried my ashes.

Even as my clothes were stripped off, my body chopped to pieces, and my ashen remains planted in the ground...

And that is why I made certain those soldiers[sr]would never again enjoy a moment of peace.

＠Grand Duchess
...Did I wake you?
[k]

＠Kadoc
I wasn't sleeping.[sr]I was just dreaming.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
...Is there a difference?
[k]

[charaFace B 10]

＠Kadoc
Huge. It's the difference between your mind[sr]being shut off and your mind changing gears.
[k]

＠Kadoc
Dreams have long since abandoned my sleep,[sr]and now, I no longer need sleep.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
That sounds just like it is with Servants.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Kadoc
...So what's the occasion? Did something happen?
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
We received a report from the Oprichniki we sent out to the frontier. It didn't have much to say, but...
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
...it did mention that they had burned[sr]down one of the rebel army's storehouses.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Kadoc
That should make things more difficult for them.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
And then there's the Servants who aren't with the rebels. We should figure out what to do about them soon, before they think to challenge the Tsar's glory.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Kadoc
We should be able to handle them together.[sr]The metropolitan can take care of things here in the meantime.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Grand Duchess
...Then it's a date.[sr]I'll go get ready.
[k]

＠Kadoc
What do you need to get ready for?[sr]Just go like that.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Grand Duchess
You really don't know how to treat your Servants,[sr]do you? You're supposed to send me off with a smile.
[k]

＠Kadoc
Lay off.[sr]I'm all about efficiency.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Kadoc
There's no other way an ordinary guy[sr]like me could ever catch up to a genius.
[k]

＠Kadoc
The only way to beat someone who understands efficiency at a practical level is to dream up something even more efficient.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Grand Duchess
...I see. In that case, come help me get ready.[sr]That will be more efficient than simply waiting around.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Kadoc
...Yeah, yeah.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Grand Duchess
And stop answering me like some lazy soldier.[sr]It makes me feel like cursing you.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Kadoc
All right, Anastasia.[sr]So what is it you want my help with?
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Grand Duchess
I want you to help me choose which coat I should wear.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Koyanskaya
What an innocent, heartwarming sight.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
It was like watching them dance a waltz on top of the thinnest of ice, where one crack could send them tumbling into the abyss.
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Koyanskaya
Hehe. I guess it just goes to show that the Grand Duchess is a good match for our timid Kadoc.
[k]

＠Priest
A boy weakened by his reluctance to give up on anything, and a girl empowered after giving up everything, huh?
[k]

＠Priest
They are quite the pair.[sr]Each makes up for the other's shortcomings.
[k]

[charaFace D 10]

＠Priest
Even I can't think of a Servant and Master[sr]that are better suited to each other.[charaFace D 6]
[k]

＠Priest
Which is why you really should stop stirring them up just for your amusement, Koyanskaya. As the Tsar's aide, I can't overlook this any longer.
[k]

[charaFace C 14]

＠Koyanskaya
Oh my, I didn't know you were so patriotic. Does it pain you to see your beloved homeland so messed up?
[k]

[charaFace C 16]

＠Koyanskaya
Well, lucky for you, I was just thinking it's[sr]time I was on my merry little way anyway.
[k]

[charaFace C 8]

＠Koyanskaya
I've already said hello to the Chaldeans, and I've confirmed that the Tsar is coming along nicely.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
So since there's no work left for me to do here,[sr]I'll be moving on to my next assigned destination.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Especially since Lord Wodime has apparently gone[sr]and sent out Ms. High and Mighty Caenis too.
[k]

＠Priest
By all means.
[k]

[charaFace D 10]

＠Priest
Your preferred forms of entertainment are[sr]nowhere to be found in Russia anyway.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Priest
There are no humans desperately fighting for their survival here. Not a single person you would enjoy trampling all over.
[k]

＠Priest
No matter how you look at it, this Lostbelt[sr]is utterly devoid of hope for the future.
[k]

[charaFace C 20]

＠Koyanskaya
...Yes, so it would seem.[sr]That's the one part that's truly a shame.
[k]

[charaFace C 9]

＠Koyanskaya
Well, I'd best be on my way. No point sticking around a barren land with no money to be made, after all♡
[k]

＠D：Priest
I see you travel light.[charaFace D 7][sr]Oh yes, would you like me to pray for your safe travels?
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Koyanskaya
No, thank you. I have a feeling your prayers would only bring about the opposite of what they sought.
[k]

[charaFace C 17]

＠Koyanskaya
Well, here's to doing business again.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Remember, when you want to get rich at others' expense, or want to be happy no matter who else it might hurt...
[k]

[charaFace C 9]

＠Koyanskaya
...make sure to call on NFF Services![sr]We make all those sorts of dreams come true♡

You should learn to be mindful of the dangers that line your path, Koyanskaya. As things stand now, you may as well be a rat fleeing a sinking ship.
