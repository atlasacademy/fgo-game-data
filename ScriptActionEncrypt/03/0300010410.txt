...Well, Master, what would you have us do?

？1：Please don't kill them.

＠Avicebron
Hmm. If that is your command, then that is what[sr]I shall do. Is that your wish as well, Mash?

＠Avicebron
I see. Then I shall instruct my golems not to kill.
[k]

？2：Just hit them with the back of your sword, please.

＠Avicebron
That will be difficult,[sr]as my golems do not have swords, Master.

＠Avicebron
...I jest. I understand your meaning, of course,[sr]so I shall do my best to honor your request.
[k]

？！

＠Avicebron
Now, let me show you the most well-kept[sr]secret among the golems I command.

＠Avicebron
My fair Yaga, while I pledge to do my utmost to restrain myself, I am afraid that I cannot be held responsible should one of my golems strike you in a particularly vulnerable place.
[k]

＠Avicebron
Say your prayers.
