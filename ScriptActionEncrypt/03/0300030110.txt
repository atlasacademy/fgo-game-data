＠I：Sion
As you know, the Pseudo-Spiritron Calculation Engine Tri-Hermes is the heart of the Atlas Institute.
[k]

＠I：Sion
My father, the head of Atlas at the time, was supposed to create Tri-Hermes' sister unit, Trismegistus, before its development was handed off to me.
[k]

＠I：Sion
I proposed using Paper Moon-based Zero Sails as a method for sending people into the past[line 2]well, into Singularities anyway...
[k]

＠I：Sion
...but Chaldea's first director, Marisbury,[sr]had a different idea for a more reliable method.
[k]

＠I：Sion
His proposal was a process he called Rayshifting that involved transmitting physical bodies as Spiritrons.
[k]

＠I：Sion
It was a more proactive approach, given that it was closer to the Atlas Institute's prognostication.
[k]

＠I：Sion
Not exactly the most cautious proposal, all told, but the fact that a mage like him was willing to reveal his most secret arts like that spoke volumes.
[k]

＠I：Sion
I mean, if word had gotten out that the Animusphere family, one of the twelve Clock Tower Lords, was sharing technology with Atlas...
[k]

＠I：Sion
...it would have meant war with the other Lords, leading ultimately to the end of the Animuspheres.
[k]

＠I：Sion
Director Marisbury understood the seriousness of the risks, and chose to act anyway.
[k]

＠I：Sion
So the Atlas Institute decided to accept Chaldea's request, out of respect for the risks he took.
[k]

＠I：Sion
Of course, none of the other Lords ever did figure out what Marisbury was up to, so it ended up not really being a thing.

＠Sion
I suppose since you are being so meticulous and all,[sr]I can go ahead and tell you what you already know.
[k]

[charaFace G 14]

＠Sion
Answer the first: I escaped the reset[sr]because I was in the Wandering Sea.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Sion
The Wandering Sea is like its own little Singularity.[sr]It is always drifting between the world's textures.
[k]

＠Sion
That kept it safe even while the[sr]world was being wiped clean.
[k]

[charaFace G 14]

＠Sion
Answer the second: I came to the Wandering[sr]Sea because I predicted this future.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Sion
Tri-Hermes collects, organizes, and makes records of a ton of data about Earth, just like Chaldeas.
[k]

＠Sion
It is like a huge sea of information, all there for the taking. For alchemists like us, it might as well be our own primordial soup.
[k]

＠Sion
I was just taking a little dip in that sea[line 2]without my father knowing, of course[line 2]when I ended up arriving at that prediction.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Sion
In short, I was not sure how,[sr]but I knew the world would cease to exist in 2020.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]

＠Sion
It was the biggest dilemma of my life,[sr]to say the least.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Sion
I knew I had to do something,[sr]so I told my father about my prediction.
[k]

＠Sion
But that theater reject excuse for a fath[line 2][wt 1.0][charaFace G 4][sr]I mean, great head of Atlas told me was:
[k]

[charaFace G 14]

＠Sion
“I see humanity ending every day.[sr]Don't waste my time with trivialities like this.”
[k]

＠Sion
“Besides, you discovered this problem, my darling Sion. Don't you think you should be the one to solve it?”
[k]

[charaFace G 4]

＠Sion
And that was when it really hit me just how understaffed the Atlas Institute really was.

While I am at it, have a little bonus![sr]Answer the third: the moment I made my decision.
[k]

＠Sion
“I know. I will go to the Wandering Sea.”
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Sion
So I took the parts I was using to make Trismegistus II and used them to build a Hermes instead, then knocked on the Wandering Sea's front door.
[k]

＠Sion
By doing so, I secured a safe haven for both myself and future collaborators. Two birds, one stone.
[k]

＠Sion
I was certain that no matter how things unfolded, Chaldea was going to get knocked out of commission.[sr]It would be too important for our unknown invader.
[k]

＠Sion
There are pretty much two ways the world can end: gradually and suddenly.
[k]

＠Sion
Usually things would go gradually, progressing[sr]in stages until the lights go out, so to speak.
[k]

＠Sion
There are leaders all around the world doing their best to identify those scenarios and keep them at bay.
[k]

＠Sion
Meanwhile, the sudden types are more like traffic accidents, where everything happens all at once.[sr]Nothing much one can do, no matter how smart.
[k]

＠Sion
For that sort of thing, Rayshifting[sr]was all we had to fight back.
[k]

＠Sion
And what is happening right now, with the world bleached white thanks to invaders from outer space, is no exception.
[k]

[charaFace G 18]

＠Sion
Thus...
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Sion
...anyone meticulous enough to put together a plan like this would never overlook Chaldea, seeing as you were the only ones capable of Rayshifting.
[k]

＠Sion
I certainly would not. If I were trying to destroy Earth, Chaldea would be right at the top of my hit list. In fact, taking it out would be my opening move.

＠Sion
If these invader things saw you as that big of a threat,[sr]I was sure you could prove there was a reason for that.
[k]

＠Sion
I knew you would survive, and you would[sr]not give up, no matter how bad things got.
[k]

＠Sion
So, knowing that you would fight back,[sr]my task got a lot simpler.
[k]

＠Sion
I would make you a new base! I would create a second Chaldea for you and keep it ready and waiting.
[k]

＠Sion
That was really the only answer[sr]I could come up with at the time.
[k]

＠Sion
And now, even though you had no idea[sr]about any of this, you made it here.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Sion
And that is all I have![sr]Thanks for listening!

＠Da Vinci
Like, why are there no other mages[sr]from the Wandering Sea here?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They avoided the big reset just like you did, right?[sr]So why is it just you and Captain now?

＠Sion
Oh, they did not think this blank Earth thing was their problem, just as my father did not.
[k]

[charaFace G 11]

＠Sion
No, if anything, they were even worse. They honestly did not care if post-A.D. humanity lived or died.
[k]

[charaFace G 5]

＠Sion
Right when this whole bleaching thing started, and the Crypters were giving their victory speech, they said:
[k]

＠Sion
“You're the ones who should do something about this cataclysm. We no longer care what happens to human civilization.”
[k]

＠Sion
“We do understand the attackers' ideals,[sr]but regardless, we do not share them.”
[k]

＠Sion
Then they just up and left.
[k]

＠Sion
Oh, but before they did, they also said “You may invite the mages of Chaldea here if you wish. Feel free to use the Wandering Sea, but only in specified areas.”
[k]

＠Sion
"But take care not to enter our workshop.[sr]We can't promise you'll survive the experience."
[k]

＠Sion
Anyway, this place used to be the Wandering Sea's entrance, so it connects to a workshop devoted to bringing back several different Ages of Gods.
[k]

＠Sion
Not that that does us much good now, though,[sr]since it has that giant stone gate blocking it.

No matter. The Wandering Sea's magecraft is magecraft from the Age of Gods. There's no telling how powerful it is.

[charaFace E 25]

＠Da Vinci
...so it may be best if we leave that gate alone. The last thing we need right now is making more enemies.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The first order of business is to get the Shadow Border repaired. As long as we have a working ship, we can leave the Wandering Sea behind whenever we want.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I appreciate the offer, Sion, but I'll handle the Border's repairs myself. We don't want to impose on[line 2]
