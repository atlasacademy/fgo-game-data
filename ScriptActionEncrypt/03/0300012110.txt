＠Holmes
We'll soon be in the vicinity of the capital.
[k]

＠Holmes
This should be the closest we can get without the Oprichniki detecting us.
[k]

＠Holmes
Beowulf, Billy, once we park the Border, I would like you two to find bicorns for everyone to ride.
[k]

＠Holmes
It is imperative that you do so before daybreak.
[k]

＠Holmes
I'll have our Master take a quick nap in the meantime.
[k]

＠Holmes
Ms. Musashi, you and I will keep an eye on things here.

You've been to America, and other countries in the northern hemisphere, a number of places in the southern hemisphere, AND the tropics? Amazing!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Mash
Oh, but exactly where in the tropics?[sr]Guam? Indonesia?
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Musashi
Hehehe, nope! It was actually Hawaii! It was a real lucky break for me that they speak Japanese there!
[k]

[charaFace F 3]

＠Musashi
They even had an udon restaurant![sr]Maru...something or other!
[k]

[charaFace F 7]

＠Musashi
Anyway, Hawaii was the best! I didn't get along too well with their goddess Pele at first, but we were good friends by the end!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Mash
Wow, you're such a seasoned traveler, Musashi. It's like...you could Rayshift anywhere and fit right in.
[k]

[charaFace F 10]

＠Musashi
Y-you think? I mean, I'm always getting into some sort of trouble, like when I have to dine and dash...
[k]

[charaFace E 13]


＠Mash
But you seem to enjoy that kind of commotion, and always find a way to overcome it. I really admire that.
[k]

[charaFace E 12]


＠Mash
Me... I could never hope to do that.
[k]

＠Mash
I used to look forward to visiting all sorts of places outside of Chaldea...
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

＠Mash
...but now, the idea just fills me with dread.
[k]

＠Mash
I thought I understood that reading about things and actually experiencing them were completely different.
[k]

＠Mash
And yet... I used to be able to fight,[sr]but now, my shield feels unbelievably heavy.
[k]

＠Mash
...I'm finding myself scared of the people in this Lostbelt, and how they live their lives...

＠Musashi
Hmm, I see. So that's why you haven't been able to go out on the front lines.
[k]

＠Musashi
You know, [%1] used to brag about you all the time. I remember once, [&he:she] told me...
[k]

＠Musashi
“Mash's the best Shielder in the whole world! There's no other girl in the world I trust as much as her!”
[k]

[charaFace E 3]

＠Musashi
And that's made meeting you kind of strange.
[k]

＠Musashi
I thought, what happened to the strong girl [%1] always told me about? But now, it all makes sense.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

＠Mash
...I'm so sorry. I know I'm the only one relegated to providing rear support.
[k]

＠Mash
I hate knowing I could be out there fighting as a Servant, if only I could get out from under this fear holding me back...
[k]

[charaFace F 9]

＠Musashi
Hm? So it's fear that's keeping you from fighting,[sr]huh. In that case, isn't it out of your hands?
[k]

＠Musashi
I mean, who in their right mind WOULDN'T be scared to risk their life in battle?
[k]

＠Musashi
That's not really something you[sr]should feel bad about, you know.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_77 0.5]


＠Mash
Huh? You mean, you're scared too, Musashi?
[k]

＠Mash
Even after seeing so many worlds and surviving so many incredible, impossible things?
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_11 0.1]

＠Musashi
...Ouch. I didn't realize you thought of me as some kind of unfeeling gorilla woman...
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Musashi
I mean sure, I love fighting duels,[sr]but I've never not been scared to risk my life.
[k]

＠Musashi
Hell, when you get right down to it, the only reason I fight at all is because it's all I know how to do.
[k]

＠Musashi
If there was something else I was good at, or something else I WANTED to do, I'd give up the whole dueling thing in a heartbeat!
[k]

[charaFace F 3]

＠Musashi
I mean, the fact that I'm STILL drifting around aimlessly just goes to show I'm no more than a scoundrel who could never find another way to live, but never mind that.
[k]

[charaFace F 12]

＠Musashi
For you it's different. You used to be able to do this, and now you can't. Before, you were able to give it everything you had, but now, it feels like you just don't have anything left to give.
[k]

＠Musashi
And that right there says it all. You guys have never had to fight a battle where the whole world wasn't rooting for you.
[k]

＠Musashi
You've never been in a fight where your opponent loathed you, bystanders despised you...
[k]

＠Musashi
...even though what you were doing may have been the right thing, or if you were fighting to save countless lives from something terrible.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]

＠Mash
...
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Musashi
When you get down to it, these sorts of battles, they're all about making your problems someone else's.
[k]

＠Musashi
And that's ALWAYS gonna make your opponents unhappy.[sr]No matter how it shakes out.
[k]

＠Musashi
And now you're here in this world of polar extremes, and you've never experienced that. I'd be more surprised if you WEREN'T having a hard time of it.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

＠Mash
...Then what should I do? Do I just need to shut my emotions off, like some kind of machine?
[k]

＠Mash
Is that how you've overcome all the[sr]obstacles you've had to face, Musashi?
[k]

[charaFace F 12]

＠Musashi
Not really. I don't care what my opponent's problems are. I just tell myself that everyone's got their own stuff to deal with and that's that.
[k]

＠Musashi
So then if I end up cutting them down easily,[sr]that proves I was right and their battle's over.
[k]

＠Musashi
And if I can't do that, and they end up defeating me, it proves I was wrong, and that's that for MY battle.
[k]

[charaFace F 8]
＠Musashi
That's just the sort of good-for-nothing swordmaster I am. So I guess what I'm saying is that I am not really gonna be much help to you, Mash.
[k]

＠Mash
...I see. So I'm the only one who can solve my problems...
[k]

＠Mash
Still... I can't help but think...
[k]

＠Mash
Are we really doing the right thing for this world's history, and the Yaga who live in it?
[k]

[charaFace F 11]

＠Musashi
...Doing the right thing, hmm?
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Musashi
Well, whether you are or aren't,[sr]you're just gonna have to get past it!
[k]

＠Musashi
If it gets down to a life-or-death choice, you'll find the answer's pretty clear, pretty quick. That's when people start showing you who they really are.
[k]

＠Musashi
Still, your worries are important and just as valid as anyone else's, and you shouldn't be afraid to have them. That, I can say for sure.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]

＠Mash
R-really...? All this time, I thought[sr]I was just wasting opportunities...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Musashi
Thinking about things is never a waste. If you actually did shut off your mind, that'd weaken you more than anything else you could do.
[k]

[charaFace F 12]

＠Musashi
Sure there might be times when it seems like, physically, you've got nothing left, and you can't save anyone on your own...
[k]

＠Musashi
...but there's nothing more exhausting than the constant feeling that you should be doing something when you can't.
[k]

[charaFace F 3]

＠Musashi
I mean, sure, some people end up so overwhelmed by guilt or indecision that they end up becoming a burden, but that's not you.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Musashi
You're the kind of person who turns all that fretting into your own strength when all's said and done. So please don't feel like you're doing something wrong by worrying about this sort of stuff right now.
[k]

＠Musashi
Worrying is just what you need to be doing! Trust me, people like you are some of the scariest opponents you can face!
[k]

＠Mash
Musashi...
[k]

[charaFace F 7]

＠Musashi
Anyway, this isn't the sort of problem you can[sr]solve in a day, and in the meantime, you've got me!
[k]

＠Musashi
And when we face Ivan the Terrible, I plan on repaying for all the help I got in Shimousa and then some!
