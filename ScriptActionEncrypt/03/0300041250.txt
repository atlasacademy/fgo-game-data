I wasn't sure if it was because things were going well or poorly for you, but I found it strange that you didn't say anything about how things were going in your Lostbelt.

We may have an agreement not to interfere with each other's Lostbelts, but there are no rules against making personal contact.

That said, I was pretty preoccupied with my own affairs, so I was hoping to avoid answering any sudden business calls for a while...

...but you know, there aren't many people like Daybit around, right? So I thought it would be worthwhile to have him owe me a liiittle favor, without the Foreign God getting in the way.

Buuut, until Arjuna gets at least a little farther away from here, I can't really have as much fun as I'd like.
