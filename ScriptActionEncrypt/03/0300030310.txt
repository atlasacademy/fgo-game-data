＠Holmes
What's the Atlas Institute, you ask?[sr]An excellent question, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].
[k]

＠Holmes
It is an institute of alchemists built in the Atlas Mountains of Egypt.
[k]

＠Holmes
It's also known as the Titan's Pit.
[k]

＠Holmes
It's one of three branches of the Mage's Association, dealing with accumulation and measurement.
[k]

＠Holmes
Their alchemy is not at all like alchemy as you may know it, the kind that became mainstream in the Middle Ages. They are the progenitors of Magecraft, focused on investigating the principles of the world.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Holmes
While they are certainly mages, I understand that their Magical Circuits are rather paltry.
[k]

＠Holmes
Consequently, they do not rely on magical energy to learn the mysteries of the world, instead using a great number of tools.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Holmes
In a way, these tools evolved similarly to scientific progress.
[k]

＠Holmes
They treated Pseudo Spiritrons...souls as energy that could be observed and manipulated. This led to homunculi, life-forms that possess magical circuits.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Holmes
“We have no need to become the strongest.[sr]We simply have to create the strongest tool.”
[k]

＠Holmes
That was their motto.[sr]True to their words, they created many weapons.
[k]

＠Holmes
In the world of magecraft, they are called the Seven Taboos. The Atlas Institute created seven weapons capable of destroying the world.
[k]

＠Holmes
Realizing that they had reached their limits, they sealed them away.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Holmes
...There are still many theories about why they decided to build such weapons in the first place.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Holmes
The director of the Atlas Institute was given the title Atlasia.
[k]

＠Holmes
I saw a wall plate on the way here.[sr]It said Zepia Eltnam Atlasia.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Holmes
He was likely the last director. There seems to have been a successor designated, but the name wasn't recorded.
[k]

＠Holmes
The directors of this institute would always go mad, and as a result, they created forbidden weapons that would destroy the world.
[k]

＠Holmes
It's also possible that they would try to prevent the destruction of the world, fail in the process, and then go mad as a result...
[k]

＠Holmes
Regardless, this place is a storehouse of Mystic Codes unparalleled anywhere else on Earth.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Holmes
Although in reality, it's more like a disposal site.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Holmes
The alchemists of this institute would constantly invent things. These were treated as failed creations, and a mountain of terrible weapons accumulated.
[k]

＠Holmes
We're headed to the center of that. What do you think? Did you understand my summary of the Atlas Institute?

[k]

？！

[charaFace F 0]

＠Sion
So you have been inside two of the Lostbelts now, and experienced their differences from Proper Human History for yourselves.
[k]

＠Sion
These Lostbelts are dead-end timelines that were pruned away by human history itself once they were deemed unworthy of being allowed to continue.
[k]

＠Sion
For example, the Russian Lostbelt diverged from Proper Human History in the year A.D. 1570.
[k]

＠Sion
And it seems that each Lostbelt to appear on Earth has continued from its point of historical divergence on to the present day.
[k]

＠Sion
However, just because a Lostbelt may have diverged from further back in the past does not necessarily mean it is stronger.
[k]

＠Sion
A Lostbelt's strength[line 2]or threat, really[line 2]is not so much a matter of its age, but of how much it differs from Proper Human History.
[k]

＠Sion
The Yaga may have been physically different from mankind, but their lifestyle and culture were still carried over from Proper Human History.
[k]

＠Sion
By contrast, the people in Scandinavia may have led peaceful lives, but their society was essentially being kept on life support.
[k]

＠Sion
So given what we know from those two, I decided to come up with a metric we could use to rank and compare the Lostbelts.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Sion
I call it their Lostbelt Depth.
[k]

＠Sion
The greater the Lostbelt Depth, the more[sr]strongly it refutes Proper Human History.
[k]

？1：Lostbelt Depth...
？2：...So what was the Lostbelt Depth for the two we've seen so far?

？！

[charaFace F 17]

＠Sion
Wait, cut! Scratch that! I forgot about the Wandering Sea! We still have oceans too! Obviously!
[k]

＠Goredolf
Never mind that! Did you say the Atlantic!?
[k]

＠Goredolf
There can't possibly be a Lostbelt in the middle of the Atlantic! There's never been any inhabitants in the middle of the ocean in all of recorded history!
[k]

＠Sion
Well, there are now. In fact, that Atlantic[sr]Lostbelt is our ultimate objective.
[k]

＠Sion
That is the one spreading its Tree of Emptiness branches all throughout Earth's atmosphere...
[k]

＠Sion
...and I have good cause to believe it is where we will find the Crypters' leader, Kirschtaria Wodime.

For one thing, we have no means of getting there, as the Border is simply incapable of making such a long sea voyage.
[k]

＠Holmes
But there is another, more immediate difficulty.
[k]

＠Holmes
If there truly is a civilization in the Atlantic, it will be much, much older than any of the four great civilizations.

It will have existed since prehistoric days...a robust, stable world that will have had over twelve thousand years to develop.

＠Sion
I recommend that course of action as well.
[k]

＠Sion
Unlike Russia and Scandinavia, the storm walls bordering the Lostbelts in China and India are not expanding, so there should be no danger in leaving them be for a while.
[k]

＠Sion
As for the Lostbelts in Britain and South America...
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Sion
...Trismegistus calculates an extremely high probability that they will both self-destruct if left to their own devices.
[k]

＠Sion
I have not been able to get a proper reading on the British Lostbelt's depth, but that is just another sign that it is a poor fit for this world.
[k]

＠Sion
I have been unable to confirm what is going on in there, but compared to Proper Human History and the Foundation of Humanity, it is pretty clear that humanity in there is on the verge of collapse.
[k]

＠Sion
So it is reasonable to assume that mankind in the British Lostbelt will go extinct within the span of months rather than years.
[k]

(Sigh) So it turns out it[sr]was actually Gordy's fault...

At any rate, that's one problem taken care of.

＠Holmes
We've finished investigating the base, and removed all traces of Koyanskaya or anything she left behind.

We should no longer have to worry about unexpected visits from her in the future. Correct, Ms. Sion?

I would venture a guess that she is none too pleased right now, but you know what they say! What goes around, comes around!

Oh, for...I don't have time to feel sorry for myself! Holmes! Da Vinci!

＠Goredolf
As I was saying, we need to leave for the Chinese Lostbelt immediately! I trust the Border is ready!?
[k]

＠Goredolf
We only have ten days to find this plant,[sr]and we can't waste a single minute!

[charaFace B 9]

Come to think of it, are you sure we'll make[sr]it in time? I'm not already done for, am I!?

Don't worry. I have a thought about that.[sr]I just need to run it by Sion.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Sion, you designed the Paper Moon. Do you think it'd be possible to Zero Sail from here all the way to the Chinese Lostbelt's border?
[k]

Especially since I'm guessing[sr]Captain there is actually[line 2]

Of course I'll keep my mouth shut![sr]As long as you help us out, that's all that matters.

＠Da Vinci
In my estimation, a Zero Sail should let us jump from the Wandering Sea straight to China.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We'd still have to worry about getting inside from there, of course, but I figure the actual trip to the Lostbelt would take less than a day.

What do you think, Sion?[sr]Am I totally off base?

Nope, all sounds right to me, Da Vinci. No wonder you are Chaldea's...or rather, humanity's guardian.

＠Sion
I would have suggested the same thing,[sr]you were just quicker about it.

The Atlas Institute will be glad to get you to the Chinese Lostbelt. Right, Captain?

I'll have you to the Chinese Lostbelt in less than half a day. After that, it's all up to you guys,[sr][%1].

Guess we all agree, then!

＠Sion
Okay everyone, get ready to head out. I estimate you should have room in the Border to fit supplies for about fifteen days!
[k]

＠Sion
I will open up the Wandering Sea's dock in an hour,[sr]so please make sure you are all set by then.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Sion
Your next destination is the Chinese Lostbelt.
[k]

＠Sion
Your objective is to obtain some Xiān Shuāi Míng Mài, investigate the Lostbelt, and completely cure your two poisoned personnel.
[k]

＠Sion
Oh, and for the bonus round, you can defeat the Lostbelt's king, cut down the Tree of Emptiness, and take out the Crypter!
[k]

＠Sion
I know you are working against the clock as well as any hostiles you encounter, but try to stay calm.

[charaFace F 5]

＠Sion
At this point, any differences the Atlas Institute or the Wandering Sea may have had no longer matter.

＠Sion
From this point on, I hereby dub the Wandering Sea Chaldea No. 2...Novum Chaldea.

＠Sion
As Trismegistus II's caretaker,[sr]I will do everything I can to support you.

＠Sion
All right then...
[k]

＠Sion
It is time to get this operation[line 2]this Order to explore and decipher Lostbelt No. 3 underway.

＠Sion
Good luck with everything,[sr]and I will see you all when you get back!
