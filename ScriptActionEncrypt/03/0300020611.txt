Peperoncino is an excellent Crypter in his own right,[sr]and his Lostbelt is of high quality...

Tell me, my beloved daughter. As leader of my hundred-odd envoys, what do you make of the incident in Village 23?

...Very well.

[charaFace D 6]

＠Thrúd
Of course, if you say these transgressors will be permitted to remain alive, we shall act accordingly. I do think they can be left alone...
[k]

＠Thrúd
As for the destroyed envoys, they were mass-produced units with no ability to adapt to changing circumstances.
[k]

＠Thrúd
Still, based on what I've seen in our shared records,[sr]I don't think the three of us will need to respond.
[k]

＠Thrúd
Even if circumstances change, and we do end up needing to deal with them, I think the giants...

...or a mass-produced unit's self-destruct function should be sufficient.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Oh?
[k]

＠Thrúd
I am told the transgressors are a human and one who is half-human, half-Heroic Spirit. There is no need for the three of us to confront such a lowly foe.
