...I've heard there's different kinds of alcohol, but I've only ever had the one kind. What do the others taste like?

＠Billy
Ah, right. Most of what y'all got to drink's just straight vodka with no kinda flavor to it, yeah?

I've still got a bit of the last batch I distilled.[sr]Care for a nip?

Sure, I'll give it a shot.
