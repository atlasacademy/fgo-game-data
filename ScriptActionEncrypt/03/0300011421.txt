Stones, trees, metal...[sr]You can just use all kindsa stuff, can't you?

You are correct, for the most part.

Well, there's no shortage of snow 'round here.[sr]Could you make a golem outta that?

＠Avicebron
Leaving aside what to use as a core, I imagine it would be rather difficult to accumulate and maintain the material.
[k]

＠Avicebron
Although, they would have an advantage in that they would be difficult to physically destroy, as they could always just reassemble themselves from all the snow around them.
[k]

＠Avicebron
...But no, it just wouldn't work. No matter how I run the numbers, the average core just would not be capable of accumulating sufficient quantities of snow.
[k]

＠Avicebron
Using more valuable materials for the core would only result in golems that, while nigh impossible to destroy, are otherwise exceptionally weak.
[k]

＠Avicebron
What do you think, Master?
[k]

？1：All this magecraft stuff's a little over my head...

＠Avicebron
Ah yes, I forgot that magecraft isn't your strong suit.
[k]

？2：What if you froze them?

＠Avicebron
True, this temperature is low enough to freeze almost anything instantly. The resulting golems would still have limited capabilities, but that would be a better trade-off, yes.

That said, the Paper Moon did show us what Earth[sr]currently looks like when we emerged here.

It's become a smooth, perfectly round planet. Not a single sign of nature exists to be found, to say nothing of civilization.

There may be some slight variations in elevation, but there are no mountains surpassing a thousand meters that we have seen.
