[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Chaldea Engineer
Apparently they'll be coming up here by helicopter once this blizzard dies down.
[k]

＠Chaldea Engineer
Soon we'll have a new director appointed by the Mage's Association, along with fifty of their flunkies.
[k]

[charaFace C 3]

＠Chaldea Engineer
Saying it's an investigation sanctioned by the UN sounds nice, but let's not kid ourselves about what this is. It's just a hostile takeover.
[k]

＠Chaldea Engineer
All this time, the higher-ups at the Association have written off Chaldea as just another observatory...
[k]

＠Chaldea Engineer
...but the moment they see its value,[sr]they swoop in to milk it for all it's worth.
[k]

...Maybe it's weird for me to be upset about this, but I feel sorry for Olga Marie. She'd never have wanted things to turn out this way.

[charaFace C 3]

＠Chaldea Engineer
...But still, when I think back on it, I can't help but be impressed at how well she did despite all that...
[k]

＠Chaldea Engineer
Honestly, we should've been more considerate of her circumstances.
[k]

＠Chaldea Engineer
Even if she WAS the daughter of a Lord family, she was still just a girl fresh out of school who'd recently lost her father.
[k]

＠Command Room Staff
I guess. But you just have to set that sort of thing aside when you take a position of power, right?
[k]

＠Command Room Staff
As the heir to the Animuspheres, she should've had that stuff completely covered, no matter what her age or how recent her dad's death was.
[k]

[charaFace D 3]
＠Command Room Staff
To be brutally honest, she should never have taken over as director in the first place, but she clung to the authority it gave her anyway. And look where that got us.
[k]

＠Command Room Staff
Chaldea was nearly obliterated, and we had to beg the Mage's Association for help to rebuild it.
[k]

＠Command Room Staff
So it sucks, but if we want Chaldea to keep going, we have to let this new director take over.
[k]

＠Command Room Staff
And if Olga Marie WAS still here, you can bet she'd be the first in line to hand off the responsibility.
[k]

＠Command Room Staff
Seeing as the alternative is having it shut down for good.

I used to study cosmic rays as a run-of-the-mill physicist before I came here.
[k]

＠Chaldea Engineer
It was the last director, Marisbury, who offered me a job here. At the time, I was struggling just to get by.
[k]

＠Chaldea Engineer
I'm guessing he wanted me for my experience with particle accelerators. At first I thought he was full of shit...
[k]

＠Chaldea Engineer
...but eventually, his earnestness and passion won me over. Before I knew it, I found myself out here in the middle of nowhere.

＠Da Vinci
In the year 2017, Chaldea detected an abnormality in Chaldeas, a simulation of the world as it'll be one hundred years in the future.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The light of civilization had gone missing from Chaldeas, which meant that it had observed the end of humanity.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We hypothesized that the source of this abnormality lay in 2004, in the Japanese town of Fuyuki. We decided to send Team A, of which Mash was a member, there on an experimental Rayshift.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Unfortunately, the entire team was incapacitated in an act of sabotage, as were the other Masters on standby. That's Chaldea down forty-seven Masters in a single stroke.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But then there was you: [%1], the forty-eighth Master. You were just a commoner selected to fill a quota, but you Rayshifted successfully.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And so, as humanity's last Master, the mission of preventing mankind's extermination fell to you.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That began the Grand Order,[sr]our mission to restore humanity.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Chaldea went on to fix seven Singularities before finding the Final Singularity.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
There, they defeated the King of Mages, the one behind the Incineration of Humanity, and succeeded at repairing the foundations of human history.

But, your incredible, legendary adventure has come to an end, and it's time to return to reality.
[k]

Frankly, it's time to pass the torch.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We've lost eighty percent of our staff, and we simply can't continue operating as matters stand.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So, we're getting an influx of new staff from the outside.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The formalities were finished about a month ago, and they just finished choosing the new staff last week.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Which means they've now been discussing[sr]what to do about us for almost a year.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
This staff is practically knocking on our doorstep as we speak. In a few days, Chaldea will officially be under new management.
[k]

？1：A new Chaldea...

？！

[charaFace E 2]

＠Da Vinci
That's right. We'll have a new director chosen by the Mage's Association itself, along with a staff he personally trained.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The new director is Goredolf Musik. He's the heir to a fairly well-known family in the magecraft world.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I'm told he spent pretty much everything[sr]he had to snag Chaldea and all its benefits.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He probably did that as a show of power, to let everyone know that Chaldea is now exclusively under Musik family control.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The proceedings are already underway, and it looks[sr]like most of our current staff are being let go.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Da Vinci
But that's not the problem. You'll still be you,[sr]even if they kick you out of Chaldea for good.

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_2 0.7]

The problem...is the UN inspectors[sr]who will be coming along with them.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_5 0.1]

＠Da Vinci
Grand Order or not, there's no denying Chaldea broke a whole mess of regulations.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Changing personnel without clearing it with the Mage's Association... Disclosing highly classified information to low-level personnel...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Overusing Servant summons, which were supposed to be limited to up to seven Servants... Conducting Rayshifts without UN authorization...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
As far as they're concerned,[sr]these are all major crimes.
[k]

？1：Even though we didn't do anything wrong?
？2：Even though we were fighting to protect humanity?

？！

[charaFace E 2]

＠Da Vinci
Exactly! Not a single one of us did anything for our own personal benefit!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...Couldn't even if we wanted to, in fact, seeing as we were the only humans left in the entire world!
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Da Vinci
...But unfortunately,[sr]that meant less than nothing to them.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Sure, they could see what we were fighting against in the data.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The yearlong, global blank.[sr]The traces the Singularities left behind on Sheba.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Unbelievable as the Incineration of Humanity might be, the Association had to admit that it really did happen.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But for them, the data is just that, data.[sr]All they had to say in response was, “So what?”
[k]

＠Da Vinci
As far as they're concerned, the world ended while they were sleeping, and by the time they woke up, it was all back to normal.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The only thing they can see is the scores of dead,[sr]the valuable Master candidates who were injured...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...and the litany of rules Chaldea[sr]broke while this was going on.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So this investigation is taking place to determine if these acts were deliberate.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In the eyes of the Association, the staff of Chaldea is nothing more than a band of criminals.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_5 1.0]

＠Da Vinci
Of course, that's why I'm writing all these reports, to prove that this is all just a big misunderstanding.

Since data is all they've got to work with,[sr]data is how we're going to cover our asses.

So as far as the people outside are concerned, this is of critical importance, since it has to do with their own safety.
[k]

？！

[charaFace E 0]

＠Da Vinci
Oh, and there's one more serious issue you should be aware of, especially since it concerns you directly.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The blast in the Command Room left all forty-seven of those Masters with horrific injuries.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
With them all near death, we cryogenically froze them in their Coffins. We've been slowly thawing them all out, one by one, over the past year.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Now only the seven Team A Masters whose Coffins were still activating when the blast went off[line 2]again, the entire team, save for Mash[line 2]remain in cryostorage.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's a good bit harder to thaw and revive them, you see, so we kept putting it off until they were in perfect condition.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But once this investigation gets underway, we should finally be able to revive them thanks to new staff who specialize in healing spells.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And I'm guessing that once that happens, some of these Team A Masters are going to take over as the new Masters of Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]

＠Da Vinci
The new director has been saying he won't need you anymore, and that you will be relieved of your position within the year...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...because he's already got his eye on other Masters he trusts from distinguished mage families.

I believe you mean “we,” Leonardo da Vinci.

After all, I AM the one who did most of the work investigating the Association's movements, anonymizing the Spirit Origin graph, and dismissing the Servants.

Not that it was especially onerous for me, of course.

[k]

[charaFace E 2]

＠Da Vinci
Sorry about that, [%1]. The fact that Holmes is here is the toppest of top secrets.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I have not so much as included his name in any of my reports to the Association.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
As far as they know, Sherlock Holmes was never among the Heroic Spirits summoned to Chaldea, and I mean to keep it that way.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I guess you could call this a kind of insurance policy, just in case everything goes south?
[k]

？1：Insurance policy...?
？2：South...?

Indeed. In the event that we face an enemy we cannot see...
[k]

＠Holmes
...we will need an ally the enemy cannot see in turn. Hence our extreme caution.
[k]

＠Holmes
Of course, I am no fighter. Should things turn violent,[sr]I won't hesitate to retreat to the workshop.
[k]

？1：You're not a fighter...?
？2：What about your baritsu...?

？！

[charaFace F 3]

＠Holmes
Baritsu is strictly for self-defense. If armed assailants were to attack, I would only be able to protect myself.

＠Da Vinci
The main reason I had Holmes stay behind was to help with something I've been working on.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You see, Holmes is an even more skilled scientist and mage than his stories let on.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So I figured he would be the perfect choice to help me with a little something I've been building.

Look at this. Just an ordinary briefcase, right? But its contents are more valuable than all the treasures in this world combined.

＠Da Vinci
We still haven't finished moving everything around, so I can't take it out just yet, but we should be done in another five days.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If my calculations are correct, and they always are, it'll be done before we have to leave Chaldea. I'll tell you what it is then.
