The Ortinax's output has dropped, but the auto-maintenance function should restore it in ten seconds.

The Ortinax's auto-maintenance[sr]function should finish in time, but...
[k]

＠Mash
...the situation could change significantly, depending on how long the envoys keep attacking... Khh...
[k]

？1：And we won't be getting any help from the Border.

Once they take the flowers, the grown-ups are supposed to go through the gate. That's how it's supposed to be! That's how it's always been!

＠Gerda
Once they do, the giants show[sr]up and squish them in no time.

I've seen it from the crack in the gate lots of times. Smoosh. They don't say anything, they can't do anything...
