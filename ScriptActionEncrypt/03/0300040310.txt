I have to ask: are you sure this will work?[sr]You had a fairly rough go of it in China, didn't you?

Granted, I was so out of sorts early on there thanks to having to confront my mortality that I wasn't able to make the same sort of coolheaded decisions I usually do...

I actually don't quite remember what happened very well! Still, I do recall hearing something about being unable to summon Servants there?

I see. Now I understand. So we are fighting for Chaldea on behalf of Proper Human History.
[k]

＠Rama
Indeed! It sounds as though your path thus far has been quite arduous, Master [%1].
[k]

＠Rama
But now that you have summoned me[line 2]the King of Kosala, and avatar of Vishnu[line 2]your worries are over.
[k]

＠Rama
No matter what manner of hardships may lie ahead, my sword[line 2]a bane to all evil[line 2]will rend any obstacles you encounter asunder!
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Rama
And on the slight chance I'm not enough by myself, you even managed to summon Karna, the Hero of Benefaction!
[k]

＠Rama
This goes far beyond just good luck... Just how many good deeds have you done to earn this kind of karma, Master?
[k]

＠Karna
You give me far more credit than I deserve...
[k]

＠Karna
Still, I can promise you this, Master. Now that I have been summoned here, I will do everything in my power to see your will done. I await your orders.
[k]


＠Karna
That said...as a kshatriya, I could ask for no greater honor than to fight alongside the King of Kosala.
[k]

＠Karna
Truthfully, even I cannot deny that I feel fortune smiling upon us.

I'll say! Even without the home advantage going for them, I'd say these were some of the best possible Servants we could have hoped to summon!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Rama, Karna, Arjuna, and Pārvatī were my top choices from the Spirit Origin graph going in...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...but it was still a roll of the dice as to whether any of them would respond to the summon!
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Da Vinci
And if that weren't good enough, Rama and Karna are both enormously well-known and influential here.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Given all that, along with the fact that they know India like the backs of their hands, I'm sure they'll be even more helpful than usual!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Da Vinci
That said, I'm sure some things might be off for them here, given that it's a Lostbelt and all, but I'm sure they'll still handle it way better than us Europeans☆

Yes, it's very dry.[sr]It makes me feel...lonely.
