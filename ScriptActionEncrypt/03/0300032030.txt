＠Holmes
You went out of your way to fight us as human, even knowing that we had no chance in battle against your mechanical vessel.

[charaFace C 4]

＠Holmes
You have borne a vast responsibility all these years, and for that you have my respect. But, the results speak for themselves.

＠Holmes
Even as a Zhenren, you chose to prioritize defense.[sr]But defense is a role for gods, not humans.

Humans' nature lies in pressing ever onward, no matter how foolish it may be to do so or how disgraceful the results may be.
