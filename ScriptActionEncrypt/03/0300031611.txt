A notable figure from the Chu-Han Contention,[sr]which took place after the death of Qin Shi Huang.

But then, why would she bother infiltrating Chaldea and applying to be a Rayshift candidate?

Marisbury may have been a just person, but it seems like he also managed to do good[line 2]that is, his best, as a mage.
[k]

[charaFace E 16]

＠Koyanskaya
I expect he must have been anxious.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I imagine he had to wonder if Rayshifting was even possible, and if it was, whether humans could actually survive the process.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I'd guess that's what prompted him to bring[sr]Yu Mei-ren on as a backup plan of sorts.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
No doubt he must have thought that even if it turned out humans couldn't withstand a Rayshift...
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
...she would either survive or could be resuscitated, thanks to her sturdy True Ancestor body.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
That must be why he covered up her true[sr]identity under the name Akuta Hinako...
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
...and sent her a formal invitation to Chaldea after she'd been hiding away in the margins of history for centuries.

I do recall Akuta Hinako was already part of Chaldea's staff even before Team A was formed.

Marisbury must have wanted to prove the viability of Rayshifting come hell or high water.

＠Koyanskaya
...even if there turned out to be no mere humans who fit the bill whatsoever.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
But as luck would have it, not only did there turn out to be plenty of viable candidates...
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
...the Demi-Servant plan he had come up with to improve the odds of summoning a Heroic Spirit after the Rayshift worked out as well.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
All of which meant that Marisbury no longer needed to bother giving “Akuta Hinako” more special treatment.

Yet even so...I can still feel the grip of his despair over my fate...coiling around my heart.

“Ah, Yu, my Yu... What will your fate be?”
[k]

＠
That's right. I seek an end to eternity[line 2]a place where I can hold my head high and declare that I have gone as far as I can.
[k]

＠
My sole wish... My one, final request...
[k]

＠
...is that I may tell my dearly departed[sr]that he no longer need weep for me...

＠Qin Shi Huang
It has been five months since your arrival. We have now scanned your entire body forty-eight times in total. Our analysis is complete.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
Every last one of your body's secrets has been recorded within our memory circuits.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
We have at last learned the secrets[sr]of the Zhenren's immortality.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
You did well, fairy. Or perhaps we should continue to call you Akuta Hinako?

You may have anything you like as a reward.[sr]Or is he alone still enough, as you initially requested?
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
He is. I desire nothing else.

Then, per the terms of our agreement, we hereby bequeath custody of Kuaiji Zero to you.

You have served us faithfully for centuries, our very first mechanical retainer. Congratulations on your retirement.

We do not know what sort of name our mechanical retainer may have made for himself in your history...

＠Qin Shi Huang
True, we did learn the Mystics of life[sr]through our obtainment of the Fusang Tree.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
But we never came across a single sage or fairy in all the time we spent exploring their lands.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
You are the first genuine fairy we[sr]have ever laid eyes on, Akuta Hinako.

At any rate, this fulfills the final part of our contract.[sr]Tell us, what will you do now?
[k]

[charaFace H 4]

＠Yu Mei-ren
If possible, I would like to stay in a remote part[sr]of your land, and live out my days in peace.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
How modest of you.[sr]But...will Chaldea let you do that?
[k]

[charaFace H 0]

＠Yu Mei-ren
...
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
The Chaldeans have already incurred your wrath.[sr]There is no need to dirty my hands further.
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
It is only a matter of time now before one of your valiant Mt. Li warriors presents you with their heads.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
Ah yes, we see. You do not want “Xiang Yu” to see you...getting rough, so to speak.

＠Qin Shi Huang
Very well. We prefer this mild-mannered act to the true colors you displayed at Ankang anyway.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
However, there is one thing we must ask you before you leave our service.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
...Is this world going to perish?

At this point, I can no longer[sr]tell which will emerge triumphant:

＠Yu Mei-ren
The will of this world to survive, or the will that would see this world destroyed.
[k]

[charaFace H 0]

＠Yu Mei-ren
All I can truthfully say...is that I couldn't possibly care less.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
A good answer. We know now that if nothing else,[sr]you will never oppose us.
[k]

＠Yu Mei-ren
...Now then, if you'll excuse me.

...Are you sure about this, Your Imperial Majesty? I believe she still knows more about the monsters that have invaded us than she is letting on.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
Yes, we are sure she does.
[k]

＠Captain of the Guard
I was shaken when she said she did not care if this world lived or died, despite saying she would stay...

[charaFadeout A 0.1]
[wt 0.1]

＠Qin Shi Huang
She is a Zhenren, a true human...the only one in this world who is on par with our royal personage.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
Had she voiced her intent to do something along the lines of protecting the world, then our wrath would have been swift and merciless.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
That would indicate her desire to fight us for this world, after all this time we spent protecting it.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
But that is not what she said. Indeed, she showed she has no attachment to this world whatsoever.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
In consequence, she can coexist with us as we rule.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
For there can only be one human who[sr]controls the world in its entirety.

Having two or more humans exist inevitably leads to quarreling. So this cannot be permitted. As this world's only human, we shall guide the common people with our love.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
All they need concern themselves with is tending their land, filling their bellies, sleeping, and reproducing.[sr]What could be more peaceful?
