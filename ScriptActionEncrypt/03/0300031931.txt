This building won't last much longer. If you can still stand, you should leave now, before it collapses.

Heh... As it happens, that battle really[sr]took every last bit of energy out of me.

＠Han Xin
...So I was hoping I might just[sr]be able to sit here a bit longer.

Heh, I suppose we'll just have to wait then...

You misjudged how much stamina you had halfway through the fight, didn't you? Did you think you could keep up the same pace as when you were young or something?
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Captain of the Guard
To my shame, yes. I hate to admit that I began feeling my age at a mere one hundred and fifty years old, despite the emperor giving me personal instruction in the sage arts.
[k]

[charaFace E 22]

＠Han Xin
You should've come to Mt. Li when you had the chance, instead of insisting on staying on active duty.

[charaFace E 23]

＠Han Xin
...Man, I wish I could've seen you fight in your prime.[sr]I bet it was something to behold.

It will mean the empire's most valuable Mystic[line 2]the cornerstone of our peaceful civilization[line 2]will fall into enemy hands...
