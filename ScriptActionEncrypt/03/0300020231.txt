We've defeated another giant and several ice beasts.

Wait. You're right, Mr. Holmes. I can sense faint magical energy around us... Coming from the snow...
[k]

？1：Maybe it's a Lostbelt Servant that can control snow?

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
I'm not sure, but that certainly seems possible.
[k]

？2：Could a giant be controlling the snow?

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
Good question. I don't recall any giant[sr]like that from Norse mythology offhand...

That's how things are supposed to go, but the further removed the higher-ups get from the action, the softer they get when it comes to making those calls.

[charaFace B 7]

＠Da Vinci
So in that sense, Director Goredolf[sr]is exceedingly good at his job.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I'm not sure why, but he seems to treat any danger his field operatives are in as danger to his own life.
[k]

[charaFace B 14]

I wonder what that's all about. Maybe he had[sr]a really strict tutor growing up or something.

Giants are beings from the Age of Gods. Not even mages have seen more than the occasional fossil of them.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Any survivors in areas where Mystics were still in full force were probably seen as threats, and taken out by the heroes of their respective ages.
[k]

[charaFace B 24]

＠Da Vinci
They're certainly not something[sr]you'd run into every day!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I mean, you guys didn't see hide nor hair of them in any of the seven eras you Rayshifted to, right? Not even in the actual Age of Gods.

[charaFace B 25]

And now we just happen to run into not one,[sr]but two, in modern-day Scandinavia!?

＠Holmes
I believe those giants you encountered were Jötnar[line 2]members of the Jötunn race of giants.
[k]

＠Holmes
In the Age of Gods,[sr]the Norse world was composed of nine realms.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_79 0.1 0.7]

＠Holmes
One such realm was Muspelheim, the land of flame. Another was Niflheim, the land of ice, through which an icy river of poison flowed.
[k]

＠Holmes
When these two realms collided, the poisonous frost melted. Then, when it was exposed to Muspelheim's heat, grew into a tremendous giant.
[k]

＠Holmes
This was Ymir,[sr]said to be the ancestor of all Norse giants.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Holmes
The race of giants that went on to spring forth from Ymir's body were called Jötunn, the frost giants.
[k]

＠Holmes
These giants were truly beings belonging[sr]to the era when gods walked the earth.
[k]

＠Holmes
At times, the Jötnar would mix with the Norse gods, giving birth to new gods and giants alike.
[k]

＠Holmes
It's said that the surviving Jötnar eventually fell out of mythology and went on to become trolls...
[k]

＠Holmes
...but what you two saw today were no trolls.[sr]They were most definitely Jötnar.

I shall take that under advisement, especially considering it comes from none other than the great Leonardo da Vinci herself.

All that said...I could certainly use a bit more information myself.

[charaFace C 6]

Is this simply a Norse Lostbelt where a once-lost race of giants still runs amok? No, I very much doubt that is all there is to it.

＠Holmes
Based on what we know from Russia, we can assume there is a being here who rules over this Lostbelt, and a Crypter who tends to the Tree of Emptiness.
[k]

＠Holmes
While our primary concern is with the latter, there remains a strong possibility that we will come into conflict with the former as well.
[k]

＠Holmes
That said, our goal this time does not include engaging them in battle. Our intent is to cross Scandinavia without them ever knowing we were here.
