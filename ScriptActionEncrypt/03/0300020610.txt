...The gate won't open, will it?
[k]

＠Grown-Up
No, Gerda. It only opens on the ordained day. Assuming you stay here and don't go out again, at least.
[k]

＠Gerda
I won't. Nobody has a fever right now.
[k]

＠Grown-Up
You did a good deed, Gerda, so the Goddess and the envoys will forgive you. That they didn't punish you is proof enough of that, right?
[k]

＠Grown-Up
Still...the gate won't open...
[k]

＠Grown-Up
I wonder if we really will have to wait for the next ordained day to set off on our journey, like he said we would.

An envoy only comes on the ordained day. The Goddess hasn't permitted them to descend from Valhalla any other time.

All right then, let's start at the beginning.[sr]You two know about the myth of Ragnarök, right?

＠Napoleon
Well, in this Lostbelt, it looks like the last war between the gods and giants still took place...
[k]

＠Napoleon
...but, as you've likely figured out for yourselves,[sr]the Age of Gods didn't end here for some reason.
[k]

＠Napoleon
Thanks to that, civilization never developed, humans are still worshipping gods, and giants roam unchecked around the mountains.
[k]

＠Napoleon
Basically, for the last three thousand or so years, things have remained pretty much the same as they were back in 1000 B.C., when the Norse Age of Gods was originally meant to end.
[k]

＠Napoleon
That's what led to this place heading down a sliiightly different path from the myth we know.

＠Napoleon
She didn't die in Ragnarök or turn into a Divine Spirit.[sr]She's remained, intact, to this day.
[k]

＠Napoleon
Now, she rules this Lostbelt, using her hundred envoys as a go-between to keep both the giants and humans in check.
[k]

＠Napoleon
She's the last god in Scandinavia, and she's kept the Age of Gods going all this time.

She lives in the northern part of the Oslo Fjord, in a castle located in Proper Human History's old Oslo region.

Hahahahaha, of course not! You're a riot, mademoiselle! Can you imagine an emperor like me going around with a cannon like this!?

＠Napoleon
Wait, guess I shouldn't laugh, huh? Sorry about that.[sr]It's just not that uncommon in modern Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Napoleon
I don't know what sort of adventures you've gotten up to before, but haven't you seen anything like this with other modern Heroic Spirits from Proper Human History?

＠Napoleon
You know, where they turned out to be kind[sr]of a caricature of their real selves?

＠Napoleon
The envoys aren't allowed to sacrifice humans on any day besides the one that goddess lady[line 2]Scáthach-Skadi ordained.

So they must've brought a whole bunch of them along to make sure the ritual didn't go off the rails again.

His expedition to Russia. The winter there was too harsh for his Grande Armée to endure, which ultimately led their defeat.

Apparently, that defeat was a major factor in the decline of his reign...
