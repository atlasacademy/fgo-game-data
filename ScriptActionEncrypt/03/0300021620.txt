＠Meunière
I'm about to really kick it into gear here! If you're not a Heroic Spirit, make sure you're strapped in good and tight, or you're liable to bite your tongue off!
[k]

＠Goredolf
Whooooooa! We're bouncing all over the place! I know this isn't exactly the time to be obeying traffic laws, but you will NOT flip us over, Piccata!
[k]

[shakeStop]

＠Meunière
It's not Piccata! It's Meunière! And I'm just getting the hang of the control stick, dammit!
[k]

＠Meunière
...Hey, where'd Holmes run off to, anyway!?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He said he'd talked too much and went back to the recovery pod. Mr. Great Detective pretty much just woke up to assess the situation and negotiate a bit!
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
What an astonishing man! To think he remained so calm and collected even despite his many injuries.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
I take it this “recovery pod” is off that way?[sr]I shall grace him with one of my healing runes.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Freyja, Ortlinde, come with me.
[k]

＠Sitonai
Ugh, how many times do I have to tell you?[sr]My name is Illya. But, fine, I'll go with you.
[k]

＠Ortlinde
Understood.
[k]

＠Meunière
Man, imagine getting nursed back[sr]to health by an actual goddess...
[k]

＠Meunière
But that doesn't excuse Holmes's sheer recklessness![sr]Not that he's the only one here guilty of that!
[k]

＠Goredolf
Heh, well, there's only so much a man of his meager abilities can do. Not everyone can be blessed with an abundance of talent like myself, after all.
[k]

＠Goredolf
And let me be clear about one thing: I am not like the rest of you. I have no craving whatsoever for adventure!
[k]

＠Goredolf
A good commander in chief always assesses the[sr]situation calmly, deploys the right people to the right places, and ensures his organization runs as smoothly as [wt 0.5][messageShake 0.05 3 2 1.0]pthhible.

Oh for... I TOLD you to be careful you don't bite your tongue! How are things over with you, [%1]!?

In addition to the flying types, there are also some running along the ground and trying to attach themselves to the Border!

You know the massive magical energy signature we saw up in the northern part of old Sweden?

Well, I'm pretty sure it's Surtr, and he's heading south fast! You know what this means!?

For example, something that exists atop old Lake Vänern...

Guess that means he got himself connected to the tree then. Dammit, now we've got to reverse course!

Still, we can't just sit around complaining![sr]If it gets us closer to him, well, so much the better!
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Napoleon
After all, I was really hoping[sr]to avoid a situation...
[k]

＠Napoleon
...where I'd have to try sniping at extreme range with my cannon because we couldn't catch him.

[charaFace C 6]

So in that respect, this has worked out nicely! Phew!

I wish I knew why he was headed there, though... That flaming sword of his is absurdly powerful. He could use it anywhere, and it'd still be just as destructive.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So why go so far out of his way for one village?[sr]Hmm. Does he just want to make us watch it burn?

I doubt he'd bother doing something like that.

I think Sigurd is right. Doesn't seem like he cares much about gods or Heroic Spirits.
[k]

＠Napoleon
I do have a thought about what he might be up to...[sr]But that's not important!

All that matters is that this is a stroke of luck for my Grande Armée! It's about time I got serious, anyway!

...but at this point, it's looking clear[sr]that I need to get really, REALLY serious.

Plus, I've still got my trump card! Not that I'd ever play that in the opening act before things really get going, of course!
