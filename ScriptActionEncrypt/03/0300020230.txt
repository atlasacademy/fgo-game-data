...The battle is over.[bgm BGM_EVENT_81 0.1][sr]We've neutralized the threat.

？1：Mash, you're looking really tired...
？2：Why don't we head back to the Border?

？！

＠Mash
...Thank you for your concern, Master...but I'm all right.

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
The sudden attack just had me a little out of breath is all. It's nothing to worry about.
[k]

＠Mash
All my vital signs are fine.[sr]I'm still good to go.

I'm doing my best to analyze the recording and battle data now, but...at this point, I can only say that the creature you fought is like nothing we've seen.
[k]

＠Holmes
Neither a Heroic Spirit, nor a Demonic Beast.
[k]

＠Holmes
He was simply an enormous humanoid creature native to Scandinavia. One that could not possibly exist in the twenty-first century.

？2：As in mythical giants?

？！

＠Mash
I read that...a number of powerful[sr]giants used to live in Scandinavia.
[k]

＠Mash
Of course, this was all a long time ago.
[k]

＠Mash
In the modern era, there have barely been any giant sightings in Sweden, Denmark, or Norway.
[k]

＠Mash
I believe most of them were during the Age of Gods...back when the old Mystics still existed.
[k]

[charaFace A 15]

＠Mash
I'm sure there are some exceptions, but even so,[sr]to encounter one out of nowhere like this...

Both Goredolf and Mr. Meunière are in something of a tizzy about this impossible encounter, but yes, in the year 2020, giants have long since ceased to exist.
[k]

＠Holmes
And yet, you've obviously just met one. Albeit one that tried to kill you even after you attempted to communicate with him, but still.

So in this version of Scandinavia, creatures from the Age of Gods still live. That is most troubling. I had considered the possibility, but I didn't think it would prove to be true so soon.
[k]

[charaFace F 2]

＠Holmes
Damn you, Crypters! Damn you for throwing something like this at us in only the second Lostbelt! Have you no sense of restraint!?

That said, we are far from completely helpless.[sr]Ms. Kyrielight. [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].
[k]

＠Holmes
To begin, I've updated our database with everything[sr]I could determine about this creature.
[k]

＠Holmes
We were unable to detect it from the Border because Chaldea had no information about ancient giants.
[k]

＠Holmes
Furthermore, I also learned something rather unexpected about the ice and snow surrounding us...

They are imbued with a faint magical energy. The trace is so minute that only an expert mage would even be able to detect it at all!
[k]

＠Holmes
This small amount of magical energy created enough interference in our equipment that we were unable to detect the giant's approach.
[k]

[charaFace F 6]

＠Holmes
Da Vinci is still quite upset about it. She says being plugged in to function as a bio unit dulls her senses.
[k]

＠Holmes
Nonetheless, I'll do my best to update our data immediately. I'm also sending an update for the Ortinax's firmware.

I'm picking up new hostiles in our periphery...! There's at least one...two...no, several ice beasts traveling alongside another giant!
