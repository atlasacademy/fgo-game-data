Qin Shi Huang is from the B.C. era.[sr]How could he possibly still be alive in 2020?

Well, normally you'd be right. But are you forgetting the tsar we just recently fought who had been living for around five hundred years?

So is it REALLY such a stretch that a Chinese emperor might have managed to survive over two thousand years?

The Qin empire had a legal system, standardized units of measurement, paper money... It was very much ahead of its time in many ways.
[k]

＠Holmes
China would go on to see the rise[sr]and fall of many other dynasties...
[k]

＠Holmes
...but when it comes to making progress as a civilization, such instability is...unhelpful.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Holmes
If Qin had remained as the sole power in China, no doubt it would have reached a point where it would easily swallow up neighboring countries...
[k]

...which could, in turn, have sped up humanity's overall progress considerably.

In which case, if Qin Shi Huang somehow succeeded at becoming immortal in this history, much like how Ivan the Terrible did so by becoming a Yaga...
