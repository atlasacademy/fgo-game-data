It doesn't look like there'll be any blizzard. Looks like today's forecast for the southern Sweden region of this Lostbelt is clear skies.

＠Mash
I'm all set, Senpai.

Plus I've already gone and put up an[sr]extra sturdy Bounded Field around it anyway!

And it's not just sturdy. I made sure none of the indigenous life would even be able to tell it's there, especially the giants.

The ice and snow here are infused with magical energy, which'll get in the way no matter what, so we won't be able to talk to each other once you're more than a few kilometers out.

But that doesn't mean I'm giving up. I've still[sr]got a few ideas I'll try when I get the chance.
