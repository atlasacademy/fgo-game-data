No, I really mean it.[sr]Don't be stupid[line 2]of COURSE I killed him.
[k]

＠???
Yes, I killed Amadeus myself.[sr]I am the one who requested the Requiem in D minor.
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠???
It was I! I am the reason the great prodigy is dead!
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠???
...Preposterous.[sr]How fortunate I would be if only that were true.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠???
I COULDN'T kill him. I just couldn't.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠???
Not because we were good friends, or even acquaintances, but because I couldn't bring myself to snuff out the life of one with such God-given talent.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠???
That is who Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was.
[k]

[charaFace A 10]

＠???
And yet, the world, myself included, cannot but seek someone to blame for the death of one such as he.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠???
So we told ourselves that some fool must have driven him to the depths of hell, all because they envied his divine symphonies!
[k]

＠???
And all so that we could avoid facing the most hellish truth ourselves: that even a composer of his incredible talent could die as easily as anyone else!
[k]

＠???
That is how I was remade.[sr]Yes, remade!
[k]

[charaFace A 2]

＠???
But that's okay! That's how it should be!
[k]

＠???
I loved him. I envied him. I yearned for him. I respected him, admired him, looked up to him...
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠???
So...to bear the honor of being the one to kill that[sr]great prodigy, I could ask no greater gift of God!
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠???
Still, that said...
[k]

＠???
...I feel like...he once told me something...[sr]Something...much more important...
