She's strong. Really strong. You can tell she was around in the Age of Gods.

We won today because of her.

[charaFace G 0]

＠Napoleon
Using the right people for the right job is as crucial on the battlefield as it is anywhere else. Having her on our side turned out to be really effective.
[k]

＠Napoleon
You saw it yourself. Even the Valkyrie commanders were afraid to face her, to say nothing of the others.

That went really well for us. Losing two commanders makes the Valkyries that much less of a threat.

[charaFace G 10]

From what I hear...Brynhild used[sr]to be something of a model Valkyrie.
[k]

＠Napoleon
She was an autonomous machine who would harvest heroes' souls and bring them back to Valhalla for Ragnarök.
[k]

＠Napoleon
Apparently, the souls she and the other Valkyries gathered were supposed to serve as Odin's army.
[k]

＠Napoleon
So she followed her orders[sr]and collected souls for Odin.

[charaFace G 0]

＠Napoleon
But one day, she ended up guiding a warrior[sr]to victory who wasn't the one Odin wanted.

That was when the great hero, Sigurd, showed up.
[k]

He used his demonic sword to cut through all the divine shields around the palace and rescued Brynhild.
[k]

＠
He knew of King Grípir's prophecy that said rescuing her would lead to his own death, but that didn't stop him.
[k]

＠
It didn't take them long to fall in love after that.
[k]

Brynhild taught him all sorts of things, including knowledge of secret runes, and they only grew closer over time...

But in the end, they were never able to be wed.

There was another woman named Guðrún who was in love with Sigurd, and hatched a plan to make him hers.
[k]

＠
First, Sigurd was made to take a magical elixir,[sr]which erased his memories of Brynhild...
[k]

＠
After that, he was told many, many lies,[sr]leading to Brynhild's betrothal to Gunnar.
[k]

＠
Of course, Brynhild didn't want any part of that, and told Gunnar she would only marry him if he managed to overcome a series of perilous trials.
[k]

＠
But then, in a particularly cruel twist of fate, Sigurd used the runes she taught him to transform into Gunnar, and completed the trials for him.
[k]

＠
And so, Brynhild ended up marrying Gunnar after all.

＠
It was the worst. Every single one of these people was the worst. Poor Brynhild.

I used to be an inhuman Valkyrie. I was a being who lacked a human heart, just like my sisters.

The souls that the other Valkyries and I harvested were intended to serve in Odin's army.
