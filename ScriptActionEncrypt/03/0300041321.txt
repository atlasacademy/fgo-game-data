We drove away other sacred beasts and defeated Nezha here only a few days ago. Unfortunately, it is no surprise that this town may have drawn the enemy's notice...

I-it's all right, Lady Lakshmi. This wasn't your fault.[sr]We just weren't strong enough.
[k]

＠Woman
There were more of them than we were expecting, and some were bigger than any sacred beast we'd ever seen before.
[k]

＠Woman
Besides, they may have crushed our wall and destroyed our homes, but we still have our lives.

Forget fighting back. You can't even live here with your village in ruins like this.

＠Rama
Based on my experience as a king, my suggestion is to abandon the village. I think that is your only choice.

I understand how you feel, but there is just no way you can rebuild your defenses before the next Kali Yuga.

＠Rama
As I see it, your only option is to stay in the closest nearby town[line 2]I think that would be Bichu[line 2]until the Kali Yuga is over.

I hate to leave the village I grew up in...but we can always rebuild. We can't bring people back to life.
