Agreed. But I expect things will be okay.

This town knows how to do more than just pray now. We will help them all we can, then make our escape when the time is right.

＠Rama
They should be more than capable of surviving until the next yuga cycle begins by then.

This isn't good. We only taught these people how to handle normal kali. That giant one is in a whole other league!
