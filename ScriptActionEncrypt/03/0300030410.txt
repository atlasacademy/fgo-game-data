Impressive. Even if this precision is only possible when embarking from the Wandering Sea, it is quite something to behold.
[k]

＠Holmes
What's more, Ms. Sion tells me that we can expect this level of precision anywhere except the North and South Poles.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Holmes
Unfortunately, we may have been a little too precise. At this distance, our only choice is to head straight into the storm wall immediately.

Mr. Goredolf, how are you[line 2]

How about you, [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1]?[sr]Are you ready for this next phase?

Good. Ms. Sion was kind enough to make some[sr]significant improvements to your Mystic Code.
[k]

＠Holmes
It should be a good deal more useful both in keeping you alive and in aiding your performance as a Master.

[51ffff]Not only will this greatly improve our odds of emerging from Void Space, we can also ask her about an antidote once we capture her![-]

＠Holmes
Very well then. In light of this new information,[sr]I believe a new course of action is in order.
[k]

＠Holmes
We should cancel our search for Xiān Shuāi Míng Mài[sr]in favor of capturing Koyanskaya.
[k]

＠Holmes
That would be a much surer way of neutralizing the poison Goredolf and [%1] consumed...
[k]

＠Holmes
...and it would be one less[sr]threat to our future endeavors.
[k]

＠Holmes
As for the Crypter and the Tree of Emptiness, our goals there would remain unchanged. We find and restrain the former, and cut down the latter.
[k]

＠Holmes
Would that be acceptable to you, Director?

[51ffff]And even if we succeed at that, it won't amount to anything if we can't make her tell us where to find or how to make the antidote.[-]
