So THAT'S what's going on here.

This place is a Lostbelt... A different world where the Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon is still taking place.

＠Musashi
So now, you're after the bad guys[line 2]Crypters,[sr]you called 'em?[line 2]who ruined the world.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Musashi
And on top of THAT, the hot gunslinger[sr]you've got with you is Billy the Kid!
[k]

＠Musashi
I hoped that might be the case when I heard[sr]you call him Billy, and I was totally right!
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Musashi
This is great. This is so great! (Squee)

＠Musashi
...[sr]...

？1：No rattling your sword at Billy.

[charaFace D 10]

＠Musashi
Whoa, how did you know?
[k]

？2：No dueling our allies.

Sorry. Old habits and all that. Besides, a quick-draw battle between a gunslinger and a swordsman?
[k]

＠Musashi
How could I NOT want to see which of us would win?
[k]

＠Musashi
Granted, I've already won a number of quick-draw battles with other gunslingers, but Billy the Kid's GOT to be on a whole other level.

Is it true you can fire off three rounds between a man's eyes before he's even had time to blink? You ARE supposed to be faster than lightning, right?
[k]

＠Billy
'Course I am. Plenty of folks've come to see if those rumors were true, and they've gotten more'n two or three rounds between the eyes for their trouble!
[k]

[charaFace C 1]

＠Billy
This ain't really the place, though. Too closed in. You're plannin' to deflect anythin' I fire and rush me for the kill, ain'tcha?
[k]

＠Billy
Probably cap the whole thing off by sayin' somethin' 'bout how you was only lookin' to see who's faster, then just mosey along.

I doubt it'll give us a straight shot to the exit,[sr]but it oughta at least give us an idea where to go.

＠Billy
Only thing is that I ain't really got the ear to figure out the change in the sound. Keen hearin' ain't really my strong suit.

The front path leads to a dead end, and the left side takes us back to where we were. There's a staircase leading up if we go diagonally.

I had to save bits and pieces of these creatures to eat so I could keep a minimum of magical energy going when I was on my own, but now that I've got a Master, the sky's the limit.

No more worrying about keeping the tasty bits intact.[sr]Time to show these things what I can really do!
