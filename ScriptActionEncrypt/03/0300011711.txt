＠Atalante Alter
Did you get them?
[k]

＠Avicebron
I did. My golems caught the stragglers[sr]when they tried to escape.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
...Your golems really are a[sr]terrifying force in large numbers.
[k]

＠Avicebron
I suppose so.
[k]

＠Avicebron
I can make as many as I want as long[sr]as my magical energy holds out.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Atalante Alter
True, yes, but what I find most unnerving about them is the sheer speed with which you make them.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Atalante Alter
It is as though you carry a small army you can produce almost instantly wherever you go.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Atalante Alter
I shudder to think what could happen if you had[sr]gone into the military, rather than philosophy...
[k]

[charaFace A 1]

＠Atalante Alter
...though I imagine those you count as your[sr]enemies would be shuddering all the more.
[k]

＠Avicebron
I'm afraid I never had any interest in pursuing glory on the battlefield. That is, perhaps, for the best.
[k]

＠Avicebron
But never mind that. I believe we should[sr]be reaching this ravine you mentioned soon.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Atalante Alter
Indeed.
