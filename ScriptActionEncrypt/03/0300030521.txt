If they've got the science and engineering know-how to build a metropolis like this, then they've come way farther technologically than we thought.

Perhaps magecraft is used openly here. Either that, or they really have advanced scientifically to the point where they can control gravity.

That's not even the best part. It stretches along the entire observable sky of the Lostbelt.

Then how come we couldn't see it before entering this Lostbelt? If it's two thousand kilometers up, that's gotta put it above the storm clouds, right?

Hmm, this emperor's much more laid back than I thought. I expected a bit more eagerness to take down the threats to their empire.

I had hoped for the same. Nothing ever seems to go as planned with the emperor. But...oh well. That isn't going to change.

Well, sorry you ended up having to[sr]do all the work in consequence.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I do hope it won't take you too long to finish them off.

[charaFace A 5]

＠Akuta Hinako
...Is that all you have to say for yourself,[sr]after all the trouble you've caused?
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Koyanskaya
Eeek! Please don't glare at me like that, Akuta.[sr]You're gonna make me cry☆
[k]

[charaFace B 17]

＠Koyanskaya
We're on the same side in all of this!
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Besides, isn't the Master of Chaldea[sr]every Crypter's sworn enemy?
[k]

＠Akuta Hinako
Of course. You could have lured [&him:her] to any of the[sr]others' territories, and any of them would've made[sr]sure to finish [&him:her] off.
[k]

＠Akuta Hinako
I would go so far as to say any one of them would[sr]be a better pick for this kind of work than me.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]

＠Akuta Hinako
So why did you have to bring them to China? They're only here because they were following you, right?[sr]Thank you so much for that.
[k]

[charaFace B 16]

＠Koyanskaya
Aww, don't be so hard on yourself, Akuta. I really thought you would be the best fit for the job, seeing how you're so good at defense and all.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
You see, I actually tried to assassinate[sr][&him:her] as a favor to Beryl...
[k]

[charaFace B 9]
＠Koyanskaya
...but I'm afraid things didn't[sr]exactly go as planned☆
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
See, the poison I used is called[sr]Xiān Shuāi Míng Mài, and...
[k]

[charaFace B 17]
＠Koyanskaya
Well, I don't suppose you already[sr]know what it is, do you?

No, I didn't. This time, I only[sr]had about ten percent of a plan.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Koyanskaya
That's why I wasted no time coming to warn you, Akuta. I wanted to take responsibility, see!
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I mean, Chaldea's got the world's greatest inventor and greatest detective on their side now, right?
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I knew it wouldn't take them long at all[sr]to figure out where the poison came from.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
So I thought, instead of wasting time trying to sweep this under the rug, it would be much better to fortify our defenses now.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
So here I am, warning you about the[sr]danger and taking responsibility!
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
It's not like you and I are complete strangers, right? So I thought I could help you out with getting rid of Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace B 21]

[charaFace A 11]
＠Akuta Hinako
But that still doesn't explain why you brought those dangerous pets of yours along.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Koyanskaya
Pets? Perish the thought.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
They have their dignity, at least as far as wild animals go.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Akuta Hinako
So you didn't order them to go around killing people?
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Of course not. Why would I rob myself of the pleasure of torturing and killing humans?
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
No, they're just doing their best to survive and find food in an environment they're not used to.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Don't you find that far more endearing than a bunch of defanged livestock, like this nation's people?
[k]

[charaFace A 8]

＠Akuta Hinako
That's not the problem, and you know it. How could you set Demonic Beasts from another Lostbelt loose here?
[k]

＠Akuta Hinako
If the emperor finds out you're the one responsible for them, you will find yourself in real trouble.

＠Koyanskaya
You have your own life's work you've devoted yourself to, don't you, Akuta? So I think we'll both be happier if we just stay out of each other's way.
