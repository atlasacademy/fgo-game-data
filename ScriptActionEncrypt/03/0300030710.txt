Nope, never. What are those things, anyway? At first I was freaking out 'cause I thought you'd killed 'em...
[k]

＠Farmer A
...but then I saw they didn't bleed even when their limbs broke off, so I thought they might be scarecrows. But makin' scarecrows that complex seems kinda pointless, so now I dunno what to think...

C'mon, what kind of scarecrow[sr]would go around picking fights?

Tell me, what do you make of the villagers' reactions?

？1：They're very...laid back.
？2：They really took all this in stride. Maybe too much so.
？！

[charaFace B 0]

＠Holmes
Indeed, they seemed to be completely oblivious to the danger. They were far more worked up when they found us trampling their fields.
[k]

＠Holmes
I can understand how they might regard our fight with Akuta as something that doesn't concern them.
[k]

＠Holmes
But the same cannot be said for these mechanical dolls.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]
＠Holmes
Akuta Hinako did not bring these over from Proper Human History. This technology is foreign to us.
[k]

＠Holmes
What's more, Xianyang clearly sent[sr]them to her to reinforce her.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
All this leads me to believe these automata are a type of weapon native to this world. And yet, the people who live here claim never to have seen them before.

We can assume that Akuta has formed an alliance with this world's ruler, just like we've seen in previous Lostbelts.
[k]

＠Holmes
For the moment, let us further assume this[sr]ruler is, in fact, Qin Shi Huang.
[k]

＠Holmes
If true, it is certainly sensible that he would send these automata to aid her in battle.
[k]

＠Holmes
It then stands to reason that, on seeing us fight their nation's armed forces, these farmers would see us as a threat and treat us accordingly.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]
＠Holmes
And yet...that proves not to be the case...

In which case, I can draw only one conclusion.

＠Holmes
Which is that these villagers are so wholly ignorant[sr]of war that they do not even know weaponry.

It is. However, we all saw that their fight or flight reflex tended toward the former on our initial encounter.
