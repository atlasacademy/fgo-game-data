...There. You see that? I know you did.
[k]

＠
Before I knew it, a smile of[sr]pure joy spread across my face.
[k]

＠
After an incredibly hard-won victory, all [&he:she][sr]got in return is the worst outcome imaginable.
[k]

＠
Death, at the hands of those[sr][&he:she] thought [&he:she] had saved...
[k]

＠
...and the knowledge that the world [&he:she] worked[sr]so hard to save would ultimately be destroyed.
[k]

＠
...That's all [&he:she] has to show for [&his:her] efforts, even after[sr][&he:she] finally managed to bring down Ivan the Terrible.
[k]

＠
That's the reward [&he:she] got for not only standing up to, but actually defeating that mountain of a tsar.
[k]

＠
[&He:She] fought so bravely, and now look at [&him:her]. [&He:She] looks[sr]so weak it's all [&he:she] can do just to stay on [&his:her] feet.
[k]

＠
...If I wanted to, I could[sr]easily kill [&him:her] myself now.
[k]

＠
Even as I thought that, I found myself running.
[k]

＠
Bowstrings are pulled back.[sr]Bullets are loaded into their chambers.
[k]

＠
My legs keep moving. I can't hold back any longer.
[k]

＠
I think back to a street performer I saw when I was a child, and how he kept laughing idiotically at his own comical antics.
[k]

＠
...Hmph. He was the only one there laughing, that's for sure. As if anyone could ever put food on the table doing something so completely useless. Pathetic.
[k]

＠
...But when did it become normal for us to see that sort of stuff as pathetic? When did we Yaga lose our ability to smile?
[k]

＠
I keep running. As a Yaga, I've never been afraid of anything. I've always known death was inevitable.
[k]

If there's anything I AM scared of, I think...
