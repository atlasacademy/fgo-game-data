I appreciate you reacting exactly[sr]how I thought you would.

You must have known the Chaldeans were hot on your tail, yet you couldn't ignore my aura and couldn't resist waiting around for me to show up...

[charaFace B 28]

＠Koyanskaya
I'm so glad you're as simpleminded as you look.[sr]Now, let's get to our grudge match, shall we?
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Oh, but do be warned: you'll be facing[sr][%1] and [&his:her] team this time around, and they're veeery tough cookies.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
You see, they do this ungodly annoying thing where they get stronger and stronger each time they do battle.

I thought I could, but it seems this problem is not as easily solved with words as I had hoped.

We'll just have to pin him down and have him cool off more naturally.

Well, I'm certainly less awkward than you. I keep my life nice and simple by doing whatever it takes to stay alive.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]

＠Peperoncino
Of course, that still leaves the question of what I want to do with my life once I keep it. It's not easy being human, you know? We always want more.

Hmph. Guess you really must be adroit if you can say that sort of thing with a smile. Maybe I am kind of awkward by comparison.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
All I've got going for me is my anger. So it's only natural that anger would become my entire life.
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
Living my life makes me angry, and my anger gives me a reason to live. Yeah, I know it doesn't make any sense.
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Aśvatthāman
Just like I know that the moment my anger dies out,[sr]I won't be me anymore!
[k]

＠Aśvatthāman
So as long as I'm still kicking, I've got no choice but to keep my fury burning...to keep burning my whole damn life!
