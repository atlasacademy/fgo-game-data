Don't worry, she's a venerated hero in her own right. I'm sure she'll be fine.
[k]

＠Rama
She said it herself, she's somewhat similar to us in certain ways.
[k]

＠Rama
I do agree that her tendency to rush headlong toward her goals with a single-minded earnestness has the potential to cause trouble...
[k]

＠Rama
...but I also doubt there are few who can keep up with her sheer airborne maneuverability.
