Xianyang just fired another rocket. It looks like[sr]it's aimed straight at us, just like the first one.
[k]

？1：Think this one is more supplies for Hinako?
？！

＠Da Vinci
I doubt it. I'm guessing it's[sr]either a direct attack...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...or it's carrying soldiers that can handle a rough ride, like when Akuta and that prince first showed up.

Given that this civilization has produced humanoid mechanical soldiers, there is no telling what could be coming next.

That said...there has been something strange[sr]about this Lostbelt from the very beginning.

When Kadoc and Ophelia came to fight us with their Servants, they tended to bide their time, waiting for us to be weakened by other enemies.
[k]

＠Holmes
But Akuta hardly waited a moment[sr]before coming after us.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Holmes
Why do you think that is?
[k]

？1：Because there was no one else who could fight?
？！

[charaFace B 0]
＠Holmes
That would seem to be the foremost possibility.
[k]

＠Holmes
Especially since this world is so peaceful, its people are completely unfamiliar with the concept of war.
[k]

＠Holmes
It may well be that this Lostbelt's ruler has no military force capable of engaging Servants.

Hmm. Makes sense to me. Standing armies[sr]are nothing more than walking money pits.

Keeping one around without an enemy[sr]to fight just wouldn't make sense.

And if there's no army here, this Lostbelt[sr]will be all the easier to deal with.
[k]

＠Holmes
While we should refrain from getting our hopes up, I believe we are about to see Xianyang's first attack sans Akuta.
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Holmes
This battle will tell us a great deal[sr]about this world's military strength.
