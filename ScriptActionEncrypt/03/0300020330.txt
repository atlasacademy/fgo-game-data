It's coming along well. Even now, it continues to grow larger in its garden, away from any who might observe or interfere.

＠Ophelia
Since there is no opposing faction in this Scandinavian Lostbelt, there should be nothing to interfere with its growth.
[k]

＠Queen of Ice and Snow
Faction?[sr]I must confess I am unfamiliar with that word.
[k]

＠Queen of Ice and Snow
I suppose we do hear the occasional lone wolf howl, but that is of no consequence. If anything, it helps to pass the time.

＠Queen of Ice and Snow
Still...I suppose if they were to form a pack, that could be somewhat troublesome. Don't you agree, Ophelia?

[charaFace B 4]

＠Ophelia
...Yes, I do.
[k]

＠Queen of Ice and Snow
My world[line 2]my Scandinavia[line 2]is a land where peace reigns far and wide. There has never been conflict among its people. Not once.
[k]

＠Queen of Ice and Snow
The wild beasts do devour their prey,[sr]of course, but that is as far as it goes.
[k]

＠Queen of Ice and Snow
Pointless conflict is a foreign concept to man and beast alike...as is resentment.

I do. Under your rule, this world of Scandinavia has become one of the great embodiments of peace.
[k]

Hehe, the way you say that, Ophelia, it sounds as though there are other worlds that have achieved similar peace. How adorable.
[k]

＠Ophelia
...Surely you jest.
[k]

＠Ophelia
...This Lostbelt's stability is[sr]of vital importance, Your Majesty.

＠Ophelia
It is the key to growing our tree.[sr]All you need do is continue ruling as you always have.

＠Queen of Ice and Snow
Hmm.

＠Queen of Ice and Snow
You truly are a selfless young woman,[sr]aren't you, Ophelia Phamrsolone?

I suppose I should commend you for your diligence...but it takes more than that to be a queen.

As I preside over all that is pure white, nothing can elude me. I know and see all that takes place within my land.

That goes for the crew of this Shadow Border as well. As I speak, they are erecting a Bounded Field to keep the giants away.
