Sigurd the Dragon Slayer, wielder of a demonic sword, and great hero of Norse legend.

I'm not sure if his exploits took place during the Age of Gods or the A.D. era, and Freyja won't tell me.

...I can at least say this much about the red-eyed Heroic Spirit who serves the Crypter:
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_81 0.1]

He is not a Lostbelt Servant.

Or, at least, his Spirit Origin comes from Proper Human History. Freyja is shouting that much!

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
I'm not absolutely certain, but when we observed his magical energy in the Shadow Border, it was very different from a Servant of Proper Human History.

And when we fought him earlier, his magical energy clearly belonged to a Lostbelt Servant...!

[charaFace D 14]

＠Sitonai
So I want you to do your best to get it,[sr]and then fight him with everything you've got!

Once you defeat Sigurd and recover the Paper Moon, you can make that Crypter tell you where the tree is.

Ooor you could just kill her[sr]and find the tree yourselves.
