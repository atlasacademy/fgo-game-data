Hmm. Funny how you're okay without sleep, but the Divine Spirit Servant over there apparently can't get enough...

[charaFace B 1]

＠Peperoncino
Well, that's okay. This works out nicely for me.[sr]Mind if I stand watch with you for a while?

That was only a pretense, of course. I was actually just waiting for a good chance to ask you this.

...Yes, I did.
[k]

＠Mash
We didn't have a lot of time...but I still feel like we said a lot.
[k]

＠Mash
Much more than we ever expressed[sr]to each other in Chaldea.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Peperoncino
Hehe, I'm glad to hear that.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
She always did want to have a good heart-to-heart with you. I could tell.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Peperoncino
So? What'd you talk about?
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Well, one of our topics...

...was romance.

No way! Seriously?

＠Peperoncino
Aww, what I wouldn't give to have[sr]been a fly on the wall for that!
[k]

＠Peperoncino
I can't think of anything better than Ophelia talking about romance.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
I can just imagine the three of us chatting over a nice cup of tea, hours passing in the blink of an eye...

Do you...know what happened to everyone, Pepe...?
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Peperoncino
I heard what happened from Kirschtaria and the others, yes. But those are just boring old facts. That's not what I really want to know.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
That's why I wanted to ask you about them directly.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
...I see. I don't think there's anything I need to keep secret, so I'm happy to answer any questions you have.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Peperoncino
Even though I'm a Crypter? Even though I'm your enemy?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
Yes. I remembered that, despite everything that's happened...we were still both members of Team A.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
That hasn't changed just because[sr]you're a Crypter now, too.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Peperoncino
I see. Well thank you.

＠Peperoncino
I'm sure Kadoc, Ophelia, and Akuta are frustrated by how things turned out...but I doubt they have any regrets.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Peperoncino
So they all fought bravely, huh. And here I am,[sr]just pathetically doing whatever I can to survive.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
I don't think that's anything[sr]you need to feel bad about...
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Peperoncino
Hey, I'm still on the Crypters' side.[sr]I can't help but be frustrated too.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Peperoncino
No matter how hard it is to survive...I still find myself thinking there might've been a better way to end things.

Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring down the mood.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
If things don't go your way even after you've struggled as much as you can, your only choice is to give up and move on. I just had to come to terms with that again.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
That's just my lot in life, I'm afraid.[sr]Nothing I do ever quite seems to work out.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
Really? But, you've always seemed to me like you excel at everything you do...
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Peperoncino
Hehe. That's only because I stick to things I know I can do. No, I'm talking about fate and destiny...
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Peperoncino
But hey, that can be extremely motivating in its own right. And it's not like I've given up on everything, you know?
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
...
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠Peperoncino
All right, I think it's time I got to bed.[sr]A complexion this perfect requires pleeenty of sleep.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Besides, how could I look Ophelia in the eye if I neglected my own skin care after I kept admonishing her?
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Peperoncino
...Thank you for telling me what happened with the other Crypters, Mashie. Good night.
[k]

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Of course. Good night, Pepe...
