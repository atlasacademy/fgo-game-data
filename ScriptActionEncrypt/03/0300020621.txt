Then again, both those things and the giants are loyal to the queen, so it makes sense they might fight side by side.

＠Napoleon
Here, let me give you some tips for hunting giants.[sr]First off, try to go for their sensory organs or legs.
[k]

＠Napoleon
That's your best bet unless you've got a real powerhouse of a weapon. If so, you can just go for the vitals and take 'em out in one shot!

[charaFadeout B 0.1]
[wt 0.1]

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 0]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠Napoleon
That's right. The head's full of sensory organs. Those masks they wear cover up their eyes and noses, and it doesn't look like their hearing is exceptional...
[k]

＠Napoleon
...so they might be relying on some kind of sixth sense, or an ability that lets them detect heat sources, but I figure the eyes are a safe bet.
[k]

＠Napoleon
So make sure you go for their heads, even if you have to hit 'em through their masks. They're a big target, so it shouldn't be too tough to damage them.
[k]

＠Napoleon
When going for the legs,[sr]the knees and ankles are the best targets.
[k]

＠Napoleon
The giants' size and mass can be intimidating, but once you've knocked 'em to the ground, they're pretty much sitting ducks.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Napoleon
In other words, there's nothing too special about it.[sr]Just follow best practice.

[charaFace A 10]

Can we only win by wiping out the enemy? No. We can't possibly kill every giant and envoy in Scandinavia, and we wouldn't want to.

It may end up being after we've made contact with the Wandering Sea, but we will eventually need to destroy it and...

＠Napoleon
Get this Paper Moon thing back, and find out what you can about the Tree of Emptiness.
[k]

＠Napoleon
So what is your defeat condition?[sr]Easy: you both end up dead.
[k]

＠Napoleon
So your only choice is to keep yourselves safe and set about meeting your victory condition.

If it were just a matter of defeating your enemies, things would be simple. Unfortunately, your condition for victory is pretty far from straightforward.
