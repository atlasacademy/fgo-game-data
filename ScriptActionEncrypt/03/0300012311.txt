＠Ivan the Terrible
Ah... Aah... Aaaaaah...[sr]So, this... This is the end...
[k]

＠Ivan the Terrible
And you...you stand here,[sr]though you still lack resolve...
[k]

＠Ivan the Terrible
How fitting for one from the realm of the weak[sr]that is Proper Human History... And yet...
[k]

＠Ivan the Terrible
That grief you hold in your heart... Your empathy for others... We Yaga no longer have the capacity for it...
[k]

＠Ivan the Terrible
You may be weak, but you are also...happy...[sr]Yes... I remember now...
[k]

＠Ivan the Terrible
My empress...Anastasia...was like that...too...
[k]

＠Ivan the Terrible
She did not weep over life's hardships...[sr]Instead...she wept for others' misfortune...
[k]

＠Ivan the Terrible
It was that...excess...that I found to[sr]be...the most beautiful thing about her...
[k]

＠Ivan the Terrible
...Yes...I see now...[sr]That is why...this world...was defeated...
[k]

＠Ivan the Terrible
It is because...we lost everything...we[sr]should have cherished...above all else...
[k]

＠Ivan the Terrible
...Victory...is yours, [%1]...[sr]I accept...my defeat...
[k]

＠Ivan the Terrible
Even if you refuse to do so...I accept...my defeat...and so...I must...depart...
