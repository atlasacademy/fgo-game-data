I hear a voice from a long time ago...one of the “records” that remains in this shadow's head.
[k]

＠
A voice dripping with oppressive authority,[sr]intolerant of the slightest defiance.
[k]

＠
“I'm told you have some skill with a crossbow? Then go ahead and make this shot. If you succeed, I will overlook your transgressions...”
[k]

＠
A mess of emotions... Reluctance, doubt, fear... Each raged within me at those words, but still, I took the shot.
[k]

＠
I shot an apple off of my son's head,[sr]because I had no other choice.
[k]

＠
That was my profession, after all. I'd made a[sr]life out of only ever hitting what I aimed at.
[k]

＠
But I never thought of myself as the god of marksmanship. Besides, even gods are known to miss sometimes.
[k]

＠
And a hunter always has to consider what will happen if they miss their shot.
[k]

＠
Because the fact is, the moment their arrow misses, there will be another target that absolutely needs to be hit.
[k]

＠
So I had another arrow ready to go inside my jacket.
[k]

＠
If my first arrow failed to pierce the apple...
[k]

＠
If both my son's world and mine had ended with that shot...I would at least make sure the beast so needed killing would die with us.

Thankfully, I didn't need to use[sr]my second arrow on that day...

But even so, I had every confidence in the world.

＠
If my first arrow had missed...or rather, if the arrow that absolutely needed to hit its target didn't...
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_91 2.5 1.0]

＠
...the fact that there would then be[sr]another target that needed to be hit...
[k]

＠
...meant that my second arrow[sr]would be sure to find its mark.
