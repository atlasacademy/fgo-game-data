＠Brynhild
You fight well, sisters[line 2]better, even,[sr]than your specifications should allow.
[k]

＠Brynhild
But one of the things I gained in[sr]meeting Sigurd was a human heart.
[k]

[charaFace D 9]

＠Brynhild
It is something uncontrollable, something wholly different from our natural state. At times, the feelings it inspires can drive one to madness.
[k]

＠Brynhild
Drastic mood swings. Wavering.[sr]Faulty functionality. Excessive heat.

...Now that you three have been alive for so long,[sr]I see you all have human hearts as well.
[k]

＠Brynhild
You all have intense emotions, and your spearmanship reflects it. I'm so glad to see that.

Love. Hate. Joy. Grief.[sr]They all flicker like flames in the wind.

Sometimes they shrink to embers. But other times,[sr]they explode into all-consuming blazes.

But even the tiniest embers show that there is something lurking within your circuits[line 2]

First you preach at us, then you tell us we're not even Valkyries!

I knew it, you have gone mad! Your mixed feelings for Sigurd have tainted and twisted you!

Once you were our proud, unwavering, fearless sister... You gathered the souls of fallen heroes tirelessly... No more! Your affections have corrupted your mind!
