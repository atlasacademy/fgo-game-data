＠Meunière
There we go...
[k]

＠Meunière
It can't hurt to wear a snowsuit over your arctic Mystic Code. Not that it's likely to do much good when it's a freakin' hundred degrees below out there.
[k]

＠Meunière
Listen. I know what Goredolf said, but make[sr]sure you don't go taking any unnecessary risks.
[k]

＠Meunière
Just take it easy, and focus on[sr]staying alive first and foremost.
[k]

？1：Don't worry about that.

[charaFace E 1]

＠Meunière
Good.[sr]Glad to hear it.
[k]

？2：It'd be a helluva waste if I died now, after all.

[charaFace E 1]

＠Meunière
Right? There's all sorts of fun things out there just waiting for you to experience. I knew you had potential,[sr][%1].

Once this is all taken care of,[sr]you'll have to come check out my hometown sometime.

I, uh, I know that you really[sr]helped us out back at Chaldea...
[k]

＠Meunière
...but the fact is, you've got serious limits as a Demi-Servant. So if you encounter any hostiles, you just focus on keeping your distance.
[k]

All the more so if [%1]'s in a tight spot. Whatever it takes, you two better make it back here alive.

If you can manage to secure a leyline, you should be able to summon Servants again.

＠Meunière
You're the one who took care of all those Singularities.[sr]I don't have to tell you what an accomplishment that is.
[k]

＠Meunière
You've met at least one or two Servants who're crazy enough to answer a summon, no matter the circumstance.
[k]

＠Meunière
So as long as you can get the bare minimum of energy into that Spirit Origin graph, you oughta be able to summon at least one Servant.
[k]

＠Meunière
You probably won't be able to get a really strong one, though. Our magical energy supply here doesn't hold a candle to Chaldea's.
[k]

＠Meunière
But even so, any Heroic Spirit you can get to help you would be a godsend at this point. So do what you gotta to make that happen.
[k]

？1：...Got it.
？！

[charaFace E 3]

＠Meunière
Honestly, I have no idea what's coming.[sr]The Doctor is gone, and so's more than half our staff.

＠Meunière
I never thought things could get even worse than they were back in Orleans.

＠Meunière
But here we are, and just like back then,[sr]you're our only hope, [%1]. Good luck.

？1：You can count on me!

I know we can. Oh, and if it's not asking too much, try to find some fish. Do that, and I'll treat you to some of the best home cooking you've ever had.

Great, looks like we've got comms working. Not sure what kind of range we'll get in this storm, though.

Now then, the first order of business[sr]will be to look for a leyline.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Here's what I'm thinking:[sr]start by heading north, then turn east.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If you still haven't found a leyline[sr]after a while, then you can continue west.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Once that's done, come back to the Shadow Border before you check out the south.
