＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
Not good, I'm afraid.
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
They've always been treated very badly there,[sr]thanks to their connections to us.
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
We've done what we can to help each other out till now, but now things are getting worse.
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
On top of that, the Oprichniki have[sr]been even more violent lately.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
Rumor has it they even burned some other village to the ground after there was a revolt there.
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
The people there had no choice but[sr]to give up that place and move on.

Well, I can't blame them for that...[sr]That village only ever existed to serve as a decoy.

＠Atalante Alter
Still, leaving, hm... A bold decision. I would be surprised if thirty...even twenty percent of them survived the journey.

Maybe not, but twenty percent surviving is still better than all of them getting massacred by the Oprichniki.

Huh?

＠Patxi
Don't you feel the least bit guilty about these[sr]villagers giving up their lives for you guys?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
Aha, you're from one of those villages too, huh.[sr]Don't worry, so am I.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Patxi
Answer the damn question!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
...Sure we feel bad about it.[sr]But what are we supposed to do?
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
We're fighting a war against Ivan the Terrible here.
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
The immortal tsar who's been alive for[sr]the last four hundred and fifty years.
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
Who knows how many villages have been sacrificed over the years, or how many innocent Yaga, children included, have lost their lives.
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
But what other choice do we have?

I know we're all gonna go to hell for this. And once we get there, Viy's gonna look at us with those Mystic Eyes and see every awful thing we've ever done...
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
But before that happens, I want to defeat Ivan the Terrible once and for all, so that my kid can at least grow up in a world without him.
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
And now that the boss...Lady Atalante's joined us, this is the best chance we might ever have to make that happen.

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
We're gonna spark a revolution, right here in Russia!
