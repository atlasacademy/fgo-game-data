The battle in the castle is over. That would seem to be the last of the giants who were dwelling in the underground.

＠Meunière
So I guess this means the queen was forcing the giants to obey her all this time, rather than them having submitted willingly.
[k]

＠Meunière
But then, if she did have them under her control...
[k]

[charaFace F 3]

＠Meunière
...why did they go around attacking Mash and[sr][%1] the moment they laid eyes on them?

I assume those masks were only able to provide enough control for her to prevent them from attacking the villages.
[k]

＠Holmes
In which case, they would not stop the giants from homing in on any heat source that happened to wander into their field of view.

Haha, gotcha.[sr]So that's why the villages are safe to live in...
[k]

＠Meunière
And since you don't have to leave your village to survive here, I guess it all works out. Her Majesty thought this stuff through more than I thought.

＠Da Vinci
This world couldn't have lasted for three thousand years otherwise. Especially since it sounds like most of it had been burned to the ground.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Keeping each village's population to a hundred people must have been a restriction intended to ensure life could continue here.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Da Vinci
I mean, the queen even made those conifer trees out of ice with her magical energy. There just isn't that much food to go around.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You had to be strong to survive in Russia,[sr]but here, being strong is a death sentence.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The only way to survive in this world is to stay weak and live your life inside the confines of your village.
[k]

[charaFace B 24]

＠Da Vinci
But that is neither here nor there.[sr]Come on, everyone!
[k]

[charaFace B 12]

＠Da Vinci
We've gotta get ready to welcome back Mash,[sr][%1], the Heroic Spirits,[sr]and Her Majesty herself!

Where'd that idea come from!?[sr]Have you got nothing but free time or something!?

[charaFace E 5]

＠Goredolf
D-don't be ridiculous. If I come to be recognized as a great author once we have restored humanity, the Musiks could end up becoming Lords!
[k]

[charaFace E 6]

＠Goredolf
After all, it's the mark of an excellent leader to plan for what happens following the battle's end.
[k]

＠Meunière
Now you're throwing shade at Napoleon!? There's no way you could ascend to a Lordship without the clout to go head-to-head with Policies and the aristocracy!
[k]

＠Meunière
Now get your head out of the[sr]clouds and your ass in a chair!

I do beg your pardon, Mr. Meunière, but would you mind hurrying along with our travel preparations?

＠Holmes
Though they may appear to be moving slowly, the giants' footsteps cover an astonishing amount of ground.
