＠Yaga Chief
Maybe it's because he's grown old, or because someone's talked him into it...or because there's something strange going on in Russia right now...
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
...but all I know for sure is that the Tsar hasn't said one thing for the past three months, and the Oprichniki have cracked down on us harder than ever.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
The only reason this village has escaped their wrath is because we're located far away from the closest highway, and because of how poor we are.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
All that said, young ones, the Tsar is still the Tsar.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
We Yaga must never forget what he[sr]has done for Russia, and for us.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
If he hadn't come up with a way to combine us with Demonic Beasts, and turn us into Yaga...we would have died out long ago.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
It's only by his grace that we are alive at all.[sr]So we cannot lend our aid to the rebel army.

Let me finish.

...That said, the Oprichniki have been out of control.[sr]They are neither Yaga, nor the old humans.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
If the Tsar refuses to keep them in check,[sr]we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
So the question is,[sr]are you strong enough to take them on?
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
That is what I would like you to show me.

Oh, that's easy.

＠Yaga Chief
We have a number of strong Yaga here in our village,[sr]as well as some domesticated Demonic Beasts.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
What do you say to a battle against them?[sr]Not to the death, but anything else goes.
