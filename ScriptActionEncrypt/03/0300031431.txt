Then there's the enormous gap between the technology the emperor employs and the primitive way the farmers live their lives.

＠Holmes
They may enjoy the benefits of this Lostbelt's advanced medicine and biochemistry, but their machinery has not advanced beyond the medieval era.
[k]

＠Holmes
No doubt that is part and parcel of the emperor's attempts to maintain perpetual ignorance throughout the empire's citizenry.
[k]

＠Holmes
This is to say that while this Lostbelt may be highly technologically advanced, the sole beneficiary of those advancements is its ruler.

Precisely. Technology only sees widespread use once it is sufficiently compact and affordable.
[k]

＠Holmes
But in this Lostbelt, neither[sr]of those concerns are a factor.
[k]

＠Holmes
Qin Shi Huang's ability to monitor everything within the empire simultaneously is a remarkable feat...
[k]

＠Holmes
...but I cannot imagine a way to maintain it at that scale without massively inefficient labor costs.
[k]

＠Holmes
However, if Qin Shi Huang is the only one using such a system, any concerns about cost effectiveness would be moot.
[k]

＠Holmes
The idea for integrated circuits would never occur to the emperor, nor would there be any concern about cost when the entirety of the nation's resources exist for Qin Shi Huang's sole personal use.

＠Holmes
There certainly isn't any need for them to carry individual communicators, as they can converse with their emperor wherever they may be.
[k]

＠Holmes
For that matter, in this world, the very concept of long-range communication is the emperor's sole domain.
[k]

＠Holmes
There is no real need for private communication between individuals over a distance here, nor would it even be permitted.
