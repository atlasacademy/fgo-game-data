...and yet, Akuta has not told this Lostbelt's king[sr]of the tree's importance.

Correct. From our perspective, distributing a drug like this is no better than mass murder.

Still...a case can be made from a Buddhist perspective, and how it views the four inevitabilities of human life[line 2]namely, birth, aging, disease, and death.

If one considered both old age and illness equally undesirable, one could say this medicine protects you from the pain of the former and the latter at once.

Its resistance to disease, its yield...everything about it stands leagues above its natural counterpart in Proper Human History.

With a crop like this, one could live their[sr]entire life without ever knowing hunger.

There is no economy here; no division between rich and poor exists. And we have all seen for ourselves how ignorant they are of war and violence.

It seems that life here is as far removed from the suffering that one might expect in our world as it is possible to imagine.

And when their life has run its course, this drug puts them to sleep permanently, well before they can begin to feel the pain of old age.

That may not be directly related, but it does support my current hypothesis.
[k]

＠Holmes
Heroic Spirits have always been one side of Alaya[line 2]mankind's collective unconscious. They are defined foremost by their purpose: protecting humanity.
[k]

＠Holmes
While there may be many different methods and conditions involved in summoning Servants, the one thing they all have in common, without exception, is responding to the summoner's prayer.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]
＠Holmes
However...if there was not a single person in the world who had the emphatic need to pray for something...
