I can't tell. But that Nezha was a formidable fighter indeed. I sense that she is...optimized for this land.

If we had kept at it, one of us would have ended up resorting to releasing the full power of their Noble Phantasm.

Perhaps we should be grateful that this mountain where the god we are looking for resides still stands intact.

...and you just have to accept them.

[charaFace G 4]

＠Captain
I got to know Nezha pretty decently myself after I met her in the Wandering Sea.
[k]

＠Captain
It's true that I was interested in how her mechanical body was made with sage arts, but I also felt like we were similar somehow.
[k]

＠Captain
...So I know that Nezha was a great warrior,[sr]and an upstanding Servant.
[k]

＠Captain
I'm sure she was prepared for this, much more than she needed to be. She would never want you guys to be so sad about her that you stopped moving forward.

Agreed. Now is not the time for you to worry about this other Nezha. We'll handle that analysis on our end.
[k]

＠Holmes
Although, one thing I did notice[sr]in your battle just now...
[k]

＠Holmes
...was that she did not appear to be subject to this world's estrangement effect, as you are.
[k]

＠Holmes
So we may be able to learn more about that effect by focusing our efforts there.
