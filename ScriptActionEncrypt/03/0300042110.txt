＠Asclepius
...Well this is disappointing.[sr]My doctor's intuition is telling me quite clearly...
[k]

＠Asclepius
I may have succeeded at removing that cancerous Alter Ego from this world, but he was only a symptom. I wasn't able to eradicate the source.
[k]

＠Asclepius
Dammit. Even if I did only just wake up, that's no excuse for me to fail a simple operation.
[k]

＠Asclepius
It's still not enough. I need more techniques. More knowledge. No, not just me... If medical science is to advance, mankind will need more, too.
[k]

＠Asclepius
I don't have time to rest.[sr]I must return to my research... My training...

Well, it seems the other source of this world's infection[line 2]that giant tree[line 2]has been excised as well. If so, maybe that'll do...

No. No, it's not enough. There's nothing more dangerous than amateurish medical treatment.

＠Asclepius
No layperson should ever attempt an operation under anything but the most dire circumstances. The sooner foolish patients die, the sooner they can help medical science advance.

It doesn't matter who I am. If you're neither sick nor injured, and have no need for a doctor, then go away.

I'd offer to go away myself, but I'm afraid my own legs can't take another step.

Take this and have her swallow it. It'll put her to sleep, but that's normal. Don't worry about it.

＠Asclepius
Wait until morning, and if she's still coughing,[sr]give her this pill as well. That's all.

What is it that drives me to pursue it to the exclusion of everything else?

Still...there is one thing I know I want.

＠
Humans... Mankind... Carry on my work.[sr]Travel the path that others have blazed.
[k]

＠
There is no need to fear failure.
[k]

＠
Casting aside excellence may be foolish,[sr]but it is no less so to cast failure aside.
[k]

＠
For anything that continues to evolve will always be defective when compared to the future.
[k]

＠
If human medicine can reach the same heights I did, and continue on even further, they will no longer have anything to fear from the gods.
[k]

＠
I once managed to conquer death...[sr]Will mankind ever do the same?
[k]

＠
Yes. I'm sure they will.[sr]As long as no foolish gods try to get in their way.
[k]

[charaFace A 11]

＠
How I loathe such gods, none more so than Apollo,[sr]who impregnated a human woman, only to let her die.
[k]

＠
If human medicine can ever truly surpass death...
[k]

＠
If it advances to a point where they can bring back the dead, and no one ever has to die again...
