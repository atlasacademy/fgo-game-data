＠Scáthach-Skadi
...Why are we using this lump of metal for transport?
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
That seems terribly inefficient.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
The Heroic Spirits would reach our destination far more quickly with a flight rune, or a speed rune.
[k]

＠Fou
Fou? Fo fou?
[k]

＠Holmes
We determined this was the best course of action under the circumstances, Your Majesty.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Totally. The giants are waaay more aggressive now, AND we've got Tree of Emptiness seeds falling from the sky.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Flying would make us easy targets for the giants lobbing ice boulders, and fleeing on foot would open us up to getting picked off individually.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Here in the Border, it's much easier to attack and defend at once.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
For example, the emperor can use his cannon up on the deck to scatter any groups that come after us!
[k]

＠Meunière
Hm...?[sr]I just saw something new on the radar.
[k]

＠Goredolf
More enemies!?
[k]

＠Meunière
No, they're not hostile. But they are flying...[sr]Are those...birds?
[k]

＠Holmes
Can you put them up on the monitor?
[k]

＠Meunière
Of course. Here you go.

Ah, look...
[k]

Fou!
[k]

？1：Huh. Birds.
？2：Haven't seen these in a while.

？！

＠Mash
Yes. Two of them again, no less.
[k]

＠Mash
They must be native to the fields that crop[sr]up in between the fire and ice zones...
[k]

＠Sitonai
Huh. They must be good friends.[sr]...Wait. Let me get a better look at them. Hmm?
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
You two. You say you have seen these birds before?
[k]

＠Mash
Yes. Several times...
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
I see...
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
That explains it. Now it all makes sense.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Something on your mind, Your Majesty?
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Oh, just thinking aloud, young sage.

This is Napoleon, reporting in from atop the Border.[sr]I just saw some flying creatures besides those birds!

We've got another bunch of seeds headed our way![sr]How far away are these things coming from, anyway!?

I'll head out as well. I would like to familiarize myself with Gram's weight a bit more.

I'll go too.

No, you stay here. I can handle this alone,[sr]and I want you to rest up.

No, my love.[sr]Come what may, I will not leave your side.

...I see. Very well then, let us go together.
