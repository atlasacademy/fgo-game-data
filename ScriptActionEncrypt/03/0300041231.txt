＠Man
I don't know how we can thank you! As if curing our disease wasn't enough, you even tended our fields for us...
[k]

＠Man
Are you a new Lōkapāla!?[sr]You must be, to show us this much kindness!
[k]

＠Man
Please, stay with us.[sr]The whole town would be thrilled to have you!
[k]

＠???
...Tch.

＠Man
Hm?
[k]

＠???
...Sorry. My throat's been acting up a bit.[sr]Pay it no mind.
[k]

＠???
I just stopped by to check on things. This isn't the fundamental solution this Lost[line 2]this world needs.
[k]

＠???
It's the ones who will show up after me who are bound to end you.
[k]

＠???
They're from an organization called Chaldea, just as I am. Make sure to welcome them when they get here. It'll speed things up.
[k]

＠Man
Okay... But, it isn't, um, Chaldea we want to thank. It's you.

＠Man
Please, won't you stay with us for just a little while? We would be honored...delighted, even, to repay someone so virtuous.

＠???
(They really mean it. These people can't have much to spare, yet they still want to reward an outsider...)
[k]

＠???
(...Never mind that. Why do they like me at all?[sr]This sort of thing would never have happened before.)
[k]

＠???
(I'm not doing anything different than I was before. I'm still operating under the exact same principles I always have. So why am I seeing such a different reaction now...?)
[k]

＠???
(Is it only because of what I look like?[sr]Do people really care about appearances that much?)
[k]

＠???
(Oh well. If that's is true,[sr]it suits my needs perfectly.)
