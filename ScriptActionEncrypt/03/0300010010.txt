＠
...And so, our history came to an end.
[k]

＠
It's been ninety days since the invasion from space began. In that time, the entire planet has been wiped clean.
[k]

＠
We've been fighting back for three months.[sr]Three long, arduous months.
[k]

＠
Every single attempt ended in failure.[sr]Of course they did.
[k]

＠
We had all kinds of security measures in place to deal with other countries...but we were completely unprepared for an invasion from outer space.
[k]

＠
The United States fought hard to the last man,[sr]but even so, they only lasted a matter of days.
[k]

＠
With no other options left to them, all the few remaining humans could do was stand by and stare around, dumbfounded, at the endless stretch of nothingness.
[k]

＠
Everyone resigned themselves to the fact that each passing day could well and truly be their last.
[k]

＠
...But not me.[sr]I just couldn't let it end like this.
[k]

＠
So I turned my back on the campsite and walked away like a petulant child, casting a deaf ear to the people offering up their final prayers.

＠
Before me, I saw a vast wasteland of endless white.[sr]Any trace of humanity had been erased.
[k]

＠
We no longer had any hope for survival, let alone of turning the tide. Nothing we tried had even the slightest effect.
[k]

＠
In this wasteland, I searched through old records[sr]like a raccoon pawing through garbage.
[k]

＠
I managed to find an old motorcycle, with barely enough fuel for a one-way trip, and began riding across the blinding white wasteland.
[k]

＠
It's just...nothing about this makes sense. There are so many unanswered questions. If I'm going to die, I at least want to know why.
[k]

＠
I can accept an alien invasion.[sr]I can even accept the end of the world.
[k]

＠
But I can't accept not knowing[sr]WHY they invaded us, or HOW.
[k]

＠
The invasion lasted a good ninety days. There must have been SOME sign leading up to it. Someone must have seen this coming.
[k]

＠
Or, maybe...someone knew this was coming,[sr]and decided to LET it happen.
[k]

＠
How did the invaders first make[sr]their way to Earth to begin with?
[k]

＠
Someone needs to figure at least that much out,[sr]or humanity will never be able to rest in peace.
[k]

＠
So I'll keep exploring until I find a lead[line 2]some sort of clue that could lead me to the answers I seek.
[k]

＠
This recording might just be me talking to myself...but still, there's every chance that this is the last document remaining on Earth.
[k]

＠
My name is David. David Bluebook.
[k]

＠
I'm an oddball setting off on the last trip of his life, searching for answers in a world where I'll be lucky to see tomorrow.
[k]

Researcher's Log, 2018
[k]

＠
Eighteen hours have passed since the events we observed in New Mexico. At last, Subject E has been relocated to this base.
[k]

＠
Honestly, I can barely contain my excitement. This is the biggest thing to happen since the Roswell UFO incident in 1947.
[k]

＠
I have no idea how it ended up making an emergency[sr]landing on this planet, and I don't care.
[k]

＠
What I do know is that our...visitor is at death's[sr]door and needs our help if it's going to survive.
[k]

＠
I also know that it is an intelligent life-form,[sr]and is nothing like us humans.
[k]

＠
Its form beggars belief. Thank goodness for the boundless capacity of the human imagination.
[k]

＠
This visitor from a distant world looks exactly like the sort of thing one would see in a horror movie.

＠
My orders are to perform surgery on this new friend from beyond the stars to save its life and hopefully establish communication.
[k]

＠
I'm literally trembling with excitement.[sr]My entire staff and I are eager to begin our work.
[k]

＠
This will be a difficult operation, but we WILL save it. This will be, by far, the most fulfilling work I've ever done. How could I not see that it succeeds?
[k]

＠
...My only regret is that I won't be able to share these discoveries with the outside world.
[k]

＠
This project is as classified as they come, and who knows if it will ever be disclosed to the public.
[k]

＠
Until then, we must continue to nurse it back to health in secret, here in this underground facility.
[k]

＠
It is here that I must study this strange new[sr]life-form. These...tree roots come to life.
