Pitiful.[sr]Everyone we meet here is so weak I can hardly stand it.

But then, these aren't people, are they?[sr]They seem to be mechanical puppets. How awful.

＠Chen Gong
At this rate, I don't know when we'll[sr]ever get to form a contract with a Master.

That said, anyone capable of ordering us around should be able to take a good kick from you without even losing their smile.

Well, hello there.[sr]It's good to finally meet another Servant.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]
＠Chen Gong
One who appears to be accompanied by a mage with Command Spells, no less. I must say, I'm rather jealous.
[k]

＠Chen Gong
It would seem you have a Master with whom you have formed an official contract.

No, we do not. If that Master of yours happens to be looking for new Servants, then it would seem this is a most fortuitous encounter indeed.

？1：I'd definitely like some new Servants.

？！

Oh yes, we'd be happy to, as long as you all survive.

We still have obligations to our lord from when we were alive, you see, so we make it a point to only swear loyalty to those who are truly strong.

The Flying General has a reputation to uphold, after all. We retainers must stay true to ourselves, no matter how many times our souls may transmigrate.

＠Chen Gong
But, if you mean to serve as our general[line 2]if we are to trust you with our lives[line 2]then we must be certain you are too strong for us to kill.

And so, we will try to do so now.
