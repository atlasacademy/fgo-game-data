...I experienced the Kali Yuga ending several times after Aśvatthāman was taken from me.
[k]

＠
I felt the light of creation wrapping me in a tight embrace, just as powerless to do anything as the people absorbed in their worthless prayers.
[k]

＠
As long as the god of this world doesn't consider you defective, at least there's no pain. You don't feel it.
[k]

＠
The light just keeps getting brighter, blinding you and even numbing you to the passage of time.
[k]

＠
The next thing you know, you're right back where you started, only everything around you's been changed...
[k]

＠
I don't know what the locals make of that experience...
[k]

＠
...but it was awful enough to almost make me vomit.
[k]

＠
I'd rather stick my head inside a festering dead body, or kiss a pile of excrement from a prison cell without plumbing.
[k]

＠
Those options might be revolting, but least I wouldn't have to be so frightened.
[k]

＠
So while I hate to admit it, when that light finally subsided, and I found myself standing there...
[k]

＠
...I would be relieved that[sr]I had avoided being taken away.
[k]

＠
But it was never long after that my relief turned to worry, to the point that I could barely think straight. Maybe I just got lucky this time. What about the next time? Or the time after that?
[k]

＠
So in retrospect, it was inevitable that I would take action like this sooner or later.
[k]

＠
This time, I managed to avoid the light by escaping to the Reverse Side of the World, so I thought I might feel differently now...but surprisingly, nothing changed.
[k]

＠
Upon laying eyes on the new world of this cycle, I felt the same things as always: loathing, and discomfort.
[k]

＠
To use more contemporary slang...I just can't even with this world.
[k]

＠
I guess its god bothers me even more than I expected.
