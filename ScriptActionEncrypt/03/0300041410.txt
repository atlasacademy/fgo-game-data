Not bad. Many of them are in good shape thanks to farming and hunting.

＠Rama
I doubt I can train them each to kill kali alone,[sr]but I am sure I can teach them to survive in battle!

All right, it's time for lunch![sr]Just make sure none of you have too much to eat!

It looks like the town has been split cleanly in half.

＠Peperoncino
There are more people who support fighting back against the kali now, but not everyone has joined in.

＠Peperoncino
On the one side, we have the people from Dival,[sr]along with the people they inspired to join them...

...and on the other, there are the people who are still holding on to their old beliefs...

Our ultimate goal is to reduce Arjuna's power by getting people to realize how imperfect and unnecessary of a god he is.

＠Peperoncino
So I certainly hope a bunch more decide to join us,[sr]or we'll be in big trouble.

＠Peperoncino
We should be hoping to win over the rest of this town, then keep that momentum to win over other people here.
