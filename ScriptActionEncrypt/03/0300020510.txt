Shutting down high-speed mode, now.[sr]Good work hanging on, everyone.

＠Mash
Our current estimated location is atop what used to be Lake Vänern...the lake northwest of Lake Vättern.

＠Mash
Which means this village almost certainly[sr]didn't exist in Proper Human History.

？1：This village is a lot bigger than I expected.

＠Mash
Same here. From the outside, it looked like a fairly wide area surrounded by large wooden walls.
[k]

＠Mash
Although, there are surprisingly few houses.[sr]I would guess there can't be more than fifty.
[k]

？2：What's this village called?

＠Mash
Come to think of it, you never did tell[sr]us your village's name, did you, Gerda?
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
The part that stands out the most to me is the large gate that makes up what looks to be the only entrance. I don't know much about architectural design, but this place does seem to have its own unique style...
[k]

＠Mash
I also sense powerful magical energy here. The whole village is surrounded by a Bounded Field centered on that large gate.
[k]

＠Mash
It's designed to keep away giants, beasts, and other beings related to magecraft. I can feel it weighing down on me too, though only a little.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
Although, I didn't notice it[sr]at all until I was inside...
[k]

[messageOff]
[wt 1.0]
[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
I'm guessing it's the snow...
[k]

＠Mash
The magical energy mixed in with the snow and ice, and the magical energy that makes up this village's Bounded Field, are extremely similar.
[k]

＠Mash
It's a very static, sedate kind of energy...as if its presence were the most natural thing in the world.
[k]

＠Mash
It's calm, gentle, and very stable in[sr]the amount of magical energy it holds.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
Maybe “kind” is a little too vague,[sr]but I'm not quite sure how else to put it...
[k]

？1：So like, magecraft designed to enrich people's lives...?

[charaFace A 6]
[wt 0.7]
[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Yes, that's a much clearer way to put it, Senpai!
[k]

？2：I think “kind” works.

[charaFace A 13]

＠Mash
Yes. I first noticed it in the snow plains, but it feels like there's nothing malicious in this Lostbelt at all.
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
All that aside, this village is really spacious...
[k]

＠Mash
Maybe that's because there are so few houses,[sr]and a large plot of farmland in the center?
[k]

＠Mash
I can see they grow all sorts of crops here.[sr]There's wheat, numerous fruit trees...
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
It's just like Gerda said.[sr]It's as warm here as it was in that flower garden.
[k]

＠Mash
This explains how people could survive even in a Lostbelt predominantly made up of snow, ice, and fire.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
Although, there's still one thing I don't understand. If Bounded Fields are so crucial to ensuring people's way of life here, who put them up?

[k]

＠Gerda
The envoy put them there for us. They keep out all the giants, the ice beasts...really anything scary.
[k]

＠Gerda
I'm surprised you two didn't know that, since you're envoys! Is that just the way it works, Lady Mash?
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
Oh, uh, well...
[k]

＠Mash
I think you may have the wrong idea about us.[sr]I don't believe we're what you call envoys.

Although, if “envoys” is the term you use for visitors,[sr]then I suppose we might qualify...

＠Sigurd
I know I'm supposed to protect you and kill your enemies, Ophelia. But is that necessary here?
[k]

＠Sigurd
Yes, humans have demonstrated incredible power before. At times, they've rebelled against gods, tricked giants, and even killed dragons.
[k]

＠Sigurd
But not here.
[k]

＠Sigurd
The humans here aren't people anymore.[sr]They're livestock. None of them are any threat to you.
[k]

＠Sigurd
These humans used to be just like the ones in Proper Human History: weak, transient beings whose only purpose was to be our prey.

＠Ophelia
...This world belongs to a goddess.
[k]

＠Ophelia
Even if there are less than ten thousand humans here,[sr]it is still a pure land ruled by a goddess of old.
[k]

[charaFace F 11]

＠Ophelia
Lord Kirschtaria even said it could end[sr]up the last Lostbelt left standing...
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Ophelia
The fact that a goddess rules it also means[sr]it's the perfect place to experiment.
[k]

＠Ophelia
That's why this Lostbelt has so much potential.[sr]In fact, it is far more than the sum of its parts.
[k]

＠Sigurd
Oh?
[k]

[charaFace F 8]

＠Ophelia
...In terms of potential, at any rate.
[k]

＠Ophelia
If we can grow our tree to maturity, we might be able to breathe new life into humanity and nature alike.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Ophelia
I don't care how much contempt you have for humanity as a result of your origins and temperament.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Ophelia
All I care about is that you don't let your guard down.[sr]Again: you're my shield and my sword. Don't forget that.
[k]

＠Ophelia
You and I share the same responsibility:

We must grow this Lostbelt's Tree of Emptiness[sr]to full maturity. That is your sole concern.
[k]

＠Sigurd
Hmph.
[k]

＠Sigurd
I've never been much of a gardener, but if you insist, Ophelia, I guess I've got no choice.
