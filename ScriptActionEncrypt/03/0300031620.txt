That medicine you handed over is not the only[sr]means of neutralizing the poison, is it?
[k]

[charaFace E 17]

＠Koyanskaya
Oh? And on what are you basing that oh-so-hopeful assertion, might I ask?
[k]

＠Holmes
That you chose to come to this particular[sr]Lostbelt in the first place.

You made sure to wait until the time was ripe before you went about poisoning [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1].

Were your poison truly incurable, you would only need to flee once the deed was done..
[k]

＠Holmes
As long as you had managed to cover your tracks,[sr]you could escape without leaving a trace.
[k]

＠Holmes
And yet, by the time we had arrived in this Lostbelt, you were already here.
[k]

＠Holmes
Now why would you do something so foolish?

The answer is simple: because there is something in this Lostbelt you needed to keep away from us.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Holmes
And what else could that be but[sr]a way to cure the poison you used?
[k]

[charaFace E 25]

＠Koyanskaya
Ugh. I can't stand men who have nothing more to offer than their minds.

I imagine you must have heard that from[sr]Irene Adler a lot too, didn't you?

I'll thank you not to draw comparisons between her and an agent of pure evil such as yourself.

Now then, as we can be sure that Ms. Koyanskaya's purpose in coming here was to protect it, we must simply ask ourselves what this cure might be.
[k]

＠Holmes
It would have to be something already lost in Proper Human History...
[k]

＠Holmes
...as well as something unattainable in any other Lostbelt. Which leaves...

Quite so. Though there are many things unique to this Lostbelt, the Fusang Tree is the only thing I can think of that would be impossible to obtain elsewhere.
[k]

＠Holmes
As the key to the sage world's Mystics, we know that it has no end of biochemical applications, as Qin Shi Huang has so aptly demonstrated.
[k]

＠Holmes
I see no other magecraft system that could possibly be used to refine such a strange and complex poison.

[charaTalk E]

＠Koyanskaya
Well, I suppose there's no point in playing dumb any longer. Yes, you're right. That poison was derived from the Fusang Tree.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
The substance made by distilling its roots with yin energy is called Xiān Shuāi Míng Mài, or “Immortal Decline”...
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
...and the one made by decocting its leaves with yang energy is called Xiān Huó Mìng Mài, or “Immortal Lifeline.”
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Either way, whether you're making poison or antidote, you need something from the Fusang Tree.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Koyanskaya
Of course, you could always make an antidote without the Fusang Tree as long as you could extract something with the same components...
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
...but we all know Proper Human History lost those kinds of Mystics long ago, don't we?
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Which means the antidote I had[sr]on me was your one and only hope.
[k]

[charaFace E 18]

＠Koyanskaya
Given that I held [%1]'s life in my hands...
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
...I did consider making [&him:her] my slave[sr]and forcing [&him:her] to do my bidding...
[k]

[charaFace E 25]

＠Koyanskaya
...but I couldn't get Akuta's report out of my head.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
If only I had never heard her[sr]mention there was a Lostbelt...
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
...where the Fusang Tree remained[sr]alive and in human custody.

I prefer to think of it as[sr]knowing when to hedge my bets.
[k]

＠Holmes
Whatever you choose to call it, your instincts helped us out considerably for once.

＠Holmes
Once we obtain the Fusang Tree for ourselves,[sr]we can cure [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1]'s poison, correct?

Theoretically, yes.
