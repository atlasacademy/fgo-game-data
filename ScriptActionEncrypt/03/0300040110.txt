On December 31, 2019, the entirety of human history was erased in a single stroke.
[k]

＠
Every trace of civilization was wiped out, and in its place, the earth was left a bleached wasteland.
[k]

＠
No one knew why or how it was done. All that was clear is that humanity had been utterly defeated.
[k]

＠
No... It's worse than that.[sr]We never even had a chance to fight back.
[k]

＠
Our destroyer was known as the Foreign God, a being from a distant star wielding unfathomable power.

This planet will soon be reborn[sr]as an old, brand-new world.

Human civilization was a mistake.[sr]The path of our growth was incorrect.

And so I have made my decision. I will revolt against all of human history[line 2]Proper Human History.

＠Kirschtaria
We are about to fill this world with inhuman Mystic secrets. We will restore the Age of Gods.
[k]

＠Kirschtaria
To that end, the gods have descended from a far-off galaxy, and in their wisdom, they have used seven seeds to select new leaders.

＠Kirschtaria
These leaders will remake this planet as they see fit. And the one who reign supreme shall be given the right to renew the world itself.

The life-forms from Proper Human History will not be permitted to take part in this war, or even to view it from the sidelines.

Chosen by the Foreign God, the seven Crypters were entrusted with caring for the Trees of Emptiness...
[k]

＠
...the enormous trees that appeared around the world after its scouring.
[k]

＠
Each Tree of Emptiness was followed by a Lostbelt; a hypothetical history that had been pruned from the chronicle of humanity.
[k]

＠
There was the Russian Lostbelt, where humans had fused with beasts in order to survive in an ultracold environment.
[k]

＠
There was the Scandinavian Lostbelt, where a Ragnarök gone awry had robbed the world of any possible future.
[k]

＠
And there was the Chinese Lostbelt, where a single ruler who achieved immortality carried the rest of mankind on their shoulders.
[k]

＠
These and other Lostbelts were to grow their territory, with the one emerging triumphant becoming Earth's official history.
[k]

＠
As far as the Crypters were concerned, their only enemy[line 2]or rather, competition, was the other Crypters competing to establish their Lostbelt's dominance.
[k]

＠
The few remnants of the old humanity[line 2]Chaldea, were no more than a tiny bump in their road.

...that it's just not possible to make the Border seaworthy while preserving its existing functionality.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Just because it can sail in Void Space doesn't mean it can do the same in Reality Space. Each ocean requires a completely different means of traversal.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And since the Border is an All-Terrain Void-Transporter, we can't allocate that many resources only to make it capable of sailing on real water.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I guess we could technically do it if we made the hull bigger, but if we did that, we wouldn't have nearly enough staff to run it.

Whoops, scratch that! I should know better than to get overly serious before you have even headed out on a mission!
[k]

＠A：Sion
I am sure we will run into more than enough trouble in the Lostbelts, so we should at least try to enjoy ourselves while we are in the base!
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠A：Sion
All right, that is all for now. Please make sure to review the particulars of this mission on your mobile devices.
[k]

＠A：Sion
This Order will commence at dawn.
[k]

＠A：Sion
Be sure to get plenty of sleep, and come to the dock by the time we agreed on.
[k]

？1：Got it!
？2：Roger that!

We have less than six hours until the mission starts. You should head back to your room and get some rest.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I doubt we'll have many chances to get a full night's sleep once we're in the Lostbelt. Who knows when you'll get another chance to stay in a bed that doesn't rock?
[k]

？1：Uh, you might want to check your watch...

I have. Been behind you. For some time. You must. Have been. So focused. On Da Vinci. That you didn't notice.
[k]

[charaFace J 5]

＠Nezha
In any case. This is. A good chance. To tell. You this. You can't. Let Da Vinci. Push herself. Too much.
[k]

＠Nezha
She is. Doing everything. Leonardo. Da Vinci would.[sr]Be doing. But while. In a much. Smaller body.
[k]

＠Nezha
That obviously. Puts tremendous strain.[sr]On her now. You must. Be aware. Of that.
[k]

[charaFace J 0]

＠Nezha
She may. Have inherited. Leonardo. Da Vinci's. Duties.
[k]

＠Nezha
But she. Is a. Pseudo-Servant. Just like. Mash is.
[k]

[charaFace J 4]

＠Nezha
We may. Differ in format. But she and. I are.[sr]Very similar. I understand. How she. Is feeling.
[k]

＠Nezha
No. Scratch that. I do. Not know.[sr]How she. Is feeling. Da Vinci is. So strong.

I said too much. My apologies. So please.[sr]Keep this. Between us. Promise?

I am. Coming along. To the Indian Lostbelt.[sr]I hope. We can. Continue. To get along.
[k]

...The Indian. Lostbelt is. A very. Bad place. Every part. Of my. Spirit Origin. Is warning. Me not. To go.

[charaFace J 5]

＠Nezha
Even so. Every Lostbelt. Is dangerous. I am. The Crown. Prince Nezha. I must. Not back down. From a challenge.

If things. Go bad. I know. You will. Help me![sr]I'm sure. I have. Nothing to. Worry about!

＠A：Sion
Your destination is the Indian Lostbelt. Your objective is to help Captain gain experience poi[line 2]
[k]

＠A：Sion
I mean, power up the Shadow Border, explore the Indian Lostbelt, and ultimately eliminate it.
[k]

＠A：Sion
Captain and I will handle the Shadow Border side of things, so please do not concern yourselves with that.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠A：Sion
What I would like you to focus on, Master [%1], is cutting down the Indian Tree of Emptiness.
[k]

＠A：Sion
I estimate you should have room in the Border to fit about twenty days worth of supplies.
[k]

＠A：Sion
While the Aronnax Phantasm will be loaded into the hangar as supplemental equipment...
[k]

＠A：Sion
...you will not need to account for it in battle,[sr]as it is not meant for offensive purposes.

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 4]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠A：Sion
Correct. From here, you will need to travel across Void Space to get close to the Indian Lostbelt...
[k]

＠A：Sion
...and from there, you will need to immediately undergo another Zero Sail in order to make your way inside...
[k]

＠A：Sion
Consecutive Zero Sails are draining, even for Servants, and Da Vinci's protection safeguards can only do so much.
[k]

＠A：Sion
So I think it is best if we keep no more than three Servants on standby in the Border.

Then, no matter how many Servants we win over to our side in the future, we'll only be able to take three of them into a Lostbelt with us?

[charaTalk A]
[charaFace A 12]
[charaFadein A 0.1 1]

＠A：Sion
That is how it works out, yes. I am not saying we can never send more than three if we really have to, but the Servants summoned inside a Lostbelt are more powerful anyway.
[k]

＠A：Sion
So when you get there, I would like you to secure a leyline and use Mash's holy relic to form contracts with new Heroic Spirits, just as you have in the other Lostbelts.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠A：Sion
All right then...as the Wandering Sea Command Room's supervisor, I have an order for those of you on the field team.
[k]

＠A：Sion
As of this moment, Novum Chaldea will be transitioning to its first battle position.
[k]

＠A：Sion
Field team, go ahead and board the Border,[sr]starting with Master [%1].
[k]

＠A：Sion
Once I have confirmed all of your vitals are green,[sr]you will begin a Zero Sail...
[k]

＠A：Sion
...and officially commence Order Lostbelt No. 4 along with its Sub-Order, Horned Monster.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠A：Sion
Make sure you all give it everything you have,[sr]and I look forward to your safe return!
