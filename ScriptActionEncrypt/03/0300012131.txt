[k]

＠Avicebron
With the Minotaur gone, there is no one left to claim ownership of the labyrinth.
[k]

＠Avicebron
Now that the magical energy required to maintain this miraculous relic from the Age of Gods is gone, we should soon be able to escape.
[k]

＠Avicebron
However...if we act now,[sr]we can use this labyrinth for our own means.

I do. It is a relic from the Age of Gods,[sr]and so would make the perfect body for a golem.
[k]

＠Avicebron
The only question to be answered is,[sr]what do we do about its core?
[k]

That's right.
[k]

＠Avicebron
I have been worrying about what to use for[sr]my next golem's core for quite some time.
[k]

＠Avicebron
The ones I have been using in combat so far are mere replicas, designed for the briefest of use.
[k]

＠Avicebron
These replicas do require a vast amount of magical energy, but that is all they require.
[k]

＠Avicebron
Unfortunately, they alone won't be[sr]enough to defeat Ivan the Terrible.
[k]

＠Avicebron
I got a glimpse of him before the rest of you.[sr]Kadoc Zemlupus showed him to me.
[k]

＠Avicebron
...That thing is utterly inhuman. He is a primal being, the kind that must have existed on this planet long before humans ever did.
[k]

＠Avicebron
It would be impossible to slay a monster[sr]like that with such impermanent forces.
[k]

＠Avicebron
So then, what can we do?[sr]How should we fight such a fearsome opponent?
[k]

＠Avicebron
...If we cannot find an equally[sr]powerful entity for the core, then...

I certainly am.[sr]Especially now that I finally understand your goal.

If you can provide me with materials like that,[sr]then the only other thing we will require is a core.
