Well, the last version of me [bgm BGM_EVENT_79 0.1 0.8]wasn't too involved with[sr]Team A, so I can't speak from experience...

＠Da Vinci
I wouldn't be shocked to hear she had similar strategies for everyone.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
My guess is that she was trying to cultivate a very specific image for herself among Team A.

Namely to leave the faintest impression among them,[sr]to seem neither too hostile nor too friendly.

It was back when we were all taking a break in the[sr]rec room, [bgm BGM_EVENT_70 0.1]some time after Team A had been formed.

Kadoc was nursing a drink[sr]while Beryl cheered him on...

Kirschtaria and Daybit were[sr]arguing about mythology...

Peperoncino was teasing Ophelia[sr]with some sort of joke.

As usual, Akuta was off reading by herself,[sr]refusing to participate in any of the conversations.

I'm certain that whenever I looked directly at her,[sr]she always had her nose in her book.
[k]

＠
I'm sure anyone else who had[sr]been there would agree with me.

But...
[k]

＠
...when I happened to catch a glimpse of Akuta's reflection in a glass I was polishing...
[k]

＠
...I realized that wasn't the case at all.
[k]

＠
She was actually just hiding her face behind the book, and was in fact keeping a close watch on each of us.
[k]

＠
...She was so guarded. Almost as though she was terrified of something.
[k]

＠
But by the time I'd turned around to look at her,[sr]she had her nose back in her book.

She went right back to pretending to read the second she sensed my eyes on her.
