You say that Chaldea didn't defeat Ophelia, but rather that she sacrificed her life of her own accord.

You also say that in order to stop Surtr, the Fiery King of Giants, the one hiding in the Scandinavian Lostbelt, before he could trigger Ragnarök...

...she used her Sirius Light, and acted[sr]not as a Crypter, but simply as Ophelia.

I see. Looks like I'll be the only one bringing flowers to her figurative grave then.

But that's okay. Flowers are the one thing my Lostbelt has plenty of. It might not line up with her beliefs, but I can still hold my own little funeral for her.

I'll be sure to add some flowers for you too, Kirschtaria, since I've not seen you so much as smile since you sat in that chair.
