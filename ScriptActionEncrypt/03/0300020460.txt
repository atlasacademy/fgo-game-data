That's right. The Tree of Emptiness is like a huge tree that stretches all the way up to the sky. Have you ever heard of anything like that?

As for the sun, we were hoping you might know something about why it's so big here...

I've never heard any legends about a big tree like that,[sr]and the sun's always been that size.

It's just like mountains always being made of fire or ice. That's just how it's always been! Nobody asks why!

(In Norse mythology, the world tree[line 2][bgm BGM_EVENT_79 0.1 0.7][sr]Yggdrasil played a very important role.)

(I know she's young, but it seems a little strange that Gerda wouldn't know ANYTHING about it...)
[k]

？1：Yeah, you're right. It does.

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
(Right.)
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

(Maybe it's because we're relatively high up near the fire that the ice and snow have melted here...)
