I can't believe it... These are the same soldiers we fought before! How can they be this much stronger just from a change in commander!?

Yeah, I hear you. Been a long time since I was up against a general who could make your blood run cold.

(That said...I think this man's strategical sensibilities may even outpace Zhuge Liang's...)

＠Han Xin
Oh, hello, Captain. Are you sure a hard-ass like you wants to get mixed up in a wild brawl like this?
[k]

＠Captain of the Guard
The emperor asked me to keep an[sr]eye on you until this was all over.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Han Xin
...
[k]

＠Han Xin
Ahh, we really don't deserve such a wonderful emperor. I can hardly believe the emperor would care so much for a piece of trash like me.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

＠Captain of the Guard
You said it.
[k]

＠Captain of the Guard
The emperor even told me I was free to fight all I wished, as a reward for my years of faithful service.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Han Xin
Hehehe. I see not even old age can slow you down.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_80 2.0]

＠Han Xin
Well then, let's get to it, shall we? At this point, I can't think of any better way to demonstrate our loyalty to the emperor than by going down fighting.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

＠Captain of the Guard
Heavenly Emperor has been kind enough to keep broken men like ourselves in check by allowing us to serve.

You'd better not hold back against him!
