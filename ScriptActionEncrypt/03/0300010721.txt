There they go.[sr]It would seem there is no need to follow them.

...Right. If anything, it looked[sr]more like they were running away.

Some of them even broke away during the fight...

I am sure there are any number of reasons why they may have done so, but for the moment, perhaps our time might be better spent making haste to our goal?

＠Holmes
It took some time to register the Yaga biosignals,[sr]but I've managed by using Patxi's as a base.
[k]

＠Holmes
That said, at this point all I can do is use this data to determine if any Yaga are in the direction you're headed.
[k]

＠Holmes
For example, at this moment, I can tell you that there are several hundred Yaga along your current path.
[k]

＠Holmes
I rather doubt they are all bandits, so it would seem that there is still an opportunity to stop those who are.
