I dream of an impossibly tragic war...

It's like I told you in my report.[sr]Yama's power wasn't helpful at all.

Come to think of it, it's probably because he's similar to Hades. I may have spent my time hating him without realizing it.

So I need you to lend me another Divinity.[sr]Yama alone isn't going to cut it.
