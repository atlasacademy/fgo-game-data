After that, I want you to sort them into perishables and nonperishables, and give the perishables to the children and elderly!

If it weren't for you and Avicebron,[sr]the rebel army would have been wiped out today.

...Or, barring that, we may have ended up massacring those townspeople...and we could never have hoped to atone for such a sin.

[charaFace C 0]

＠Atalante Alter
Thankfully, our own losses were minimal. At least, that is what I will tell myself to keep despair at bay.
[k]


＠Atalante Alter
At any rate, I am sorry to ask this of you so soon after getting back, but...I have another mission.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
We learned something in our intelligence gathering for this operation. It did not pertain to the operation, but it is nonetheless very important.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
It concerns the town of Yaga Tula...
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Atalante Alter
Do you remember what I told you before, about the soldiers who came to join us and soon ended up leaving again?
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
I'm told that they made their way into Yaga Tula, ingratiated themselves with the local authorities, and now essentially run the town as their own.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
Although they've been careful not to do anything that would incur Ivan the Terrible's wrath...
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Atalante Alter
...unfortunately, it would seem the imperial court's mage, priest, or some such caught wind of those Yaga.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
We have word that the Oprichniki and a Servant have been sent to deal with them, which has thrown the whole town into chaos.
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Atalante Alter
...But this also puts one of our enemy's stronger operatives alone and unguarded in the field, not counting the Oprichniki, of course.
[k]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Atalante Alter
This represents an excellent opportunity to eliminate the Servant. Unfortunately, Yaga Tula is too far away to send a large force without it being obvious.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Atalante Alter
I am certain one of Avicebron's golems[sr]could cross that distance in no time...
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
...but if he goes with you, I'm afraid that[sr]would leave the golems here inoperable.

Yes, I heard the report.[sr]...That sort of thing happens all the time.

Though it may have been a poor choice on his part to run away in Yaga Smolensk, of all places.

But, [&he's:she's] human, right?[sr]Aren't humans weak?
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Yaga (Child)
I heard that's why they all died out a long time ago,[sr]so I'm real surprised to see some now!
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
Don't be stupid![sr]These humans are here BECAUSE they're strong.
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
So strong, they'll kill you if you[sr]keep mouthing off to them like that!
[k]

＠Yaga (Child)
Okay. Sorry!
[k]

？1：Don't worry, we're not going to kill you.

＠Yaga (Child)
Yay! Thank you!
[k]

？2：Why did you say we would kill her?

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
For us, the idea that the strong get to eat is absolutely everything. It affects every aspect of our lives.
[k]

＠Yaga Rebel Soldier
I've had that idea imprinted on me ever since I was a pup myself, and I still basically agree with it.
[k]

？！

＠Yaga (Child)
See you later![sr]Bring me back a souvenir!
[k]

？1：I don't know if there'll be any souvenirs, but I'll try...

I've finished making adjustments to your golem, Master. Thankfully, the blizzard is rather mild today, at least by this world's standards.
[k]

＠Avicebron
I believe it would be best to take advantage of that and make as much progress as you can.

Please make sure you're well prepared before you head out, Master. Don't forget to check your arctic Mystic Code!

Indeed. This cold is so severe that any slit in your Mystic Code could quickly lead to frostbite and necrosis on the affected body part.
[k]


＠Avicebron
Even with your magecraft protection,[sr]I do hope you will be careful out there, Master.
[k]

？1：All right, I'm heading out!

And now, thanks to the Master of Chaldea, that goal actually seems attainable, rather than a pipe dream.

Hmm. So you are a survivor from the rebel army. Unfortunately, you were the only one I was able to capture.

The Oprichniki have a terrible time exercising[sr]control at times like this, you see.

I see. So you lack confidence in your memory, eh?[sr]I appreciate you telling me that before we begin.
[k]

＠Priest
Your kind are quite durable indeed. We could be out here all day if we take things one question at a time.
[k]

＠Patxi
What was that...?
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠Priest
I said you Yaga have a high tolerance for pain, thanks to your dull sense of it. All the more so if you're prepared to give up your lives.
[k]

＠Priest
In my experience, you cannot make a Yaga talk whether you rip out his claws, break his limbs, or even toss him in a dark hole for a month.
[k]

＠Priest
The Oprichniki's methods of torture only ever end up killing you. It's a tremendous waste of time.
[k]

＠Patxi
Is that so?[sr]If you're gonna kill me, then kill me already!
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Priest
I can't do that, my young Yaga. As you can see,[sr]I am a man of the cloth, here to spread God's word.
[k]

＠Priest
I would like to avoid taking life unless strictly necessary. Besides...I have something else in mind.
[k]

＠Priest
There's a test of sorts I've been meaning to try out. Oprichniki, we will be taking this Yaga with us. Do be careful with him.
