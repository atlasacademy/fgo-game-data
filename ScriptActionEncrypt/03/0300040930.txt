...At the time, revolts were breaking out all across India, under all manner of different circumstances.

＠Captain
When one small state tried to revolt, the neighboring nations would often end up siding with the British...

...isolating the rebels and cutting them off from working with like-minded people in other regions.

But the Jhansi rebels managed[sr]to hold out till the very end.

And it was all thanks to their[sr]exceptional leader, Lakshmi Bai.

The goddess Lakshmi exists within me more as a power source than anything else. I can barely sense her consciousness at all.

It's almost as though her heart has been implanted in me to provide me with energy.

＠Lakshmi
I doubt my output can measure up to that of an unadulterated Divine Spirit.

So I'm afraid I am not a manifestation of the goddess Lakshmi so much as my core is that of the human, Rani Lakshmi Bai, with small elements of the goddess.
