Ordinarily, it would not have fallen so easily. In fact, it should have been impossible to destroy without the help of a particular external factor.

At least, that was the queen's understanding.

And yet...here it was, falling apart.[sr]Vanishing into the very air.

Perhaps it had grown brittle by virtue[sr]of Surtr having assimilated it.

The cacophony of a towering colossus crumbling to the ground... The shaking at the loss of the very foundations of the world...

The animals who lived in the rifts between[sr]fire and ice...the giants who still remained...

A newly ordained day.[sr]A newly ordained time.
[k]

＠
After the envoy had delivered the Goddess's newest commandment, quiet spread throughout the settlement.
[k]

＠
Nobody was to go outside. Everyone was to stay in their homes and beds. They were told not to even open their windows.
[k]

＠
Make your bedrooms as dark as possible,[sr]close your eyes, and go to sleep.
[k]

＠
It was the strangest commandment anyone had ever heard.
[k]

＠
But most people went along with it, since it was the word of the Goddess. In fact, here in Village 23...
[k]

＠
...there was only one person not sleeping peacefully inside her home.
[k]

＠
She wondered what might happen to[sr]her for not obeying the commandment.
[k]

＠
Would she be cast outside the village?[sr]Squished by giants? She certainly didn't want that.
[k]

＠
Still...she couldn't help it.

She wasn't able to fall asleep, and she couldn't shake the strange and growing sense of foreboding from her thoughts.

Anyway, last we checked, the Wandering Sea should be somewhere in the North Sea, far from the coast. So let's just enjoy this road trip until[line 2]

J-j-just to be sure, the Border can navigate a real sea just as well as it can the Void Sea, right!?

You did design it for every conceivable scenario, didn't you? A stormy sea should be nothing compared to Void Space, right?

The Border might be able to get through the Strait of Dover, but it was not designed to weather this!

Now, I've got an announcement of my own: I estimate the Border has about an hour until it sinks!

So back the hell up and get us back on land![sr]NOW, Meunière! Come on, hurry!

Once we reach the coast, we can waterproof the Border better and wait until this storm dies down!
