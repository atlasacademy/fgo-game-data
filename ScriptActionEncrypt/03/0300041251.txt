Dammit. Can a doctor really accept his death at the hands of a violent patient? No. Definitely not.

It would be a lot of trouble to explain what just happened to them. I say we leave now.

Let's just leave before the locals start throwing stones at us for assaulting an agent of god or something.

Well, not FINE fine. I'm just as exhausted and hurt as everyone else is.
[k]

＠Mash
I was just...thinking about something else.
[k]

[charaFace H 12]

＠Mash
Now that we've faced Arjuna directly, it's clear just how overwhelmingly powerful he is.
[k]

＠Mash
And not just as a lone fighter.
[k]

＠Mash
I could tell he was on a completely different scale...almost like he was competing with the ground itself to see who was stronger.

[charaFace H 7]

＠Mash
Oh, but please don't misunderstand me, Master![sr]I'm not about to give up by any means!
[k]

[charaFace H 0]

＠Mash
I'm just saying, analytically speaking, that Arjuna is undoubtedly the most powerful god in this world.
[k]

[charaFace H 8]

＠Mash
And...the more I think about how we could hold our own against him, the more I come up blank...
[k]

[charaFace H 7]

＠Mash
Even if we succeed at defeating the Lōkapāla and reducing his power, would it really make any difference...?
