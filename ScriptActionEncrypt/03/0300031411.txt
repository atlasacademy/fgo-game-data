I never thought humans would be able to keep the sage arts working for over two thousand years, but I was clearly wrong.

This Lostbelt's king is a tough negotiator. The other Lostbelt kings might be monsters that no human can control...

But really, do you even have any[sr]proof that that was my mistake?

Chaldea takes pleasure in disturbing my people's way[sr]of life. They would never kill them just for sport.

But you, on the other hand, take pleasure in nothing so much as messily devouring humans.

Thus, we hardly need conduct a thorough investigation to determine your guilt.

It is true that we do not. While we are quite adept at parallel processing, our greatest concern is indeed Chaldea.
