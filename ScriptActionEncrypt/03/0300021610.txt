I... I can't fail Lord Kirschtaria.
[k]

＠
He trusted me with this.[sr]I can't let him down.
[k]

＠
This time...I will not fail to live up to his wishes.
[k]

＠
I refuse to disappoint him.[sr]So I won't. No matter what it takes.

And so...

＠
...even if today is Sunday, I'll endure it.[sr]I know I can.

I don't care if I even smell my own[sr]flesh beginning to burn and char.

“There. I have connected myself to the Tree of Emptiness [image berserker_language_1].”

He was right; something was different. Surtr changed from a being of pure fire, to one of fire and ice.
[k]

＠
When I asked him how the Fiery King of Giants could possibly hold Authority over ice...
[k]

＠
...he told me he had long ago swallowed it.
[k]

＠
...First the beast of Ragnarök consumed the true sun, removing it from Scandinavia's reality...and then the giant of Ragnarök ate the beast?
[k]

＠
That's absurd.[sr]It's not even remotely realistic.
[k]

＠
But...in this Lostbelt, that is the reality.
[k]

＠
The giant of ice and fire smiles.[sr]He's pleased to have regained the power he lost.
[k]

＠
I can see wings growing from his back.[sr]Looking past the various possibilities, I see...
[k]


＠Ophelia
(...invisible dragon wings...)
[k]

＠Ophelia
(Does this mean...he's starting to manifest Fafnir?)
[k]


＠
Once he gains perfect form, he will no doubt complete his transformation into a winged ice and fire giant.
[k]

＠
A hybrid of giant and dragon.[sr]I could see that making some sense.
[k]

＠
And then, there was the flaming sword. As the embodiment of several kinds of raging Authority...
[k]

＠
...he once slaughtered the gods and his kin alike.
[k]

“Now...”
[k]

As he spoke his words of flame, countless masses began to writhe around at his feet.
[k]

＠
They reminded me of children grasping for their mother...of maggots searching for light.
[k]

＠
They were seeds. A vast number of seeds.
[k]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_79 1.0]

＠
Yes. As if things weren't bad enough...
[k]

＠
...he absorbed the Tree of Emptiness,[sr]right before my eyes.
[k]

＠
He severed the tree's connection to Scáthach-Skadi.[bgm BGM_EVENT_81 0.1][sr]Slowly, he sank his teeth into it, and then, in an instant...
[k]

＠
...he slurped it all down, root and stem.
[k]

＠
Using the Tree of Emptiness's power, he forced a Spirit Origin Ascension upon himself and took back his past Authority.
[k]

＠
...It should have been impossible, yet somehow, he managed it. Was it the Paper Moon, and its ability to let one interact with Void Space?
[k]

＠
Is that how he was able to pile impossibility atop impossibility, and consume the Tree of Emptiness?
[k]

＠
It should not be possible,[sr]and yet there it is, plain as day.
[k]

＠
I tried giving orders, but to no avail. The tree simply shed my control, and the queen's, of its own accord.
[k]


＠Ophelia
You connected yourself to the Tree of Emptiness...[sr]No, you can't even call this a connection anymore.
[k]

＠Ophelia
You preyed upon it.
[k]


[se ade69]
＠
“Hehe.”
[k]

＠
“It welcomed me.”
[k]

＠
“Though I am sure the tree lacks a will of its own...”
[k]

＠
“...what it did possess was the same[sr]heat that lies in all life.”
[k]

＠
“Yes, there was a fire deep in the heart of the Tree of Emptiness [image berserker_language_1] as well.”

“It told me it did not want to be cut down.”
[k]

＠
“That it wanted to live.”
[k]

＠
“That it would not die.”
[k]

＠
“That it would not forgive.”
[k]

＠
“...Or so it kept screaming.”
[k]

＠
“Hehehehe.”

“Life is nothing if not greedy.”
