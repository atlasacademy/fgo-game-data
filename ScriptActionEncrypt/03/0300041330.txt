I... Goddess within me, what do you think?

＠Lakshmi
I know you won't answer me.[sr]But I also know that you're listening.

That's why I asked you back[sr]then what it was I should do.

＠Lakshmi
I know what I'm doing, and I've made my peace with it.

＠Lakshmi
But, even so, now that things have come to this,[sr]I can't help but wonder...
[k]

＠Lakshmi
The village is in ruins, lives have been lost, and people are grieving. Who can say this isn't the result of getting caught in that inescapable current?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

Is what I...what we're doing here...

...truly worth deceiving the Chaldeans[line 2]
