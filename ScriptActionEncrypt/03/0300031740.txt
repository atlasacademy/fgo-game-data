I think I was able to patch them up for now...but even putting their wear and tear aside, their batteries just aren't gonna last much longer.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I never planned on having to charge them outside the Shadow Border, you know.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I think our only option here is to try and jury-rig an energy saving mode to make them last longer.

＠Holmes
I see. Well, I have no doubt any modifications you can make will be of great utility. They've already held up remarkably well, given their improvised nature.
[k]

＠Holmes
At any rate, it won't be long now before we reach Xianyang, and any advantage the devices may confer over long-range surveillance will be lost.
[k]

＠Holmes
However, even if we are no longer able to mask our location, we should now be close enough to the capital that we need not fear an orbital strike.
[k]

＠Holmes
Once we have rested up tonight, I believe we should make for Xianyang with all haste.

[charaFace D 4]
＠Jing Ke
I can't stop thinking about the fact that[sr]I finally have another chance to face that emperor...
[k]

＠Jing Ke
I came this close to assassinating him when[sr]I was alive, but I wasn't quite able to pull it off.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
And now, with Xianyang almost staring us in the face, I feel that failure more keenly than ever. I just can't get it out of my mind.

If I take on a different mission now, I'll be so preoccupied with this that I might end up making a fatal mistake.

[charaFace D 4]

Man...you really don't let up, do you?[sr]You're not even going to let me get a poem in.

Look, I can't promise everything will be fine.[sr]Not when I'm going up against Qin Shi Huang.
[k]

[charaFace D 1]
＠Jing Ke
But...I can promise I'll make it to the Epang Palace. Especially now that you've made sure I won't forget that look you're giving me.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
So make sure you find the Fusang Tree,[sr]and take care of that poison.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
After that, it'll be time for our real battle,[sr]with the Crypter...Yu Mei-ren.
[k]

＠Jing Ke
So let's both keep that in mind[sr]as we go our separate ways, okay?
