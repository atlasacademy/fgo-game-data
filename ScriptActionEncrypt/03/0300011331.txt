...Is that so? You sure are pushing your luck, aren't you, human? Almost like looking at myself back when I was still living.

＠Caenis
Fine, Kadoc, I'll see how far that arrogance of yours carries you. You're right, Russia IS your game board, after all.
[k]

＠Caenis
You just do your best to get first place.[sr]But be careful you don't get taken by surprise.
[k]

＠Caenis
If you pull it off, maybe then I'll join you for your little tea party.

...What an obnoxious Servant.

＠Grand Duchess
If you hadn't been here to stop me,[sr]I would have ended up killing Caenis myself.

We don't need any more trouble right now.[sr]And we don't want to bother the Tsar either.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
I wonder if all heroes from the[sr]Age of Gods are as rude as she is.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
...I can't stand how she looks down on us, either.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Kadoc
Yeah, yeah. I know, it's all my fault.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
Yes, it is. And when something reflects poorly[sr]on you, it reflects poorly on me as well.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
I understand why that is,[sr]but it only makes me angrier.

＠Kadoc
...I still have some tea leaves Pepe gave me.
[k]

＠Kadoc
I know you Servants don't need that sort of thing,[sr]but I hope it'll at least put you in a better mood.
[k]

[charaFace A 1]
＠Grand Duchess
...That will depend on how it tastes.

＠Kadoc
Sheesh...
