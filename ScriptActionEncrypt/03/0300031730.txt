Well, we are getting close to the capital.[sr]It is difficult to mask our intentions at this point.

＠Holmes
No doubt all the troops that were out patrolling other areas will be called back to help defend Xianyang.[sr]This will not be an easy fight.

Agreed. I could not begin to guess what might be going through her head...
[k]

...but she appeared to me as though she were hesitant to make use of her powers as a True Ancestor...

Or, to take a different perspective,[sr]she may have refrained from attacking us...
[k]

...because she knows she could use her True Ancestor powers to wipe us out at her leisure.

An eminently plausible theory, given how[sr]confident we know True Ancestors to be.

＠Holmes
In which case it is unlikely Yu Mei-ren would interfere with us again before the final stage of this battle.
[k]

＠Holmes
She is determined to not be seen fighting, but she is also dead set on ensuring this Lostbelt's survival.
[k]

＠Holmes
It therefore is extremely likely that she will sit back and allow Qin Shi Huang's army to try to eliminate us for the time being, and only step in as a final line of defense once we have reached the Tree of Emptiness.

Sounds about right.[sr]Lucky for us that Akuta...Yu Mei-ren isn't a warmonger.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That aside, we're still no closer to tracking down this Lostbelt's Tree of Emptiness.
