In Greek mythology, Asclepius masters the art of medicine...and ultimately ends up creating a tonic that can bring the dead back to life.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
As you can imagine, the gods didn't take too kindly to that.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Particularly Hades, the god of the underworld, who was especially displeased at the idea of humans overcoming death and making a joke out of his Authority.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But since Hades couldn't harm Asclepius himself on account of him being Apollo's kid and all, he asked Zeus to punish him instead.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Zeus agreed, and killed Asclepius with a thunderbolt through the heart...

But the Greek gods were too narrow-minded, lazy, cowardly, and arrogant to accept that.

＠Asclepius
They were wrong, and they punished me for all the wrong reasons.

＠Asclepius
They punished me for nothing more than achieving excellence.

All you have to do is listen. If your doctor says not to do something, don't do it. If they say to do something, do it.

Why is that so hard for you to understand!? Don't you want to get better!?

Yama wields authority over the dead. Well, technically, it may be authority over this land's memory of the dead, but there is no meaningful difference.
