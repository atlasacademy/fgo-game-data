We defeated the giants and ice creatures...but that was the first time we've come across a mountain giant.

＠Mash
...A Bergrisi...
[k]

＠Mash
In Norse mythology, the Bergrisar were a race of mountain giants that were on friendly terms with the jötunn, the frost giants.
[k]

＠Mash
But, I don't remember reading anything about them banding together and attacking humans like that...
[k]

？1：First things first: great job out there, Mash.

[charaFace C 13]

＠Mash
Thank you, Master.
[k]

？2：How's the Ortinax doing? Everything okay?

[charaFace C 13]

＠Mash
Yes, everything's fine. Not to worry!
[k]

？！

＠Mash
I managed to fend off the attackers without sustaining any injury, all thanks to your support, Senpai.
[k]

＠Mash
The load on the Ortinax is well within its tolerance.[sr]...Da Vinci did an amazing job tuning it up.

(Is she speaking Swedish? The talisman doesn't have any problem translating conversation, but it's still a little hard to make out what she's saying.)

I can't believe it! The Goddess must have sent you!

＠Girl
Thank you, thank you, thank you![sr]You two saved my life. That's so amazing!
[k]

＠Girl
How did you do it!? Usually, anyone the[sr]giants see ends up getting pancaked...
[k]

＠Girl
...but none of us are even a little bit squished![wt 0.6][charaFace B 2][sr]Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

[charaFace B 6]

...Ahem. You're supposed to introduce yourself when you first meet someone, aren't you. I remember learning that.

Hello, Gerda. That's a lovely name you have.[sr]It has a wonderful Nordic ring to it.

[charaFace B 5]

＠Gerda
Thanks! Hehe, I like the way it sounds too.
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Gerda
It's very nice to meet you both, Ms. Black Armor, [&Mr. Black Hair:Ms. Red Hair].
[k]

＠Gerda
What are YOUR names?
[k]

？1：I'm [%1].

＠Mash
And I'm Mash Kyrielight.

＠Gerda
[%1] and Mash Kyrielight, huh. Got it!

＠Mash
Thank you, Master.[sr]And this nice [&boy:girl] is [%1].

[&He's:She's] my senpai.

＠Gerda
What village are you from? You don't seem like you're shivering... How can you not be cold with so few layers?
[k]

[charaFace B 1]

＠Gerda
I'm nice and warm, thanks to my fur coat. I knew I'd have to be ready for anything once I decided to go out on my own.
[k]

[charaFace B 2]

＠Gerda
The grown-ups won't help 'cause they're busy getting everything ready for tomorrow, so I have to do it all myself.
[k]

＠Gerda
That includes the cooking, and tending to the children who have come down with terrible fevers!

[charaFace B 2]

＠Gerda
Oh, umm...I don't have anything on me right now.[sr]I'd have to go back to the village...
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Gerda
B-but I also have to find the[sr]medicinal herbs before I go back...

...Hmmm. What should I do...

＠Mash
(Senpai, Senpai. This is the first Scandinavian we've met! This must mean there are human villages here.)
[k]

＠Mash
(And they don't seem to have mutated to adapt to this environment, like the Yaga had. Maybe that means their culture is closer to Proper Human History.)
[k]

[charaFace C 12]

＠Mash
(Although...for some reason...)

＠Mash
(...her outfit doesn't seem like anything[sr]someone would wear in 2020...)

[charaFace C 0]

＠Mash
(Regardless, I think she'll be willing to take us to her village. Once we get there, we can ask around...)
[k]

？1：...Right.

[charaFace C 12]

＠Mash
...Senpai?
[k]


[charaFace C 4]

[charaFace C 6]

＠Mash
Ah!
[k]

[charaFace C 12]

＠Mash
...Yes.
[k]

[charaFace C 4]

＠Mash
Once it's gone, all life in this Lostbelt will most likely...well...
[k]

＠Mash
But, if we're going to restore[sr]Proper Human History...

？2：I couldn't just let a little girl die...

？！

[charaFace C 7]

＠Mash
...Yes. I feel the same way.
[k]

＠Mash
I think I would have fought off those giants[sr]even if you hadn't said anything, Senpai.
[k]

[charaFace C 8]

＠Mash
...[sr]...
[k]

[charaFace C 0]

＠Mash
No...there's no way you would have just stood by, Senpai. That's just not who you are.
[k]

[charaFace C 13]

＠Mash
You would always be the first to try and rescue her.
[k]
