You need ask!? We are the emperor.[sr]We care first and foremost about humanity's future.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
We must...grudgingly admit that our empire was indeed pruned away from history.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
However, we cannot ignore that Proper Human History was so weak as to be so easily wiped out, even as you advanced the Chronicle Theoretical Phenomenon!
[k]

[backEffectStop bit_talk_haboob_01]

＠Qin Shi Huang
History is woven together through human will;[sr]its course is no mere coincidence.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
Thus, the one who leads the Chronicle Theoretical Phenomenon must be the stronger, superior human!
