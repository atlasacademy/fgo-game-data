＠Koyanskaya
It's useless. A Servant from Proper Human History[sr]has no chance against one from the Lostbelt.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
She's survived hardships and environments you[sr]can't even imagine. You never stood a chance.

[charaFace C 16]

＠Koyanskaya
Though I will say you did pretty well,[sr]at least for Servants from this cushy world.

Yes, I can see she has quite the formidable Spirit Origin! And you know what they say: the bigger they are, the more common their weakness!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Here, I'll show you what I mean![sr]Thanks for being so incorrigibly smug!

An anti-spiritual body flashbang...

＠Koyanskaya
She's a clever inventor, that Servant.[sr]But I'm betting she's just about run out of tricks.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Let's go after them, Your Imperial Highness. There's nowhere left for them to run. They're trapped like rats.

＠A：???
Rats, rats, rats...[sr]There were a lot of rats in that house, too.
[k]

＠A：???
All they know how to do is gnaw at their surroundings and multiply...and multiply...
[k]

＠A：???
Still, I recognize that that is one of[sr]Proper Human History's greatest strengths.
[k]

＠A：???
If their strength lies in multiplying, we will show our strength in eradicating them all the more fiercely.
[k]

＠A：???
Our world, the Lostbelt we come from,[sr]is a cruel and frigid place.
[k]

＠A：???
How laughable to think they consider this mild environment cold. Soon, we will show them what true hell is.
