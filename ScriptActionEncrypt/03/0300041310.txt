...Honestly, I don't think the name on your birth certificate matters that much.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
What really matters is what people think of you and what THEY call you.

[charaFace D 9]

＠Peperoncino
That says so much more about who you really are than a name in some database ever could.

[charaFace D 1]

Just look at all the famous historical figures who aren't known by the names they were given at birth!

You even had some in Chaldea, like Billy the Kid and Blackbeard, right? So there's no reason I can't[line 2]

All you need to know is that after I left Japan for the West and started really enjoying my life, one thing led to another, and I ended up getting to know some people at the Clock Tower.

Eventually, Marisbury invited me to Chaldea, saying my combat experience was just what he needed to make up for the academic bent of all the other mages...

The reason Arjuna is a god here isn't just because he collected every Divinity in this land for himself.
