That's right. Companions. To put it another way...a god is only a god if there are people who recognize them as such.
[k]

＠Karna
A god cannot be a god if they are all alone.
[k]

＠Karna
You grew dependent on power from beyond this world in the Tree of Emptiness, and wholly abandoned its people.
[k]

＠Karna
You may have become a nigh omnipotent god thanks to that power, able to create and destroy entirely by yourself...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Karna
...but such a god is no god at all.

＠Arjuna
I only sought perfection, greedily, to my own detriment... To the point I no longer realized I was doing so.

[charaFace B 4]

You are right, Karna...[sr]It was the dark, greedy Krishna inside me...

[k]

＠Arjuna
No matter how many yuga cycles passed, my obsession with you...my evil...would always remain.
[k]

＠Arjuna
It was that obsession that drove me to become a perfect god beyond what was necessary.
[k]

＠Arjuna
So the god I became[line 2]the final god, born of evil, who tried to guide his people toward a proper world...
[k]

＠Arjuna
...still harbored a dreadful evil within his soul.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

I probably should have tried to destroy that first, before I turned my focus to the world...

[charaFace A 5]

＠Karna
The Arjuna I truly aim to defeat is an ordinary man. He was never given the role of a god, final or otherwise.
[k]

＠Karna
But incomplete as he was, he never stopped seeking completion. I think that is who you were meant to be.
[k]

＠Karna
The world is no different. Once it is truly “complete,” there is nowhere left for it to go.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Karna
And having nowhere left to go...strikes me as woefully incomplete.

Ha... So it's a paradox. I believed I was complete, all while failing to notice the ways in which I was not.
[k]

＠Arjuna
What's more, believing myself complete was itself the seed of further deficiency.
[k]

＠Arjuna
Now I see. I was a walking paradox,[sr]right from the beginning.

＠Arjuna
I couldn't even be the man...[sr]you wanted me to be...
