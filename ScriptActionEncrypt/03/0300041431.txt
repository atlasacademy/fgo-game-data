Nezha intentionally chose to overload her Spirit Origin, but you've done a decent job of it without even trying.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Not only are you bearing the brunt of two Divinities in a single Servant body...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...but one of them is boosting your already perfect healing abilities well beyond their limits.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
You've obviously been pushing yourself waaay too hard.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
And since you don't have some special background that lets you handle that kind of load, like Arjuna does...this was only ever going to end with you destroying yourself.

Hey. Before I go, just tell me one thing.[sr]Do I seem that strange to you?

All I want is to advance medicine for the good of all mankind. Women, children, the elderly... Everyone should be able to benefit from getting the treatment they need.

All I want is a world where you won't be an outcast just for excelling. Excellence shouldn't be a crime.
