That's right. It was a highly unusual case,[sr]but I do have a contract with him.

What about your Command Spells?

I've already used all three. Still...I think it should be possible to forcibly break the contract.

That would be a great help. If you could do that, it would render him just another Servant without a Master.

Am I correct that he does not possess any special abilities, such as Independent Manifestation or Independent Action?
