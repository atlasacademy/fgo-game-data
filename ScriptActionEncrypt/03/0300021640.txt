...Sorry about this, Private.

The thing about trump cards is,[sr]they take everything you've got and then some.
[k]

＠Napoleon
Under the right conditions,[sr]you can pull off something incredible...
[k]

＠Napoleon
...but since it comes at the cost of your Spirit Origin and Spirit Core, you can't do it twice.
[k]

＠Napoleon
This is just one more possibility in action.

Keep moving.

That's right. Move. One foot in front of the other. It's okay to hesitate. It's okay to be afraid. But don't stop.
[k]

＠Napoleon
Right, left, forward, hell, even backward.[sr]Keep going wherever your mind takes you.
[k]

＠Napoleon
But don't ever stop. Don't ever retreat.[sr]Don't ever go back.
[k]

＠Napoleon
Keep moving as long as you still draw breath.[sr]Wherever the living go, that's where humanity goes.
[k]

＠Napoleon
You're never completely out of possibilities.[sr]There's always something you can do.
[k]

＠Napoleon
You destroyed the bands of light that threatened to incinerate the whole world, right? No reason we can't stop a sword threatening to do the same to this one.
[k]

＠Napoleon
That's who we are. That's our history. Making something happen when all seems lost is what it is to be human!
[k]

＠Napoleon
...That said, being human also means you will[sr]see a great many atrocities along the way.
[k]

＠Napoleon
Seeing all that crap, and still smiling like a damn fool, is the best part about being a foot soldier...
