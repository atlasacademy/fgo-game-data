How do you like my little cannon here!? C'est magnifique, non? Haha! Nothing better than a fine gentleman like myself fighting off a swarm of angels!

Well, I guess these aren't angels, huh?[sr]No wings.

[charaFace A 10]

＠Good Fellow
No, wait, scratch that. Didn't angels originally have wings because of some old winged Egyptian god or something like that?

[charaFace A 6]

＠Good Fellow
Ah well. At this point,[sr]I guess it doesn't matter either way!

Though they were just mass-produced models, this one can blast away several at once. I also see he is working with the individual known as Mash Kyrielight.

Servants are beings that threaten the Goddess's rule.[sr]Thus, they are to be eradicated, not loved.

Nah, it's not that. They're born 'cause[sr]the people want them to be born.

Go ahead and lead the way, kids from Proper Human History![sr]My cannon's yours to command!

This is what they call lending a helping hand! Let your magical energy loose! Don't hold back! Let's get this done with style!
