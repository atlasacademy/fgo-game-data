＠Qin Liangyu
Tell me, those of you who claim to be from Proper Human History: Why do you threaten our world?
[k]

？1：...Because this history should never have happened.
？2：...It's what we must do to save our own world.

？！

[charaFace E 5]

＠Qin Liangyu
So you want to set the world right...?[sr]Hmph. That's all you Confucians ever say.
[k]

＠Qin Liangyu
How should the world be then?[sr]What is this “proper” world of yours like?
[k]

＠Qin Liangyu
How does your world function when everyone has their own idea of how things should be, while denying all others?
[k]

＠Qin Liangyu
How many people lose their lives to the ravages of war each and every day?

My husband, my brothers...all of them gave their lives while fighting to make that dream a reality.

We[line 2]the people of this empire[line 2]had to build this world on their corpses!

The peace this land now enjoys was paid for with the blood of soldiers who will never be granted respite in[sr]Mt. Li.

[charaFace E 5]

＠Qin Liangyu
And so I will defend it at all costs. I will not let your flowery words and false promises lead me astray.

I believe in our way of life, in the happiness we fought so hard to obtain!

I don't need any other countries.[sr]I don't need any other version of myself.
