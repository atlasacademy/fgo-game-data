(No, wait. There is no reason to assume there is[sr]no Holy Grail here. That would be nonsensical.)

[charaFace D 5]

＠Holmes
(The very fact that there are Servants without a Master proves that there must be a Holy Grail here, or something equivalent to one.)
[k]

＠Holmes
(If a Holy Grail does not fall into human hands, it acts as a neutral source of magical energy, one that simply reacts to the world it finds itself in.)
[k]

＠Holmes
(In which case, it would be perfectly sensible for it to respond to humanity's death throes by summoning Servants to counter the source of that trouble...)
