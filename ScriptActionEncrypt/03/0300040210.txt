...but there is almost certainly another enemy we will need to face here.
[k]

＠Holmes
Given what we have seen thus far, there is an excellent chance that there is a Crypter assigned to this Lostbelt, and a king who has been ruling it since prior to the Crypter's arrival.
[k]

＠Holmes
It is therefore in our best interests to gather as much information as we can before we prepare to face them.

Right. India has historically been close with China, where they called it Tianzhu. I'm sure you're familiar with it.

Thank you, Nezha. I'm very reassured knowing you'll be there to help us!

...[sr]Nonetheless, Nezha alone simply won't be enough.
[k]

＠Goredolf
Da Vinci needs to remain here on standby, so that she can operate the Border at a moment's notice if necessary.
[k]

＠Goredolf
And Holmes needs to stay so that he can make full use of the Border's instruments while he analyzes our findings.
[k]

[charaFace E 10]

＠Goredolf
Suffice to say, [%1], that you will need to[sr]bolster your fighting force if you are to carry out your investigation.
[k]

＠Goredolf
To do so, you will have to try summoning new Servants in the field.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]

＠Goredolf
It's a shame the Atlas Institute Servant wasn't more accommodating, but there's nothing we can do about that!

＠Da Vinci
I agree you'll need to start by summoning new Servants, but as they say, every cloud has a silver lining.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And this particular summoning has two of them.
[k]

[charaFace F 7]

＠Da Vinci
First off, electricity. Thanks to Sion, we have another disposable booster you can use, like you did in China.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She said it's called a Void Cell. I gotta say, the Atlas Institute comes up with some really interesting stuff sometimes.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
As a refresher, just hook it up to Mash's shield and it'll provide all the resources you need for the summon.
[k]

[charaFace F 16]

＠Da Vinci
Unfortunately, thanks to all the time it took to make everything, it's only got enough juice for two Servants...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...but hey, it's still waaay better than flying a kite in a storm, right?
[k]

[charaFace F 8]

＠Da Vinci
Second, I already found a perfect leyline for summoning! Aaand it's well within walking distance.

Oh, you know, I just figured you'd want to say “Hold it! I'm the director, and I give the orders around here!” or something like that.

Oh.
[k]

＠Goredolf
...Well, I will admit I did come up with a few authoritative directives ahead of time...
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Goredolf
...but I ultimately decided they weren't necessary, given how this Lostbelt seems fairly peaceful.
[k]

＠Goredolf
And if there is no point in saying them, well,[sr]why waste my breath? It's only good sense.
[k]

[charaFace F 8]

Of course there's a point to them. They're very important! Go on, Gordy, hurry up and say something!

O-oh? Well, if you insist, and if it's not too late... Ahem.

You are to investigate this Lostbelt spreading across Indian land, and to find a means of felling that Tree of Emptiness as soon as possible!
