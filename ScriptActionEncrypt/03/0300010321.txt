These are my golems. I'm too weak to fight myself,[sr]so my only option is to have them do so on my behalf.
[k]

＠Avicebron
Now, Master, we can talk more later.[sr]First, I'm going to make this cave into my workshop.
[k]

＠Avicebron
That should strengthen our ability to summon, which will in turn allow you to make use of your Spirit Origin graph.
[k]

＠Avicebron
That way, you may call upon the shadows of the Servants registered within that briefcase whenever you like.
[k]

＠Avicebron
You will, of course, only be able to do so in combat,[sr]as this power is sadly quite limited in its scope.
[k]

＠Avicebron
Now then...I think I shall rest[sr]until the workshop is complete.

Allow me to introduce myself again.[sr]My True Name is Avicebron.

＠Avicebron
As you can see, I am a Caster.[sr]Just a humble maker of golems.

But, given the circumstances, it would nonetheless[sr]seem that I am just the Servant for the job.

But that can wait. For now, I'm just glad we have a new ally! And one who seems likely to be very helpful at that!

Hmm.[sr]...We'll first need to find the right materials.
[k]

＠Avicebron
I should be able to craft a suitable armor plate as long as we have quality ore imbued with magical energy.
[k]

＠Avicebron
Ordinarily, such ore is only traded among mages...
[k]

＠Avicebron
...but I believe we should be able to find some here.

＠Holmes
Right... In brief, I believe our next move[sr]should be to rendezvous with this rebel army.
[k]

＠Holmes
We now know that its leader is a Servant.
[k]

＠Holmes
Moreover, there is a strong chance they will elect to join us, given that they oppose Ivan the Terrible.
[k]

？1：But, we don't know where the rebel army is...
？！

[charaFace C 6]

I believe Patxi can be of assistance there.

[k]

＠Goredolf
Very well then, be off with you, [%1]. I await good news and a much overdue supply of food.
[k]

[charaFace E 10]

＠Goredolf
The Shadow Border's reserves are nearly empty, and the state of one's belly has a direct effect on morale.
[k]

＠Goredolf
I'm sure you are well aware of this, but the Border's staff are mentally exhausted as well.
[k]

＠Goredolf
They have been battling hunger, the cold, and cabin fever for some time now. At least YOU'VE been able to walk around outside.

＠Goredolf
The Musik family has been practicing alchemy for generations. Even if the meat DOES contain toxins, rest assured that I can make it edible!
[k]

＠Goredolf
I've been stranded and alone in snowy mountains countless times before, so I've invented my own spells to turn bad meat good!

I can even transform spoiled meat into sirloin![sr]Why else do you think I'm known as Musik the Phoenix!?
