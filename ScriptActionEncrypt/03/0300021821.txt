＠Scáthach-Skadi
Well done...[bgm BGM_EVENT_78 0.1]
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
To think I would lose so...decisively...
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
I could not even protect Ortlinde...
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Ahh. I knew it.[sr]I was far too weak to serve as queen.
[k]

＠Holmes
...I don't understand.
[k]

＠Holmes
Why didn't you tell us you had barely recovered any magical energy after our battle with Surtr?
[k]

＠Holmes
Why did you fight us while you were so weakened,[sr]and we were completely healed?
[k]

＠Mash
What about the death rune...?
[k]

＠Mash
You could have inscribed the same spell into us that Surtr used, but...
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
My pride would not permit it. I am obligated to protect this land and all the lives that dwell within.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
I must heal the wounds Surtr inflicted upon this land. I must repair the village he destroyed, and treat those whom he injured.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
I never had much magical energy to spare...
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
...for my battle with you. Hehe.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Ahh, there they are. Look up at the sky,[sr]and I shall tell you those birds' names.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
They are the holy ravens who served Odin.
[k]

＠Goredolf
Odin's familiars!? Th-then, they must be Huginn and Muninn, two of the greatest familiars to ever exist!
[k]

＠Goredolf
They're legendary Divine Beasts named after thought and memory who were said to look upon the whole world every morning...
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Cursed Odin... He may have kept giving me chances,[sr]right to the end...
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
...but it seems he had Huginn and Muninn guide all of you as well. Haha... How very...like him...
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
He never was...willing to guide me...
