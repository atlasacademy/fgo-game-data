Aww, maybe she didn't like me calling her that.[sr]It's too bad we can't communicate more easily.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Still...that gave me the push I needed. Time to take responsibility for looking the other way all this time.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Peperoncino
I wonder if you understood what we[sr]were really doing here, [%1].
[k]

＠Peperoncino
We didn't give the people of this world weapons and teach them to fight so they could live.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
We just wanted them to survive to use them to defeat Arjuna, with no real concern for what came afterward.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
The only reason we helped these people was so that we could more efficiently erase their god, and eventually, them.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Peperoncino
The Servants may have known[sr]enough to keep quiet about it...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...but I could see how it wore on you and Mashie.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Peperoncino
I'm sure you both wished there was a way these people could all live happily ever after from now on.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
But you both know you don't have any right to say that when you're taking their future away from them.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Peperoncino
That's very responsible of you,[sr]especially when you're both still so young.
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠Peperoncino
But, unfortunately, none of that matters to me.[sr]I can say it all I want.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
These people aren't livestock reduced to following a god gone wrong. They deserve more than that.
[k]

[charaFace B 6]

＠Peperoncino
So as one of the people responsible for helping them take back their lives, I'm coming down on their side now.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Peperoncino
All right...time to take care[sr]of this last bit of business.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Otherwise, how could I show my[sr]face to Kadoc, Ophelia, and Akuta?

＠Peperoncino
You understand, right, [%1]? This is[sr]the fourth Lostbelt you've seen so far, correct?
[k]

＠Peperoncino
It's peaceful here. There's hope for the future, and love to be had just by being alive. You could live a full life here.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
It's rare for a world to turn out like this, even if the people who live here don't know that.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
In the big picture, it's never[sr]been troubled by war or revolt.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
And in the little picture, it's never had to worry about communities growing old and dying off, or a beloved brand going under, or a hot new trend fizzling out.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
The more complicated society gets, the harder it gets to survive in it. It's cruel and unforgiving, and so many things slip through the cracks.
[k]

[charaFace B 4]

＠Peperoncino
But this Lostbelt never had anything like that.[sr]Life was simple here. People were happy.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...That's why it was destroyed. Pruned away.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
History decided this world was too happy, too perfect, and pruned it away for being unnecessary.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Peperoncino
Can you believe that? You people fighting for humanity always say you want peace...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...but then you go and reject a world like this[line 2]a truly peaceful place. It's like you can't conceive of a world not dominated by pain and suffering.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
So I don't ever want to hear you say that Proper Human History is more peaceful than any of these worlds.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Trust me, your world is a crueler, more disgusting hell than any world you'll find in a Lostbelt.

Suit yourself, hon. Just don't expect a thank-you.[sr]Although, are you sure you're okay with this?
