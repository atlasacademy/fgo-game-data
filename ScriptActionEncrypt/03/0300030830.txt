＠Holmes
Much as I would like to laugh the notion off,[sr]we have seen ample evidence of their cohabitation.
[k]

＠Holmes
These Demonic Beasts have been[sr]quite thoroughly altered...
[k]

＠Holmes
So much so that they have begun sharing their territory with altogether different species.

So someone's been going around domesticating the same beasts that led to their Lostbelts getting pruned away... Pretty horrible hobby.

Maybe they don't have an end in mind.

＠Jing Ke
You said this Koyanskaya went around the other Lostbelts tormenting innocent people for kicks, right?
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

＠Jing Ke
Maybe releasing man-eating beasts into peaceful agricultural villages with no defenses is just more of that...
