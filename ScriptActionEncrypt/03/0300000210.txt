The blizzard has come and gone.[sr]Now all that remains is clear blue sky.

Before long, the pale blue is marked by the single black dot of an approaching helicopter. The helicopter brings important passengers, and the harsh reality that the end is close at hand.

Goredolf Musik. Male, twenty-eight years old.[sr]Heir to a wealthy family of alchemists.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
At the Clock Tower, where the Mage's Association is headquartered, he's considered to be...well, about average.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Much as the Musiks can boast a long familial history, within the world of magecraft, they have essentially accomplished nothing.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The only thing that sets them apart from the other mages is the extra bit of wealth they've accumulated by virtue of existing longer.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Goredolf's basically just a rich brat from a well-off family. The question is, why did someone like that end up as Chaldea's new director?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I can't be certain until we meet him ourselves,[sr]but if I were to guess[line 2]

I'm afraid you have no grounds to do so.[sr]Not until this investigation is over, at least.

＠Da Vinci
Have the powers that be already ruled that Chaldea is no more than a criminal cartel, and you have simply neglected to inform us?

Because I am quite sure that if that were the case, you would have come with more in the way of soldiers.

We ARE the mysterious organization that saved the whole world, after all. If there was a warrant out for our arrest, you would have come with a small army at the very least.

It would be all too easy to take over Chaldea with force, and I assure you, that is a decision the Mage's Association would back wholeheartedly.

“Their magecraft theories are nonsense,” and, “They're just a bunch of incompetent frauds,” or, “They're a disgrace to the Twelve Lords”...

I used the entirety of the Musik family fortune to buy all Chaldea's assets and prevent its dismantling.

All I know about Father Kotomine is that he's from the Holy Church[line 2]another organization that's long butted heads with the Mage's Association.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
As their name suggests, the Holy Church is a mysterious organization based on a religion that has followers all around the globe.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They see Mystics as something that's solely under their domain, and suffer neither magecraft nor heresy in the name of their Lord.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Their mission is more or less to bring all human knowledge under their control.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They were a lot more aggressive about that back when I was alive, but nowadays they seem to be playing their cards much closer to their chest.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I'm guessing that priest must be part of their combat team. Executors, I think they call them.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They're supposed to be devotees of the blade who spread God's teachings in His absence. That's all you need to know about them.

These Executors are both faithful and heretical... Monsters who fight the mages and mystical creatures.

All right. Now that we have an agreement,[sr]my dear [%1], here's my first question:
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
How much do you know about Chaldea?
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I'm told you were scouted in some random country and brought here directly...
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
...but no matter how you slice it, you were born into a commoner's family. I bet you didn't even know the first thing about magecraft before you came here, did you?
[k]

[charaFace F 6]

＠Koyanskaya
No, no. Don't answer. It's all over your face. Hmm...[sr]I see. So you had a strong aptitude for Rayshifting.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I can't believe you came all this way on that alone.[sr]Do you even know where you are?
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
They probably didn't even tell you which country Chaldea is located in, did they?
[k]

？1：All I know is we're on a very tall mountain...
？2：...Now that you mention it...

？！

[charaFace F 20]

＠Koyanskaya
You're at the heart of one of the most secluded areas in the world, one not in the borders of any nation. An unobservable mountain that's been hidden behind a barrier of magecraft for hundreds of years.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Had Chaldea actually told you where you'd be going when they recruited you, I doubt you'd have ever signed up.
[k]

[charaFace F 9]

＠Koyanskaya
I can practically see your protests, asking if they've lost their mind, expecting you to go so far away.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Koyanskaya
Trust me, this place is as isolated as you can get. I could show you the six months' worth of paperwork it took to buy this place to prove it.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Koyanskaya
But, never mind that.[sr]It doesn't concern you, anyway.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
The thing I'm dying to learn more about is the original forty-eight Masters.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
Of those, nine are still here: Mash Kyrielight,[sr]the seven Team A masters in cryostorage, and you.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
The other thirty-nine have been revived and sent home.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
No doubt they went back to living their lives in peace, but the thing is, their personal information still goes for a very high price.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
And why wouldn't it? Now that it's been proven that Rayshifting is possible, each of those candidates is worth their weight in gold.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
But none of them are likely to fetch as high a price as Team A. They were the seven people who were originally meant to save the world, not you.
[k]

[charaFace F 18]

＠Koyanskaya
Oh, wait, that's not right, is it?[sr]Let me rephrase that.

＠Da Vinci
He's the head of the exceptionally distinguished Wodime family, whose name and magical circuits have both been around for thousands of years.

＠Da Vinci
He's also Marisbury's top pupil, and was rumored to be a better heir to the Lordship than Olga Marie.

His story is pretty similar to yours, seeing as he was the only ordinary member among all the geniuses on Team A.

But his kindness more than made up for it, even if it did descend into self-deprecation at times.

He was a freelance mage Marisbury recruited after they met abroad.

He was also the oldest member of the team.[sr]You could say he was a man a bit ahead of his time.

＠Da Vinci
He was expected to form a contract with an Archer. He had an Italian air about him, but he was also strangely knowledgeable about Buddhism.

She was the kind of person who would have been happy doing nothing more than curling up with a good book from morning till night.

That would be the Folklore Department, or Brishsan, if you're wondering. They deal with otherworldly artifacts.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's an unorthodox field of study despite being led by the Clock Tower's chancellor.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Anyway, Marisbury had the highest regard for Daybit's talent. I thought he was a rare find too.
[k]

There's only one, maybe two other people I recognized as geniuses even when I was alive...

＠Da Vinci
And that's every Master on Team A.[sr]Quite the cast of characters, right?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But don't let that get to you. If anything, they're the ones who would be timid around YOU now.

＠Da Vinci
They may have been your senpai a year ago, but now, you're the senpai, and you've got the experience to prove it.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Team A is nothing if not a meritocracy. They respect people based on their accomplishments, and yours have been pretty incredible.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't bank on getting any sleep for a week or so once they're awake. They'll be constantly bugging you to tell them all about your experiences in the Singularities.

Wodime has a great tea stash, as you'd expect from a noble. Kadoc can be shy, but he's very studious, and is hugely into mythology.

Pepe was a great listener. Even Akuta, who usually never said much of anything, would open up in front of him.

Indeed. I have no doubt that half of Team A would get along great with you, [%1].

Which is exactly why I'm concerned. Thawing them out will have a profound effect on Chaldea's future.

＠Da Vinci
Goredolf is moving full steam ahead with the thaw, but it'll still take at least four days to get all the equipment ready.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I can only hope they finish investigating the current staff before they get started...

＠Mash
I agree. Our term lasts until the very end of the year.
[k]

＠Mash
So if the investigation concludes by the 31st,[sr]we should just be able to help thaw them out.
[k]

？1：The very end of the year...
？2：Only four days to go...

＠Da Vinci
Right. Whether you stay or go, this is still our problem to handle, at least for now.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
If something were to go down, it'd definitely[sr]be on the last day of the year, the 31st.
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠Da Vinci
So let's just be patient, keep our guard up, and wait for the right opportunity. Sound good, Master of Chaldea?
