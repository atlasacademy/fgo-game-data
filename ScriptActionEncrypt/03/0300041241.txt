I blink out of sheer boredom.

There is something there. Something within my memories fighting alongside my beloved friends and brothers.

Wanting nothing more than to grant their wishes, my arrows found their way into every one of our hated enemies.

I fought earnestly, with no shame, proud to be counted among my brothers' ranks.

Thanks to my Rojintsu[line 2]the only power I was born with[line 2]I couldn't help but be “enlightened” about that.

My life has no value.[sr]I'm just a pitiful jester, born to a pitiful world.
