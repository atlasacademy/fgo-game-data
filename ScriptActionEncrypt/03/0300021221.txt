＠Brynhild
...Now do you see the difference in our power?
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Brynhild
Know the grief of one of your sisters' destruction.[sr]Any further loss would be meaningless.
[k]

＠Brynhild
I am sure another will be manufactured,[sr]but that is not the same as returning from death.
[k]

＠Brynhild
It only means a new one will have been created in her place. Individually, your lives are so very finite.
[k]

＠Brynhild
Now leave, my sisters.[sr]Please, don't make me destroy any more of you.

That voice...[sr]I've heard it before...
[k]

＠Thrúd
You mentioned a difference in power? True, these mass-produced units are no match for you individually.
[k]

＠Thrúd
But we do have numbers on our side! I wonder...
[k]

＠Thrúd
How long can you last against a hundred mass-produced Valkyries, Sister!? How about you, Chaldean dregs!?

I haven't just been fixing the Border up all this time![sr]I also figured the giants out!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They're basically biological heat-seeking missiles. If something's warm, they go after it! Humans, animals, Heroic Spirits... They'll go after any of them!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Including the Valkyries, too. They've got artificial hearts, and their bodies are just as warm as a human's!

She's got to be up there somewhere![sr]If we can find her, and take her out...
