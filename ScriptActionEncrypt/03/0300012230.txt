For a moment, I flashed back to[sr]Solomon and the Temple of Time.
[k]

＠
First, there was a strong, destructive light... It was so powerful, I was certain it would end me. Then, there was the light that guided me back to life...to what I thought was lost.
[k]

＠
That was the moment when I picked[sr]up my shield and stepped forward.
[k]

＠
Back then, the only reason I could do it was[sr]because I felt it was the right thing to do.
[k]

＠
I was scared, yes, but more than that,[sr]I was proud...and, deep down, lonely.
[k]

＠
I thought that, even if we won this battle, I would never again get to spend time with [&him:her]. I couldn't help but be a bit sad about that.
[k]

＠
But that's not true anymore. Now, all my pride is gone, along with any sense of what the right thing to do is.
[k]

＠
I never did get over my concerns.[sr]Instead of sadness, I'm overcome by fear.
[k]

I'm scared that I may not be in the right. That what we're doing may just be a cruel, empty victory.

＠
If all sides are equally in the right...then I want to protect what I can't bear to lose.
[k]

＠
To fight once again for the life I gained on that journey. So I'm asking you now...

...Please, Galahad.[sr]Please, lend me your shield once again...!
