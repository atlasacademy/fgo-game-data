＠Avicebron
After I was summoned as a Servant,[sr]I began killing people.
[k]

＠Avicebron
...I doubt I am the first to dirty hands as a Servant that were so determinedly kept clean in life.
[k]

＠Avicebron
Once one has been summoned as a Servant, bloodshed is all but inevitable. Especially given how central it is to Holy Grail Wars. They are, after all, events held for the sole purpose of fulfilling mages' desires.
[k]

＠Avicebron
And in one such Holy Grail War,[sr]I proved to be the worst kind of Servant imaginable.
[k]

＠Avicebron
All I have ever desired is to recreate the[sr]Primordial Man and save my persecuted people.
[k]

＠Avicebron
I threw away the sense of pride and the morals[sr]that I held so dear, all in pursuit of that goal.
[k]

＠Avicebron
I killed my own Master, who was just a child.
[k]

＠Avicebron
...I only know about this from records of the event.[sr]I can't remember their name or face.
[k]

＠Avicebron
Such a horrible deed,[sr]and I cannot remember anything about it.
[k]

＠Avicebron
But the records speak for themselves.
[k]

＠Avicebron
They torment me, proving beyond any doubt I am just[sr]as driven by my desires as any other ruthless mage.

Whether a Servant remembers or not probably depends on them, and the sort of memories they're dealing with.
[k]

＠Beowulf
I know I don't care about remembering fighting in any boring-ass war, but I'd at least like to remember saving the world.
[k]

This is madness! You're playing the piano and the rest of the orchestra all on your own!? How have you been doing this for so long!? You hate hard work! You grow bored almost at the drop of a hat...!
[k]

Well that's not very nice. Sure, I'd much rather just play a single song, get paid, and go back to my life of leisure.
[k]

＠Amadeus
But given who I'm playing for this time,[sr]even I can't help but be motivated.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Besides, the Tsar was on the verge of waking up when I began to play. I didn't dare to give him anything but my best.

He could easily end up grinding this entire country to a pulp if he were to wake up, after all. What choice did I have but to ensure he kept dreaming sweet dreams?

You mean a greedy miser like you has been playing his[sr]heart out here in the frigid cold for months on end...
[k]

＠Salieri
...for a demented old man who couldn't understand your worth if his life depended on it...!?
[k]

＠Amadeus
No need to be so rude to him. Though I will grant you that he's rather up there in years.
[k]

＠Amadeus
The Tsar has been an excellent audience. He told me my music was like paradise itself.
[k]

＠Amadeus
But, I'm afraid I'm at my limit. In fact, I won't be around much longer. This environment was just too much for a frail Servant like me.
[k]

＠Amadeus
I can't even move my fingers anymore. It's worse than the illness I contracted before I died the first time.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Still, if I have to die again here, I don't want to do it without being useful in some way.

So I thought you should kill me. I even told[sr]Macarius that was my condition for helping out.

Why not? If you hate me enough to kill me,[sr]go ahead and get it out of your system.
[k]

＠Amadeus

Just don't expect it to save your life or anything. I might be a peerless genius, but there are some things even I can't help with.

[k]

＠Amadeus
This is always how it went with us, wasn't it?
[k]

＠Amadeus
I'd show up unannounced, challenge you out of nowhere,[sr]then make impossible demands when I won.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Why break with precedent now? Salieri, when this is all over, would you play Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star for me?
[k]

[charaFace A 7]

＠Salieri
...What are you...?
[k]

＠Amadeus
...I knew it would come to this.
[k]

＠Amadeus
I may not have any hope of surviving,[sr]but you still have a chance to win.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Salieri. It's all about timing.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Friends and enemies alike must work together...or no one will be able to defeat that thing.
[k]

＠Amadeus
Salieri, you stayed closer to me than anyone else. You kept on hating me, even knowing your hate would never be requited. I always appreciated that.
[k]

So until the time to defeat the Tsar comes...I'm going to leave his lullaby to you.
