＠Peperoncino
In China, Crown Prince Nezha's father is known as Tuō Tǎ Lǐ Tiān Wáng, aka Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li, aka Li Jing.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
And in Japan, Li Jing is considered to be the same as the figures I mentioned before, Tamonten and Bishamonten.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
There's a lot of cross-pollination between Taoist lore and Buddhist myth when it comes to gods like these, so it can be difficult to make sense of...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
But the long and short of it is, we can be pretty sure that Li Jing and the Hindu god Kubēra are one and the same.

The details are a little different between Journey to the West and The Investiture of the Gods...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...but basically, Nezha was born with tremendous power, and wrecked a lot of things even as a baby.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Her father acted in anger and fear,[sr]and Nezha lost her body as a result.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She was later reborn into a new being thanks to the Buddha and Taiyi Zhenren.
[k]

[charaFace D 13]

＠Da Vinci
Well, the real story might be more complicated than that, but that's an accurate picture of the central relationships.

It is therefore impossible for me to tell what I think and feel now that both beings have been combined within me.

It is not right for Li Jing to exist inside Nezha.[sr]It is utterly preposterous!

Good point. If you wished to end your life, you could have done so any other number of ways. For example...

[charaFace C 5]

＠Lakshmi
...you could have fought back against the god who made you that way with all of your might. Since he trusted you enough to bestow you with power, you should have had plenty of chances to attack him if you chose.

＠Nezha
And if I lost, he might decide to erase my consciousness for being defective.

[charaFace I 5]

＠Nezha
Then I would truly become nothing more than a puppet with Nezha's body and Kubēra's power.
