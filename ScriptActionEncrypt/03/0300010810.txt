It's really not a question of “how many” at this point. You're perfectly capable of fighting plenty now.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Remember, you awoke the Spirit Origin that[sr]had been dormant in you for the last year.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You might not be quite as strong as you once were, what with the extreme cold and all, but it's not as if fighting is causing you a lot of pain, right?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And THAT is because your body has acclimated[sr]to being a Demi-Servant again.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
At this point, it's actually all just a mental thing.[sr]Of course, that's really the biggest challenge of all!

[charaFace B 5]

[bgmStop BGM_EVENT_81 0.5]

＠Da Vinci
Yup. I bet he did, the jerk.[sr]I'm pretty annoyed about that myself.
[k]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_79 0.1]

＠Da Vinci
It's been a year since the battle at the Temple of Time. After handling your medical care during that whole time, there's one thing I can say for sure.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Galahad isn't helping you anymore. That so-called[sr]“Holy Knight” abandoned his responsibility to you.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He might as well have written you a Dear John letter to say he wasn't going to help anymore and you'll just have to take care of yourself from now on.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So, yeah...he's bailed on you,[sr]and he isn't coming back. Ever.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mash
...B-but then, how was I able to transform...?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Da Vinci
Simple. You and Galahad are different people. He only really allowed you to give form to his power... You were borrowing it from him.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And thanks to your experience in battle,[sr]you grew into your own as a Knight of the Shield.
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠Da Vinci
The person you were when you fused with that Heroic Spirit and the person you are now are pretty much completely different people at this point.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Galahad may be gone, but YOU are a full-fledged[sr]Demi-Servant in your own right, now.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Get it? The harm transforming has been doing to you, and the fact that your Spirit Origin seems weaker...none of that has to do with Galahad.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's all you. Your body. Your mind.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Your weakness is just the state your body is in, and your inability to transform as completely as you'd like is just a matter of your own mind holding you back.
[k]


＠Mash
...C-can you be more specific?
[k]

＠Mash
Does that mean if I can resolve those two problems,[sr]I can be useful to everyone again...!?
[k]

[messageOff]
[charaTalk B]
[charaFace B 24]
[wt 1.0]
[charaFace B 7]

＠Da Vinci
Well, with Galahad gone, your Spirit Origin dropped pretty sharply. You've lost more than half your power.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's no wonder you're not as strong as you used to be.[sr]So that's the plain old physical problem.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It also means you've lost the skills, gifts,[sr]and protection that came from his legend.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
From here on, you'll need to develop[sr]and hone your own way of fighting.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Da Vinci
Of course, we can help you with that.[sr]We just have to get back to the original plan.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Mash
The original plan...[sr]You mean, Project Ortinax?
[k]

[charaFace B 23]

＠Da Vinci
Oh, you know about that?[sr]Did Romani tell you?
[k]

[charaFace A 3]

＠Mash
Oh, um... Actually, I heard about it from Director Marisbury. He said Heroic Spirits would probably reject a Demi-Servant...
[k]

＠Mash
...so Project Ortinax would make up for any difficulty[sr]I might have in functioning properly as a Servant...
[k]

[charaFace B 14]

＠Da Vinci
...(Sigh) I can't believe he had that much foresight and still didn't think to stop the Demi-Servant experiments...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Just what did he think Heroic Spirit bodies are, anyway? He should be ashamed of himself, letting them degrade just so he could accomplish his goal.
[k]

[charaFace B 16]

＠Da Vinci
Well, not that I've been overly picky about my own methods. Me standing here now talking to you is proof enough, I suppose!
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Da Vinci
Aaanywho, your physical strength issue should take care of itself over time. We can talk more about that later.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So that leaves the mental aspect, Mash.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Right now, you're scared to transform. Your body refuses to make the Servant transformation because you are so riddled with doubts.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Mash
Doubts...? I am?
[k]

[charaFace B 5]

＠Da Vinci
Yes, and I don't mean our last conversation[sr]about how being a Servant could harm you.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
I... Okay.[sr]So...you're saying there's a different problem?
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Da Vinci
Yup. This time, you don't REALLY want to fight.[sr]Of course, that may have been true for all the other times as well.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But when we were fighting to save humanity, it was obvious we were doing the right thing. So, because of that, you were able to fight in spite of your fear.
[k]

[charaFace B 25]

＠Da Vinci
But that's not true anymore.[sr]We aren't facing that kind of threat this time around.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
You can sense it.[sr]And I'm sure [%1] can too.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And that makes this an even bigger problem than Galahad being gone OR the harmful side effects of your transformation into a Servant.
[k]

[charaFace B 24]

＠Da Vinci
Mash Kyrielight.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Can you fight for what you believe is right, even against your fellow man... Even when that enemy hasn't done anything wrong?

[charaFace E 10]

＠Goredolf
All we've learned is that Russia has been overrun by a bunch of beastly barbarians!
[k]

＠Holmes
Goredolf, they are not beasts. They are Yaga.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Goredolf
Isn't that just what they've DECIDED to call themselves?
[k]

＠Holmes
Not at all. The Kabbalah and alchemy may both be magecraft, but they are also quite different.
[k]

＠Holmes
Their magecraft base and their spells may both differ greatly...
[k]

＠Holmes
...but both are part of a system of knowledge and mechanics that is collectively known as magecraft.
[k]

＠Holmes
Beastmen and Yaga may appear the same to you,[sr]but I assure you they are entirely different.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]

＠Holmes
The creatures you refer to, Goredolf, are werewolves, lycanthropes, and the like.
[k]

＠Holmes
They are Demonic Beasts who are awakened[sr]to their true nature by blood.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Holmes
However, Yaga are a fusion of Demonic Beast and human.
[k]

＠Holmes
As such, their closest approximation would be combined Phantasmals, such as Chimeras.
[k]

＠Goredolf
Hmm, I see.[sr]So Yaga and Beastmen have different origins, eh...
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

＠Holmes
Correct.[sr]However, the fundamental issue lies elsewhere.
[k]

[charaFace E 10]

＠Goredolf
Oh?
[k]

＠Holmes
Listen closely. The Yaga...have formed a country.[sr]They have their own culture, their own way of life.
[k]

[charaFace E 0]

＠Goredolf
...And is that in some way different from the Singularities you CLAIM to have resolved?
[k]

＠Holmes
Yes. Very much so.
[k]

＠Holmes
The Singularities we resolved created hypothetical versions of history at different points in time.
[k]

＠Holmes
Think of each as something of a diversion[sr]from the main track of history.
[k]

＠Holmes
Chaldea resolved these Singularities by Rayshifting to those points in time and setting history back on its proper course.
[k]

＠Holmes
This is different, though. The divergent point in history seems to be four hundred and fifty years ago.
[k]

＠Holmes
Most likely, it occurred at the moment that the Great Cold Wave hit and Ivan the Terrible merged with Demonic Beasts to become a Yaga.
[k]

[charaFace E 10]

＠Goredolf
Then this world's Singularity occurred in the past?[sr]It's over?
[k]

＠Holmes
Precisely.
[k]

＠Holmes
In other words, the hypothetical history this Singularity created has continued into the present.
[k]

＠Holmes
Take Patxi's scoped bolt-action hunting rifle, for example. It is very similar to a modern-day gun.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]

＠Holmes
But it is still far from cutting-edge technology. I believe it is made with engineering that, from our standpoint, would be half a century out-of-date.
[k]

＠Holmes
But that sort of firearm WAS cutting edge back[sr]when it was introduced in Ivan the Terrible's era.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

＠Holmes
Furthermore, this one has a major trait that sets it apart even from our own modern-day weaponry.
[k]

＠Holmes
It is specifically designed to kill Demonic Beasts.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Goredolf
Ah, yes. I noticed that as well.[sr]I have a similar magical gun myself, you see.
[k]

＠Goredolf
When he fired his gun, a spell was activated,[sr]though it was a primitive one.
[k]

＠Holmes
I believe that weapon was made with[sr]the intention to be used by the Yaga.
[k]

＠Holmes
Most likely, it uses magical energy instead of additional gunpowder to increase its muzzle velocity, thereby increasing its rounds' penetrative power.
[k]

＠Holmes
Patxi seemed perfectly comfortable with it,[sr]as did the other Yaga.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Holmes
And from that we can deduce that this world is entirely separate from our own; it followed an entirely different track of history than ours did.
[k]

＠Holmes
As such, it would be inappropriate to call it a Singularity.
[k]

[charaFace E 10]

＠Goredolf
...I don't care WHAT you call it. We have a much more important question that needs answering:
[k]

＠Goredolf
Will overthrowing Ivan the Terrible[sr]actually solve the problem here?
[k]

[charaFace D 4]

＠Holmes
...Given the nature of our enemy, I do think defeating him would have SOME effect on this world.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]

＠Goredolf
Come now, aren't you the world's greatest detective? Aren't you supposed to have brilliant flashes of insight or something?
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Holmes
I'm afraid there is very little to work with, even[sr]in the way of circumstantial evidence. [bgmStop BGM_EVENT_81 0.5]Besides...
[k]

？1：Besides?
？2：(Oh, for... Here we go...)
？！

[charaFace D 1]

[bgm BGM_EVENT_7 0.1]

＠Goredolf
Ugh! He actually said it!
[k]

？1：That's the great detective for you...
？！

＠Holmes
Hahaha. That said, we may not yet know the full extent of the situation, but the problem isn't especially complex.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Holmes
After all, we know exactly who our enemy is: a version of Ivan the Terrible who has been ruling Russia for roughly five hundred years.
[k]

＠Holmes
That is the single largest point of differentiation between our Russia's history and this one. There can be no doubt that he is key to this world.
[k]

＠Holmes
For the moment, our interests would best be served by continuing to aid the rebel army, as that is sure to lead us to Ivan the Terrible in due time.
[k]

[charaFace E 10]

＠Goredolf
...So what you're saying is that we've got a long road ahead, full of twists and turns. Dammit!
[k]

？1：That's not all.
？2：There's something else we should discuss too.
？！

[charaFace D 6]

＠Holmes
Indeed. The human mage serving Ivan the Terrible,[sr]and their human-looking Servant.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Holmes
The latter is most likely the woman we saw at Chaldea.[sr]Of course, it could also be Koyanskaya or the priest.
[k]

[charaFace E 9]

＠Goredolf
Just thinking about them gives me chills.[sr]...Well, me and my bank account, in Koyanskaya's case.

The most pressing problem is the mage...
[k]

＠Holmes
Kirschtaria called himself a Crypter.
[k]

＠Holmes
He also said that there were seven of them...which corresponds to the number of mages from Team A who disappeared from their Coffins.
[k]

＠Holmes
It follows, then, that one of those seven[sr]mages is now serving Ivan the Terrible.
[k]

＠Holmes
Assuming we wish to take Koyanskaya at her word,[sr]the mage is Kadoc Zemlupus...
[k]


＠Holmes
...Of course, we cannot be certain[sr]that is the case at this stage.
[k]

＠Holmes
But if it is, then we must ask ourselves what measures he is likely to take to deal with us...

And there were other sources of inspiration, like Solodiviy Bunio, whose fiery gaze could reduce entire towns to ash, and Boniak, who is said to have killed no fewer than forty thousand people.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
Viy is the Romanovs' little[sr]Easter egg[line 2]our secret weapon.
[k]

＠Kadoc
Maybe he wandered into Proper Human History from the Lostbelt... Viy's power always was...abnormal, even in his own time.
[k]

＠Kadoc
Well, for my part, I was also surprised to find you were a mage, in the true sense of the word.
[k]








＠Grand Duchess
...I suppose. Now that I've been redefined as a Heroic Spirit, I've become a mage representing the version of Russia we are in now.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
I may have been a pathetic failure in Proper Human History, but in this Lostbelt, I've become a Grand Duchess of Ice.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
...And it's all thanks to you, Kadoc Zemlupus.
[k]

[charaFace G 10]

＠Kadoc
...I'm sorry for the twisted way I summoned you. It's just, that was the only way I could make sure you'd be a powerful Heroic Spirit.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Grand Duchess
Ah, was what I said unclear?[sr]I was thanking you, in my own way.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
I don't mind that I am irregular. Thanks to that,[sr]I cannot even remember my family's faces clearly.
[k]


[charaFace F 0]

＠Grand Duchess
I may look like a human on the outside,[sr]but inside, I'm much more Yaga.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
And because you summoned me to this Lostbelt,[sr]where even historical records are muddled...
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
...all I can remember is that[sr]I'm Anastasia, the Grand Duchess...
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
...and a shaman who made a pact with Viy.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
Either way, I have no attachment whatsoever to Proper Human History. I'm happy to be a Lostbelt Servant.
[k]

[charaFace F 1]

＠Grand Duchess
You don't have to worry about anything.[sr]You are free to make use of me however you see fit.
[k]

[charaFace G 1]

＠Kadoc
I know. Believe me, I have every intention of taking advantage of that power of yours.
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Grand Duchess
It is thanks to this power that I am able to kill.
[k]

＠Grand Duchess
I will kill Chaldea, so that they no longer get in our way.[sr]I will kill the rebel army, who would defy the tsardom even in this Lostbelt Russia.
[k]

Of course not. Don't worry, I'm only joking.[sr]I would never put on a ball.

[charaFace F 5]

The next time you do that, I'll freeze your feet to the floor and make you sleep in the hallway standing up.

There. That's exactly what I'm talking about, Master.

I know a four-hour nap isn't much, but I bet[sr]it's a lot better than sleeping outside!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Now, here's some coffee and a plate of hard-boiled eggs...or at least, rations that kinda resemble them.
[k]

[charaFace B 9]

＠Da Vinci
We ran out of eggs WAY back, sadly. Still, doesn't this make it feel like a typical morning inside a cramped submarine?
[k]

？1：Thanks, Da Vinci.

？！

[charaFace B 7]

＠Da Vinci
No problem. Anyway, now that you're awake,[sr]there's something important we have to discuss.
[k]

？1：Hey, where's Mash...?

[charaFace B 8]

＠Da Vinci
Yeah, that's what I wanted to talk about.[sr]I've put her back on navigation duty.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Da Vinci
Nice to see you're still quick on the uptake! And[sr]thanks for worrying about her; that's kind of you.
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠Da Vinci
I've put Mash back in her old role as navigator.
[k]

？！

＠Da Vinci
She's on board, naturally.
[k]

[charaFace B 7]

＠Da Vinci
Your Heroic Spirit summoning went great.[sr]Avicebron is proving to be a very dependable Servant.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
He's probably the best one we could've hoped for in this frozen wasteland. You can't fight the cold with combat prowess alone now, can you?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Even Napoleon ended up losing to Russia's cold,[sr]and that was PROPER Human History, to boot!
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠Da Vinci
But Avicebron's golems can serve as walls AND labor.[sr]Hell, they're fixing the Border even as we speak.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And of course, they make great soldiers too.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So since Mash can't fight, there's no reason for her to accompany you, or for you to have to keep her safe.
[k]

？1：...I understand. I'm fine with that.

[charaFace B 0]

＠Da Vinci
Great. Glad to hear it.
[k]

？2：Good. I don't want to add to her burden.

[charaFace B 26]

＠Da Vinci
Oh? Burden, huh?[sr]Well, in that regard, you'll just have to wait a little longer.

Now then, back to the task at hand.
[k]

[charaFace D 5]

＠Holmes
Our goal remains the same: find out what has happened here. Thanks to your previous efforts, we now know several things:
[k]

＠Holmes
There is a new race of people called Yaga. Ivan the Terrible lives, and has ruled for the past five hundred years. An endless storm rages at the fringes of this world. And there is the mysterious tree...
[k]

＠Holmes
I believe unraveling the mysteries of each of these points will determine our future course of action.
[k]

＠Holmes
To begin, we need more information on Ivan the Terrible. Fortunately, we have the rebel army's trust.
[k]

＠Holmes
At present, we plan to continue working with[sr]them in an effort to make our way to him.
[k]

[charaFace D 0]

＠Holmes
If at all possible, I would like to help[sr]the rebel army with their aims as well.

[k]

＠Holmes
If the rebel army hasn't heard any such rumors, then it is safe to assume there is no Heroic Spirit in this world who could save it single-handedly.
[k]

＠Holmes
Of course...there is always the possibility that they HAVE heard such rumors, and simply haven't yet told us.
[k]

[charaFace E 5]
