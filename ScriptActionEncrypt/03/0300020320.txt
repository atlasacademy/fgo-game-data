He's still somewhere inside the Border...[sr]He appears to be headed for the cockpit!

You sure about this, old man!?[sr]If you give him that, we'll be[line 2]!

Stop that! Shut your mouth before he kills us all![sr]We don't have any other choice! Trust me!

Here! This is the Paper Moon you said[sr]you were looking for! Go on, take it!
[k]

＠Goredolf
Normally, we'd keep it hidden, but you're so strong[sr]that I decided to give it to you as a reward!

Still, I didn't think you'd give it up so easily.[sr]I heard this thing was your lifeline.

I-i-it may be our lifeline, but you are a threat to our actual lives! That thing certainly won't help fill our bellies!

＠Goredolf
N-now go on, you got what you came here for, didn't you?[sr]You don't have any further business with us, right? Right?
[k]

＠Goredolf
Without the Paper Moon, we're just helpless drifters. At this point, it's only a matter of time until we die on our own!
[k]

＠Goredolf
There's no reason for you to sully your hands with the blood of insignificant specks like us, is there? S-so why not just be on your way then!?

Ah, I see. So you got a little boost from the Heroic Spirit who doesn't know when he's beaten.

All right. It wouldn't hurt to put this body through its paces a little more, anyway.
