She was said to be one of Odin's loyal Valkyries, and Sigurd the Dragon Slayer's spouse.

Sitonai said he might not belong to this Lostbelt,[sr]and I'm inclined to agree.

This Lostbelt's been exactly[sr]the same ever since 1000 B.C.
[k]

＠Napoleon
It's a world basically designed by and for Scáthach-Skadi. A world where the entire human population has been locked down for nearly three thousand years.
[k]


＠Napoleon
No one here has any desires intense enough to create an evil dragon like Fafnir for Sigurd to slay.
[k]

＠Napoleon
What's more, there's no economy to stimulate desire.[sr]Hell, there's not even any concept of a nation-state.

＠Napoleon
Something about Sigurd besides whether he's from the Age of Gods or the A.D. era!
[k]

＠Napoleon
At the very least, we know that in this Lostbelt, Sigurd would never have been born. And even if he had, he could never have become a hero, as there could not have been an evil dragon for him to defeat!

That Shadow Border thing of yours is around somewhere too, right? A band of humans and Heroic Spirits, all working together to restore humanity!

It's been what, four, five days since we first met? It's probably about time you brought your shield and armor in for a tune-up, mademoiselle.

[charaFace G 6]

Since we've met up with the third goddess and all,[sr]now seems like a good time to head back.

You said they were located[sr]around southern Sweden, right?

[charaFace D 0]

＠Mash
That's right. The Border is parked[sr]in southern Sweden, near Norrköping.
[k]

＠Mash
I think we should be able to call them again[sr]if we return to the Lake Vänern area.

[charaFace G 6]

Hmm, that's near Village 23. All right then, for the moment, let's head back to southern Sweden!
