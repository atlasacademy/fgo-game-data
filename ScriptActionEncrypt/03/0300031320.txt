However, we are not a god, but human, and the ruler of this land. It is only natural that we would value our nation over a bargain.

Confucianism is all about five virtues: justice, courtesy, wisdom, knowledge, and benevolence. It extols poetry, manners, and entertainment.

Knowledge leads to doubt. Once people are trapped by such delusions, they inevitably begin comparing themselves to others, and resent the world itself.

Confucians run rampant in your world.[sr]How long has it ever remained peaceful?
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
Humans who gain knowledge inevitably come to believe they are better than everyone else, which leads only to war, and all that creates is grief and sorrow!
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
That is why such worlds cry out in such agony as to create a Counter Force in the form of Heroic Spirits.[sr]We shiver just imagining such a hell.
