N-no[line 2]I mean yes, we ARE from Chaldea, but...

＠Yaga Chief
Yes, yes, of course.[sr]It was the second day of the bandits' attack.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
We erected a barricade and did our best to hold them off from within the village, but none of us here are strong enough to defeat even a lowly foot soldier.
[k]

[charaFace E 2]

＠Yaga Chief
Nor, unfortunately, were the bandits.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
Things may actually have been better[sr]had they clearly outmatched us.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
Had they done that, they likely would have just made off with our possessions and spared our lives.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
But unfortunately,[sr]they were just as desperate as we were.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
A number of them were injured. I imagine they must have run into some fierce resistance at the last village they attacked.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
So for them, things had reached a point[sr]where it was either kill or be killed.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
Of course we lit a distress signal soon after the attack began, but we didn't actually expect anyone to respond.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
The Oprichniki certainly wouldn't.[sr]They only exist to serve the Tsar, after all.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
At best, we held out a sliver of hope that one of the nearby villages might send someone to help.
[k]

？1：But then, help really did arrive?
？2：And that's when someone from Chaldea came?
？！

[charaFace E 1]

＠Yaga Chief
Exactly.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
...They were human, just like you,[sr]so at first, I thought they were a mage.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
...I was certain we were holed up safely, with no way for anyone to get in. But suddenly, without any warning at all, they were just...here.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
Then they approached the bandits, and asked them why they were doing something so foolish.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
That enraged the bandits, so they turned their fury on the human, but whoever the human was, they defeated all of the bandits at once!
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
Though they were completely surrounded, the human used some kind of weapon[line 2]a thin sword or something[line 2]to cut off a few of the bandits' limbs.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
I couldn't tell if it was magecraft, or a trick you might see from a street performer in a big city.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
And then, there was that frightening bloodlust.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
It was like an immense...pressure emanating from this human. I think even a Krichat' would turn tail and run from it.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
The bandits were clearly shocked. They must have realized they were facing an opponent they couldn't possibly defeat.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
The ones who remained began to panic, scrambling to get away. They fled in the direction you came from.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
We were still dumbfounded by what we'd just seen when the human audibly sighed and said:
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
“...What a headache.[sr]Once again, I have cut something worthless.”
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
To me, their sigh sounded more than a little weary,[sr]but also...kind, and comforting.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
Then, after treating the injured Yaga's wounds,[sr]they headed off into the mountains.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
By this point, I had relaxed a bit, so I called out to them and asked their name. Their only reply was...
[k]

＠
“...I'm from Chaldea.”
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
Then they clicked their tongue and went on their way.
[k]

？1：...Thank you for telling us.

？2：What did this person look like?

？！


＠Yaga Chief
Well, strangely enough...nobody[sr]can seem to remember them clearly.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
We do know their clothes were worn and they looked like they had been wandering for a long time.
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
And while their face was covered up by a hood...
[k]

＠Yaga Chief
...I distinctly remember they didn't have any fur,[sr]just like you, so I knew they weren't Yaga.

＠Goredolf
Hmm. If this person is claiming to be from Chaldea,[sr]they must be an acquaintance of yours.
[k]

＠Goredolf
They may be one of the Heroic Spirits[sr]in Chaldea's records, like Atalante.
[k]

＠Goredolf
At any rate, the important thing is that they're not our enemy. In fact, they even seem to be improving our reputation.

[charaFadein D 0.1 1]

＠Holmes
Had [&Mr.:Ms.] [%1] summoned this Servant[line 2]assuming that is what they are[line 2]it would make sense for them to say they are from Chaldea.
[k]

＠Holmes
But the only Servant we have summoned here is Avicebron.
[k]

＠Holmes
...Another possibility is that it's a Servant summoned here by the land itself, like Ms. Atalante, but that too seems highly unlikely.
[k]

[charaFace D 6]

＠Holmes
In which case...it may truly be another survivor from Chaldea.
[k]

＠Holmes
One who simply happened to wander into this[sr]frozen version of Russia, much like us.
[k]

？1：(...I wonder who it could be...)
？2：(...Someone who wanders into other worlds...?)

Well, I certainly can't refuse after you've saved our lives. We will gladly support you in any way we can.

[charaFace B 1]

＠Patxi
Great. That's two out of the three[sr]villages on our side. Not bad.
[k]

[charaFace B 0]

＠Patxi
There's nothing we can do about the one that[sr]was wiped out before we got here, though...
[k]

＠Patxi
Oh, right.
[k]

＠Patxi
There was a single survivor at the village that got wiped out. Can you send someone there to pick him up?
[k]

＠Patxi
If you can, it'd be nice for you to give him some work here. I'm sure he wasn't hurt too badly.
[k]

[charaFace E 1]

＠Yaga Chief
Well now, a survivor, you say...[sr]All right, I'll send someone out right away.

All right, I'll give our report to Atalante. Just make sure you get back to the stronghold as soon as you can.

[charaFace B 1]

...Man, it still feels weird,[sr]having people being so kind like this.

＠Patxi
Great.[sr]Well, guess this is goodbye for now.

？！

＠Patxi
Anyway, I doubt you guys're gonna betray us or get cold feet all of a sudden, but don't take too long coming back, you hear?
