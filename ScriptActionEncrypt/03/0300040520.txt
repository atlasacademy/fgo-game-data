[bgm BGM_EVENT_81 0.1]

＠Ganesha
You said we've basically got three enemies to deal with in this Lostbelt, right?
[k]

＠Ganesha
One of them's the Tree of Emptiness.[sr]If we cut this down, the whole Lostbelt goes away.
[k]

＠Ganesha
Another's the king, sort of the being at the center of this Lostbelt. They keep the Tree of Emptiness safe...probably.
[k]

＠Ganesha
And last is the Crypter, a Master who wants the Lostbelt to grow bigger instead of go away.
[k]

？1：Yeah, pretty much.
？2：There's also the Foreign God's Disciples, but otherwise, yeah.
？！

[charaFace C 0]

＠Ganesha
Hmm, hmm. So the most important thing's the Tree of Emptiness then. That's it way off in the distance there, right?

There are even more of them now than there were yesterday. I'm counting on you, child of Pārvatī.

＠Ganesha
Whoa, whoa, don't do that. Fending off wild beasts is one thing, but I have zero confidence when it comes to fighting actual demons.

＠Ganesha
When you get right down to it, I'm just a shut-in who's never had a job in her life. There's no way I can live up to expectations like that...

It may have been brief, but I did fight you myself.[sr]I have a fair idea of what you are capable of.
[k]

＠Karna
Your power is perfectly adequate. You should be more than capable of fighting alongside us.
[k]

＠Karna
Rama and I will both be trusting[sr]you to watch our backs.

(Sigh) Well, technically, I guess I am Ganesha now.

＠Ganesha
And I know old Elephant Head's gonna be upset with me if I don't show off his godly side at least a little bit.

＠Ganesha
So okay, fine! I obviously don't have a choice,[sr]so I'll do it already!

Both the Ortinax's hardware and software are working fine. For this fight, I'll be prioritizing long-term stability over explosive output.

We're up against a lot of enemies, Master,[sr]but let's do our best to push them back!
