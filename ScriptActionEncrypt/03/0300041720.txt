＠Rama
You're cursed, aren't you?
[k]

？1：Cursed!?
？2：...Did you just say “cursed”?
？！

＠Rama
That's right. Of course, there are many different kinds of curses, but for this, I believe I know what is at work.
[k]

＠Rama
Even as we speak, this curse is tormenting Aśvatthāman...
[k]

＠Rama
...or rather, his Servant Spirit Origin, relentlessly.
[k]

＠Rama
This curse must be so powerful that not even a great warrior like him can remove it.
[k]

＠Rama
I expect it is directly rooted in his destiny...
[k]

＠Rama
A curse so deeply tied to his heroics that it is inevitable he would fall prey to it.

＠Captain
...It's something that happened towards the end of the great war depicted in the Mahabharata.
[k]

＠Captain
Aśvatthāman was overcome with anger at his father's murder, and in a cowardly act of retribution, he snuck into the enemy camp and killed them all in their sleep.
[k]

＠Captain
Afterwards, he fired an arrow at the stomach of the pregnant mother of what would have been the last child of the Kuru...
[k]

＠Captain
...but Krishna protected the baby and placed a dreadful curse upon Aśvatthāman's head in retaliation.
[k]

＠Captain
One interpretation says that the curse would last for three thousand years, during which he would be forced to endure all manner of pain and suffering.

＠Peperoncino
I would definitely have noticed if he'd been cursed like that when I first summoned him.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
So Arjuna must have put the curse on him AFTER he stole my Master contract from me.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
It would be well within his power,[sr]since he also possesses Krishna's Divinity.

Aha. Now it all adds up.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Aśvatthāman, your immortality comes from being born with Yama and Shiva's power, and the curse you're dealing with now is too strong for you to remove on your own.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So you're trapped in a prison of endless suffering,[sr]and death offers no escape.

At the very least, I can imagine that curse going away once Arjuna finally has his so-called perfect world.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Though either way, I guess that doesn't leave you much choice but to cooperate with him...
