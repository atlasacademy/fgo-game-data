...Snow, ice, and fire.
[k]

＠Mash
So this is the Scandinavian Lostbelt...[sr]Looking at it again, it's all very...
[k]

？1：Strange.

＠Mash
Yes. I think so too.
[k]

＠Mash
Ice and snow need extreme cold, but fire is one of the hottest things in the world. Yet somehow, here they are, coexisting.
[k]

＠Mash
To see two such fundamentally different things mixed together like this... I don't know what to call it other than strange.
[k]

＠Mash
There doesn't seem to be anything here that can burn,[sr]but there's the fire, floating above the mountains...
[k]

＠Mash
If this isn't from Mystics, I don't know what is!
[k]

＠Fou
Fou!
[k]

？2：Beautiful.

＠Mash
Yes...that's true.[sr]It's definitely a beautiful landscape.
[k]

＠Mash
Ice and snow need extreme cold, but fire is one of the hottest things in the world. Yet somehow, here they are, coexisting.
[k]

＠Mash
I've never seen anything like it before.
[k]

＠Mash
But, at the same time...it's kind of bizarre.
[k]

＠Mash
There doesn't seem to be anything here that can burn,[sr]but there's the fire, floating above the mountains...
[k]

＠Mash
This scenery may be beautiful,[sr]but it's also incomprehensibly Mystic...
[k]

＠Fou
Fou...
[k]

？！

＠Mash
...The Ollerus Boards are great at getting around, since they can even go up inclines, but when you move at high speeds, you really won't be able to take stock of your surroundings as much.
[k]

＠Mash
Now that we're taking a break to look around,[sr]there are several things I've noticed.
[k]

＠Mash
For example, the amount of fallen snow. I read that Scandinavia actually isn't all that snowy, except for Norway.
[k]

＠Mash
But here, in this Lostbelt...[sr]The mountains are frozen over, even the trees are...
[k]

＠Mash
No, wait... Not trees, just ice shaped like conifers...?
[k]

？1：Does this mean there aren't any plants here?
？2：It does look like there's only fire, ice, and snow here.

？！

＠Mash
It certainly seems that way. At least, at this point...
[k]

＠Mash
...[sr]...
[k]

＠Mash
Maybe this means there's a different force at work here. Something very different from what caused Russia's ice age.
[k]

＠Mash
I remember hearing these Lostbelts are alternate, hypothetical versions of history.
[k]

＠Mash
What must this world's history have been[sr]like for it to have this sort of scenery...?

＠Mash
Look, Senpai![bgm BGM_EVENT_77 0.1][sr]Birds!
[k]

＠Mash
That must mean this Lostbelt has other, normal animals and not just giants and Demonic Beasts!
[k]

？1：Looks that way.


？2：I'm kind of relieved to see that.

＠Mash
Right. The fact that birds can survive in this world is a good sign.
[k]

？！

＠Fou
Fou, fooou!
[k]

＠Mash
Fou? Is there something about those birds that bothers you...?

Um, anyway, we should get back to our journey. Fou, you stay inside my shield while we use the Ollerus Boards, okay?

We don't want the wind blowing you away[sr]while we're on the move, after all.

Here's a map of where we would be in Proper Human History. There's definitely some margin of error, since there aren't any GPS satellites to sync it up with, but it should still help...

There we go. We're currently on the Scandinavian Peninsula, right on top of what used to be Lake Vättern in southern Sweden.
[k]

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
...[sr]...
[k]

？2：Hang on. We're on a lake?

[charaFace A 12]

＠Mash
...Yes, that's right.[sr]At least, we would be in Proper Human History...
[k]

？！

[charaFace A 7]

＠Mash
Lake Vättern is an enormous lake believed to have taken shape after Earth's most recent ice age. It's said to be almost two thousand squre kilometers.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Mash
But, in this Lostbelt, we're obviously standing[sr]on a mountain range covered in snow...

I thought I'd learned that in Russia, but after seeing all this, I feel like I'm learning it all over again.
