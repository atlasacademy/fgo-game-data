Still, I couldn't care less about the people here one way or the other, so I'll just let that comment slide!

Now then, getting down to business: if you're about to leave, it's time for you to pay up what you owe.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
This ice castle may be deserted and downright awful to live in, but in this world it's on par with a five-star hotel! Accommodations that luxurious don't come cheap, you know.

＠Koyanskaya
Let's seeeeee... A short stay for three pathetic humans and one ratty little fur ball, that comes to...five quadrillion QP!
[k]

[charaFace D 21]

＠Koyanskaya
But not to worry! If you can't afford to pay in QP or quartz, then I'll happily settle for watching your death agonies instead!
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I did tell you back in Russia[sr]that I'd see you again, didn't I?

That's Koyanskaya, of NFF Services! She's working with the Crypters, and was partially responsible for destroying Chaldea!
