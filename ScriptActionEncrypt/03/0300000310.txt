Very soon, your four-day house arrest will come to an end. The investigation will continue until tomorrow, but you have been cleared of suspicion.

＠Priest
It seems the Mage's Association wishes to have you arrested, but we at the Holy Church feel otherwise.

＠Priest
We see the battles you have fought and the contributions you have made, and recognize them for what they're worth.

My superior, Pontifex Noi,[sr]commended your accomplishments personally.

Leonardo has been hard at work in the Command Room as of last night. The procedure to unthaw Team A has already begun.

＠Priest
Now that the Coffins have been repaired, they were to be thawed by 4:00 p.m. today, so I expect we'll be hearing word of their success any moment now.

Leonardo will be on her way once that is done, but I am willing to at least grant her a last supper.

By all means, enjoy your final meal together this evening.

Well that's a shame. Here we've only just met, and you've already decided you dislike me. Of course, if that's your decision, I will respect it.
