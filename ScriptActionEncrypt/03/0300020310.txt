The Border's spirit radar is one of the most sensitive in the world. If it failed to detect this Servant until now, then they are probably getting some help with their Presence Concealment.

Had they wished to do so, I have no doubt they could have gotten much, much closer.

And yet, they instead chose to release their spirit form right in front of us, making their presence known.

There's a nonzero chance that our armor just comes off in Void Space and we end up adrift there forever.

They should have been as strong as a fortress made of divine iron...yet you cut through them like so much butter, and without even revealing your True Name.
