Needless to say, if we're going to defeat Arjuna, we'll need to reduce his overwhelming power and find a way to draw out more of our own.

And luckily, we now know where[sr]we can probably find them.

Casters, on the other hand, tend to be excellent mages,[sr]but they're certainly not known for their prowess in battle.
[k]

＠Goredolf
Being an excellent mage doesn't automatically make you an excellent warrior, after all.
[k]

＠Goredolf
No, most Casters fight by laying cunning traps and collecting information outside of battle to stack the deck in their favor.
[k]

＠Goredolf
So in a head-to-head brawl, they're likely to fall one step behind compared to an Archer. If we can drag them into such a brawl, we should have a good chance of defeating them.
