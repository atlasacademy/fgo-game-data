You said this world went through wrong reincarnations before, right? So I was just thinking, if there're wrong ones, maybe there're proper ones too...
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Asha
O-oh no, did I surprise you?[sr]Did I say something weird? I'm sorry.

My job is to tell the truth, and the truth is,[sr]we are doing what we must to save the world.

That is a fact, and one we must not forget.[sr]We must not resent it for purely personal reasons.

＠Holmes
Mash, everything you've experienced up to this point, good and bad alike, has helped shape who you are.

Similarly, do keep in mind that everything we've done here is necessary for what we're trying to accomplish.

...Good night.
[k]

＠
My blanket is nice and warm. It still smells of sunlight after being hung up to dry.
[k]

＠
My tummy is nice and full,[sr]thanks to the yummy meal Auntie made.
[k]

＠
When I open my eyes, I can see the beautiful earrings Auntie and Uncle gave me for my birth anniversary lying on my nightstand.
[k]

＠
I'm so happy right now. So happy.
[k]

＠
Although...maybe I don't deserve to be.
[k]

＠
I remember the nice travelers...and what they told me...
[k]

＠
...and it makes my chest go tight.
[k]

＠
I remember how sad and lonely I felt on my birth anniversary...when it felt like someone was missing.
[k]

＠
Now I know there was supposed to[sr]be someone named ■■■■ there.
[k]

＠
If ■■■■ had been there, would my birth anniversary have been more fun? If ■■■■ was here now, would I be even happier?
[k]

＠
Huh...? What was his name again?[sr]Who was I thinking about?
[k]

＠
I know they told me about him, but I already forgot. Even though I really cared, and wanted him to be there...
[k]

＠
Oh, right. I prayed about this before I went to bed.[sr]I'm sure I can still remember that.
[k]

＠
That nice [&man:lady] said that there could be proper[sr]reincarnations from now on.
[k]

＠
So, I'll pray that, in the next reincarnation...or the one after that, or even the one after that...
[k]

＠
...■■■■ will come back to me.
[k]


＠Asha
(Sniffle)[sr]H-huh?
[k]


＠
That's weird. All of a sudden, I can't stop crying.[sr]I don't understand.
[k]

＠
It feels like someone I was close to used to scold me whenever I cried before, so there's no point in crying now. I don't need these tears anymore.
[k]

＠
But, no matter how hard I pray for our god to take my useless tears away, they still keep coming.
[k]

＠
I only just remembered that[sr]the nice [&man:lady] also told me...
[k]

＠
...that god isn't here anymore either.
[k]

＠
Now what do I do?
[k]

＠
Does this mean nobody will hear my bedtime prayers?
[k]

＠
Does this mean they'll never come true?
[k]

＠
That thought makes me even sadder,[sr]and now my tears are coming even faster...
