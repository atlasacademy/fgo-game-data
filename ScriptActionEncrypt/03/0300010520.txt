Well done, Patxi.[sr]You can let the packgolems carry them now.

By the way, Atalante,[sr]there is something I wished to ask you.

If there are any Demonic Beast materials at the rebel army stronghold, I was hoping you could let us have them.

＠Atalante Alter
Of course we have a fair amount stocked up. I will consider rewarding you with them, depending on how well you work.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
...Okay. We're almost at the hidden tunnel.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
We still need to pass through it before we arrive at our stronghold, so I am afraid you will need to bear with us a little longer.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Atalante Alter
What about the cold? I am a Servant, and they are Yaga, so we have no issue handling it, but the same cannot be true of you.

Good.

？1：Thank you for your concern.
？！

[charaFace A 4]

＠Atalante Alter
...It's not that. I just found it strange that you could endure it, as no ordinary humans could survive this cold.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
When you get right down to it, I am but one rather atypical aspect of Atalante, manifesting as a Servant.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
I am afraid I do not have much in the way of common sense.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Atalante Alter
Anyway, the tunnel is crawling with Demonic Beasts,[sr]but they are weak, hiding here for shelter.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
We can simply cut our way through them without issue.

Comms? Is that a method of using magecraft[sr]to see things that are far away?

The tunnel must be affecting it. These comms of yours should be fixed once we get out. Just forget about them in the meantime.

On a different subject, we've seen a lot of Demonic Beasts, but I'm surprised we haven't seen any normal animals yet...

...That certainly makes sense if you think about it. There are simply no ordinary animals that could survive such a harsh environment.
[k]

＠Avicebron
Add an overwhelmingly dominant species to the mix, and it's little wonder the other animals went extinct.
