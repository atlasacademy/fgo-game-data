You got it. Okay, let's start with[sr]a review of our current situation.

＠Da Vinci
First of all, it's been about twenty hours since yesterday's attack. Thanks to all your valiant efforts, we were able to avoid the worst-case scenario...
[k]

[charaFace B 24]

＠Da Vinci
...but I'm afraid we're still[sr]not doing well, all told.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
When Sigurd, whom we believe to be a Lostbelt Servant,[sr]broke into the Shadow Border's cockpit yesterday...

...he made off with our Void-Reality[sr]Observation Device, the Paper Moon.

The lost Norse runes are one of the foundations of magecraft. Mages have partially reproduced them, but they pale in comparison to the original ones from the Age of Gods.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Still, that doesn't mean they're not handy.
[k]

[charaFace B 25]

＠Da Vinci
They can be chanted very quickly, which makes[sr]them very useful in a lot of situations.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
For example, we used a whole bunch of them[sr]for [%1]'s Mystic Codes, like Gandr.

[charaFace B 14]

At any rate, the Primordial Runes are powerful stuff.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
According to Norse myth, Odin made most of the world out of Ymir, with the exception of the runes.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
No, the runes were a different matter: Odin discovered them after offering up his own life. Their shapes contain the depths of the world itself.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I guess you could call them the pathways[sr]to truth that Odin discovered.

＠Da Vinci
You deserve some thanks too, [%1].[sr]I'm sorry you had to try to heal him with your Mystic Codes so many times.

But it was thanks to you that Holmes didn't disappear before I could finish the recovery pod.

[charaFadeout A 0.1]

[charaFace B 24]
[charaFadein B 0.1 1]

＠Da Vinci
An excellent question. As you'll recall, Sigurd didn't come here to kill us; he came to steal the Paper Moon.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Why would he do that if he belonged to this Lostbelt?[sr]Simply put, he wouldn't. Never in a million years.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The only ones who would consider the Paper Moon a threat are the Crypters, especially now that they've lost Russia.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In which case, it makes sense to assume[sr]that he is one of the Crypters' Servants.

[charaFadeout D 0.1]
[wt 0.1]

[charaTalk F]
[charaFace F 1]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]

＠Goredolf
Correct. Once the Crypter realizes the Tree of Emptiness is in danger, we can be certain they will have some sort of response.
[k]

＠Goredolf
And when they do, that will be the perfect chance for us to take the Paper Moon back. Maybe I'm being a little overly optimistic here, but I'd say this plan is absolutely foolproof!

[wait fade]

＠Da Vinci
First things first: [bgm BGM_EVENT_71 0.1 0.7]the Norse mythology[sr]we know from Proper Human History.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Scandinavia used to be home to all sorts of gods, giants, and other Mystics, just like the Age of Gods in other areas.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But then in 1000 B.C., about three thousand years ago,[sr]Mt. Katla erupted...and Ragnarök began.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It brought an end to that entire reality[line 2]essentially Scandinavia's own Age of Gods.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The gods, the giants, even the Phantasmals in the region, along with all their myths and legends, were completely wiped out.
[k]

＠Goredolf
At least, that's the conventional[sr]wisdom in the mage community.
[k]

＠Mash
Ragnarök... The Twilight of the Gods... That was the conflict that brought an end to the gods in Norse mythology, right?
[k]

＠Goredolf
That's right. Loki's mischief eventually begat all sorts of disasters, culminating with Muspel fire giants invading from Muspelheim, the land of flame.
[k]

＠Goredolf
In fact, what most believe to have been an enormous eruption from Mount Katla was actually the fire giants' invasion.
[k]

＠Goredolf
It's said that during Ragnarök, Odin was eaten by Fenrir, the great wolf of ruin, and that many gods died in a fearsome clash with the giants...
[k]

＠Goredolf
...before Surtr, the Fiery King of Giants and ruler of Muspelheim, laid waste to all the land with his flaming sword.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Yup. And once the gods and giants had[sr]vanished from Scandinavia, that was when[line 2]
[k]

＠Mash
The Age of Humanity began... That was when most of the Mystic was lost, and civilization rapidly advanced...
[k]

＠Fou
Fou fo.[sr]Fou fo, fo fou.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Basically, yup.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The idea that the reality texture covering the world disappeared along with Scandinavia's Age of Gods was more of a presumption, courtesy of mages from Proper Human History.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That does differ a bit from regular historical records, though. The oldest known record we have of Mt. Katla erupting goes back to A.D. 930.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
There just aren't any records of what[sr]happened all the way back in 1000 B.C.
[k]

＠Goredolf
That tracks, if the entire texture was wiped out.
[k]

＠Goredolf
Again, conventional wisdom says that we only have bits and pieces left over now because of this entire texture disappearing.
[k]

＠Meunière
You really do love your conventional wisdom,[sr]don't you, Director?
[k]

＠Goredolf
Wh-what's wrong with that!? Many notable authorities support that theory! I'm told it's all but common knowledge in the Clock Tower's Archaeology Department...in the Meluastea faction, to be precise!
[k]

＠Fou
Fo fou, fou.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
When you get right down to it,[sr]there's still a lot we don't know.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
In Proper Human History, we never did get the full picture of the Scandinavian Age of Gods, so all we have are a lot of vague guesses patched together from whatever small remnants we could find.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...But hey, that's pretty much the case everywhere!

[k]

？！

[charaFace B 14]

＠Da Vinci
One of the big questions we need to answer is, when did this Lostbelt diverge from Proper Human History!
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The other is, given the giants we've run into, we can be certain that it is still before the A.D. era, and that Age of Gods-level Mystics still exist, but we don't yet know why that is.
[k]

[charaFace B 24]

Why does this Lostbelt look like this?[sr]What are those flames you saw on the northern mountains?

＠Da Vinci
And based on what we've been able to observe from the Border, why does it look like there aren't any towns or cities, like there were in Proper Human History?

？1：Roger that!

[charaFace F 1]

＠Goredolf
Good. That's what I like to hear.[sr]It really raises my hopes for your performance!
[k]

？2：And once we find it, we have to cut it down...

[charaFace F 1]

＠Goredolf
But of course. If you see an opportunity to chop it down, go right ahead. No need to wait for my orders in that case.

？1：Because the Border doesn't have enough power...?
？2：Because there aren't any leylines nearby or something?

？！

[charaFace B 25]

＠Da Vinci
Mmm... The Border is running way low on power thanks to all the damage, but the biggest issue is the fact that we couldn't detect any leylines.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I bet it's because of all the magical energy intertwined with the ice and snow at a molecular level. I'm afraid it's also going to interfere with our long-range comms.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Alternatively, the ice and snow's magical energy could be completely controlling both this Lostbelt's mana and history.

It'd mean they're incredibly powerful. If we wanna keep hypothesizing, I'd guess that if someone like that exists, they're also this Lostbelt's king.

＠Da Vinci
Of course, it's possible this is just what this Lostbelt is like, but let's at least keep that possibility in mind.

In short, our situation is highly precarious. We have no choice but to send a mere two-person team to explore further, despite the fact that we currently have no means of defending ourselves.

＠Goredolf
I hope you can appreciate how difficult[sr]of a decision this was to reach.
[k]

？1：All clear here.

While we're on the subject,[sr]let's talk about your current destination, too.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Though we don't know where Sigurd went after stealing the Paper Moon, we did detect a group of life-forms approximately one hundred and fifty kilometers northwest from the Border's current location.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
I'm hoping it's a village, even though[sr]there wasn't one there on the 2019 map...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Aaanyway, I think that'd be a good place to start asking around. I'll make sure to prepare some translation talismans before you leave, of course.

[k]

＠Da Vinci
But this is the best we can do right now.[sr]I'm sorry.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
The Shadow Border still needs a lot of repair work to get it mobile again, and of course, Zero Sailing is currently out of the question.

Still, at least you won't have to worry about the Ortinax. I spent the last twenty hours going over the whole thing with a fine-tooth comb.

You shouldn't have to worry about it acting up after getting hit with a demonic sword anymore.

...For this mission,[sr]you two have three primary objectives.

＠Da Vinci
First, take back the Paper Moon.[sr]Second, cut down the Tree of Emptiness.

＠Da Vinci
And third, find a path to the North Sea. Of course, those last two are more for extra credit, but the first one is absolutely crucial!
