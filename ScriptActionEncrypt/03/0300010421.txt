If you truly had been sent by Ivan the Terrible,[sr]we would clearly have no chance of victory.

That is hard to answer. I am afraid I am not at all familiar with the no doubt myriad extenuating circumstances surrounding this particular conflict.

＠Avicebron
What I can say with confidence is that, compared Russia as we know it, Ivan the Terrible seems to be a most tyrannical leader indeed.

And as such, I believe that in standing up to him,[sr]you are doing exactly what a Heroic Spirit should.
