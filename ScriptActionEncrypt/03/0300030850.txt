Um... The Ortinax's sensors are picking up an impossible amount of magical energy up ahead...

？1：Don't tell me it's a D'yavol Tron?
？2：Don't tell me it's a fire giant?
？！

No. Far stronger. And unless my instruments[sr]are completely broken...there are two of them.

＠Mash
I'm not sure. Their Spirit Origin patterns tell me they must be Demonic Beasts.
[k]

＠Mash
What's more, they're almost identical to the data for the D'yavol Trons and fire giants we've fought before.
[k]

[charaFace C 12]

＠Mash
But the sheer amount of magical energy they possess is insane...and on top of that, the reading is still going up.

...Just so I am certain I understand, Ms. Kyrielight, you said the Ortinax's sensors picked up two signals?

Yes, that's right.

[charaFace A 6]

Hmm... If there are only two,[sr]then where did all the other Demonic Beasts go?

The D'yavol Tron is eating the Krichat',[sr]and the Muspel is eating the other giants...
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Holmes
There is ample precedent for cannibalism in the natural world, but we certainly never saw this happening in either Russia or Scandinavia.
[k]

＠Holmes
Furthermore, if this is the source of the increased magical energy you noticed, then these are no ordinary predators.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Holmes
To gain the strength of those they consume this quickly, they would have to be Soul Eaters.
[k]

＠Mash
Then, they had the ones we were[sr]fighting retreat so that[line 2]
[k]

＠Holmes
Yes. Most likely, it was to make these[sr]two more powerful for the final battle.
[k]

＠Holmes
Though it remains unclear whether these two gave the order to retreat themselves, or if those who retreated did so of their own accord...

I thought so too, Master.[sr]These Demonic Beasts must really hate humans.

＠Mash
...I'm not sure about the significance of that,[sr]but we can worry about it later.

[charaFace C 2]

＠Mash
Right now, it's time to get rid of these Demonic Beasts once and for all! Your orders please, Master!
