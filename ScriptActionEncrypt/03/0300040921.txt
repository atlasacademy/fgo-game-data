...Yes, I do. I'm not so foolish as to insist otherwise at this point. I see now that I was gravely mistaken.

[charaFace I 0]

＠???
No one who would fight against the sacred beasts could possibly be allies of the false god.

[charaFace I 4]

＠???
I am truly, sincerely sorry,[sr]and I thank you for your assistance.

＠???
Please, tell me why you have come here. No, on second thought, it's only right that I tell you about myself first.

Yes, you have a point. All right then, let me first ask you this: Are you a Divine Spirit?

＠???
Yes and no. I am a Servant, but right now, a goddess resides within my body, sharing her power with me.
[k]

＠???
When I was first summoned to this land,[sr]she was already there inside me.

＠Da Vinci
Hmm. There've been plenty of cases where a Divine Spirit would inhabit a person from the past to become a Servant...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And since Heroic Spirit Servants are technically people from the past, I guess it makes sense that a Divine Spirit could inhabit one of them, too.
[k]

[charaFace E 8]

＠Da Vinci
Though I definitely haven't heard of many cases where it happened quite like this.

＠???
I expect it's because this god and I happen to share the same name.
[k]

＠???
I believe having words, sounds, and names match is very significant when it comes to magecraft.
[k]

[charaFace I 3]

＠???
Then again, I was originally given this name in the hope of receiving her blessing, so perhaps it isn't much of a coincidence after all...

...Lakshmi.

＠???
And I am the Rani of Jhansi, a land which once existed in India, who was named for her...
[k]

＠???
My name is Lakshmi Bai.
