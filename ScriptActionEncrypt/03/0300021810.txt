＠Scáthach-Skadi
Three thousand years, and still I remain powerless to support more villages beyond those created in that first six months...
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
All this time, and I have still only saved a hundred villages, a mere ten thousand humans!
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
I cannot even let any of them live to old age!
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
For my love and snow can only extend my Authority to the point before the first signs of spring arrive!

＠Scáthach-Skadi
No doubt this pathetic state of affairs will continue for thousands upon thousands of years.

＠Scáthach-Skadi
For three millennia, I have devoted[sr]my power to suppressing Surtr's fires!
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
But now! Now that Surtr is[sr]gone from this Lostbelt...
