Yes, it was no problem. I don't think the Ortinax has ever been in better shape.

＠Mash
It's so much more stable now than it was before we came to the Wandering Sea.

＠Mash
Not only does it have properly outfitted equipment now, but having both Da Vinci and Sion fine-tune it is like...

I-I knew it! I thought it sounded strange as soon as the words left my mouth.

Kintoki's the one who taught me that expression, but I think something might have gotten lost in translation...

I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with Japanese sayings either. I was speaking about our enemies.

They are indeed all gone, but there is still something else here... Something whose intentions I cannot discern.

...a human with a sublimely beautiful body.
[k]

＠
A body with perfect symmetry, as if it were the epitome of genderless beauty.
[k]

＠
Their lips curved in an indomitable,[sr]but amicable smile.
[k]

＠
Even after Karna's spear sailed past them...
[k]

＠
...grazing their side and obliterating a boulder with sufficient force to impale a hundred frail-bodied humans...
[k]

＠
...they were smiling.
[k]

＠
They were smiling with the same casual ease as a person enjoying a gentle breeze at an outdoor café...
[k]

＠
...their face betraying not so[sr]much as a hint of fear or panic.
[k]

＠
It was as though they had not just had not a care in the world, even after being millimeters from death.

Were you a normal human, I would indeed be deeply ashamed, but I sensed such an attack would not nearly be enough to end you.

Now that I have seen you for myself,[sr]I am even more confident in that assertion.

I thought I'd hidden myself pretty well, so imagine my surprise when that spear went whizzing past me.

Oh well... That's what I get for not being more careful about investigating strange noises.
