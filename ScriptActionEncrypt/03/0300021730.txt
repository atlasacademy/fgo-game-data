You need not concern yourselves with us. I'm sorry for dragging you into this, Brynhild my love.

Not at all, Sigurd.[sr]I only did what I was always meant to do.

I am overjoyed. Never could I have imagined an opportunity to wield my spear at your side.

The most powerful ability given to the Crypters.[sr]It is their trump card.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
But the cost of using it...is their life.

＠Scáthach-Skadi
And there is nothing that can be[sr]done to avoid paying that price.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
It matters not how many salves or medicines are administered, or how effective a Mystic Code may be at healing.
[k]

＠Scáthach-Skadi
Not even the Primordial Runes can help. If one makes full, unadulterated use of their power, as Brynhild did, it may be possible to gain a reprieve...

...but even that could buy her no[sr]more than a few minutes at best.

It was all thanks...to you...

You're amazing, Mash.[sr]You actually defeated that thing.

I guess I can't blame Kadoc for losing to you anymore.[sr]Neither of us ever...

I wish...I could see you grow even more...

But, I can't.[sr]I'm sorry, Mash.

I can't betray Lord Kirschtaria.[sr]And, I don't want to.

That's all[line 2]

Hey, Mash?[sr]You know what?

I...I may not compare to...Brynhild,[sr]and her love for Sigurd...

...but...for me, and Lord Kirschtaria...

＠Mash
...I know.

＠Mash
I admit I'm not familiar with...exactly what it is,[sr]but whenever you stare at him...

Then I guess mages do fall in love, too.[sr]And there's nothing wrong with that.

＠Mash
At least, that's what I think.

＠Ophelia
I see...
[k]

＠Ophelia
Yes, you may be right. I guess...you see a lot more than I ever did, Mash...
[k]

＠Ophelia
...You've grown up so beautifully.[sr]...I'm so happy to see that.
[k]

＠Ophelia
Seeing you trapped in Chaldea, looking out the window at the icy wasteland...it was like looking at myself.
[k]

＠Ophelia
...Though of course, I doubt you're pleased by the comparison to me back when I lived in fear...

I'm sure we'll find a way to protect humanity,[sr]to survive, and...

...to save the world...

＠Ophelia
Yes.

＠Ophelia
You all just might be able to do that.
