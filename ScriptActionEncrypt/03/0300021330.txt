＠Da Vinci
There, I can see it![sr]Hmm, so that's Scáthach-Skadi's castle.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It doesn't look very heavily armed. In fact, it reminds me of something out of modern-day European architecture.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Maybe that's just how confident she is in her rule?[sr]Or maybe because there's no rebellion here anyway?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Either way, there's a hell of a lot more magical energy swirling around here than there was on the snow plains. That's going to make it a lot harder to tell what's going on in there.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
At least the structure's easy to make out:[sr]one large bridge leading to the main building.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We could theoretically go all the way around and climb up from the base, buuut, we don't have any information to help us with that tactic.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Which means this is it, folks![sr]This is where our mission really begins!

No turning back now! This time, I'm not planning on sneaking in OR getting captured.

This time, we're going in guns blazing! It's time to settle the score between the new Grande Armée and the wielder of that demonic sword once and for all!

Whoa, thanks, but no thanks. You just stay back and keep yourself warmed up for now. Can't have you getting worn out in the opening skirmish!

That sound good to you too, Private!?

？1：You bet!

？！

[charaFace A 6]

Haha! You're the focal point of this new Scandinavian Grande Armée! Better get used to it now!
