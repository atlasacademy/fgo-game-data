...I see. After my quick thinking let me escape from the Command Room before anyone else...

No, Mr. Goredolf, the Oprichniki didn't capture her.[sr]She's the one leading them!

I don't know why she did it, but I think she's[sr]the one who orchestrated this attack on Chaldea!

That she only traveled far and wide and worked herself to the bone so I could land Chaldea for HER sake instead of mine!?

＠Koyanskaya
Oh my, I think we have a misunderstanding,[sr]Your Excellency.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
We recommended Chaldea to you as a purchase with tremendous value. We were completely honest about that.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
You saw its value, accepted the offered price, and invested your personal fortune. We assassinated your rival bidders to guarantee your purchase.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
As a result, you gained sole rights over Chaldea and its property, and we were able to complete our objective without the Association interfering.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
That sounds like a win-win to me.[sr]But then you go and call me a minx...?
[k]

[charaFace C 16]

＠Koyanskaya
I'm normally very gentle,[sr]but that really ruffles my feathers.

So now we're going to kill you all. It's time for all of you to pay up for everything you're worth♡

[charaFace C 16]

＠Koyanskaya
But don't worry your pretty little head, mmkay?[sr]I couldn't care less about other Servants, so I'll make sure to kill you quickly.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
The only prey I really like to take my time with is of the human variety. The ones I'm really fond of, I like to stuff and mount on my walls.
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
In fact, I've got quite a nice collection now, if I do say so myself. You know how some people like to hunt foxes? It's just like that, only with humans.
[k]

[charaFace C 17]

＠Koyanskaya
Goredolf isn't worth my time, but you just barely make the grade, [%1].
[k]

＠Koyanskaya
I think you'd look wonderful on my mantle.[sr]Oh, but I will have to remove those unsightly limbs first.

She IS a Servant.[sr]And not the kind we know, either.
