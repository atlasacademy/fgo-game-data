Ah yes, Akuta and that fox woman told us some nonsense about Lostbelts and Pruning Theoretical Phenomena.

＠???
If you insist upon feeding us the same lies,[sr]we may lose our temper.

We will make our own judgments once we[sr]have seen past the storm wall for ourself.

May I ask you something, Your Imperial Majesty?

Did a strange tree happen to appear in this land around the same time as the storm? Specifically, a tree of light so large it reaches up to the sky?

Hmm. We see you are still hiding[sr]something from us, Akuta.
[k]

＠???
Well, no matter. We are well aware she has some cards yet to play. No doubt they have something to do with her differences with you.
[k]

＠???
Our interest, though, lies solely in maintaining[sr]peace in our empire and reclaiming its territories.
[k]

＠???
We have no intention of becoming involved in disputes between visitors, unless those disputes become something that affect us.
[k]

＠???
Now then, let us be candid.[sr]You inquired about a tree of light?
[k]

＠???
The answer is no. Our sight extends to all of China, and we have observed nothing of the sort.

Are you sure you don't mind speaking with[sr]us directly like this, Your Imperial Majesty?

Well, most people in positions like yours like to,[sr]you know, dress up their negotiations a bit, right?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They like to trot out intermediaries and representatives and the like. Usually they make a point never to meet face-to-face.
[k]

[charaFace A 17]
＠Da Vinci
I mean, drawing a firm line between themselves and the lesser people by refusing to speak to them directly is a big part of how nobles like to demonstrate their difference in status, right?

Hehe, hahaha. What a strange[sr]thing to say at this point.
[k]

＠???
We see. In your world, monarchs are so insecure that they refuse even to permit themselves to be seen for fear of seeming less than perfect.
[k]

＠???
Tell us, does the sun seek to hide from the public eye? Does the moon hide itself from the people's gaze?
[k]

＠???
We are the Emperor, the Child of Heaven.[sr]The celestial existence who reigns over all our citizens.
[k]

＠???
That is why we permit them audience.
[k]

＠???
Just as the sun's light bathes every corner of Earth, so too does our glory shine upon every person on this world who looks up to us.
[k]

＠???
Still, we suppose that if the sun looked the same as anyone else, it may feel a need to put on a bit of a show to emphasize its power and status.
