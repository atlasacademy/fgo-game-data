＠Da Vinci
Now then, [bgm BGM_EVENT_81 0.1]there are basically three[sr]different kinds of beings here.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And by “beings,” it's worth noting that I'm talking about strong, dominant creatures, not necessarily those of intelligence who have formed civilizations.
[k]

[charaFace C 24]

＠Da Vinci
All right, so.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
First, we have the giants: tough, exceedingly strong predators. Second, we have humans, who can't survive outside their villages.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And third, we have envoys and their goddess. Seems safe to say both are well above humans on the proverbial totem pole in this Lostbelt.
[k]

[charaFace C 25]

＠Da Vinci
I'm sure the ice beasts are stronger than humans too, but they appear to be the giants' pets, and seem to have no real will of their own, so I've left them out.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So far so good?
[k]

[charaFace C 24]

＠Da Vinci
As for regular creatures,[sr]they seem to be almost nonexistent here.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Ordinary plants and animals just barely exist in the occasional flower garden... Each of these fields seems to be a warm place that just happened to be perfectly situated between the fire and ice zones.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
So, putting all that aside as an exception[sr]to the three broad categories...

I mean, you haven't seen a single machine since you got there, right? And that girl you ran into out in the wilderness didn't even have a communication device, let alone a ward against giants.

We still don't know much about these envoys and their goddess, who I assume are more or less running the show here.

Still, everything you said sounds lovely. Getting to be an elderly person, doing anything you want...

I may not have understood everything you meant...but[sr]I did think it sounded absolutely amazing.

＠Gerda
It was just so... I can't even begin to imagine[sr]it all! That's never happened to me before.

There's still so much I don't know about children, but you said in your world, there are also grandchildren, and...great-grandchildren?

＠Gerda
I can't imagine getting to see so many generations of children... I guess that's something you can do if you get to be elderly.
