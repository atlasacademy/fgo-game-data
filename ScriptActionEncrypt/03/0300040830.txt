I'm sure it's been some time since a calendar meant anything in this world, but for the purposes of our discussion, let's say the year here is 2021.

＠Holmes
As I'm sure you're aware from visiting the nearby town, civilization here has not advanced anything like as far as in Proper Human History.
[k]

[charaFace B 3]

That is not to say I only value postindustrial age advances, or that I have no appreciation for a life lived in harmony with nature. I assure you, neither is true.

＠Holmes
I am merely saying that civilization as a whole has clearly not progressed here when compared to Proper Human History.
[k]

＠Holmes
That aspect alone is enough for me to declare this world a far cry from anything approaching the ideal.
[k]

＠Holmes
The march of civilization has stalled here just like in the Chinese Lostbelt, albeit for very different reasons.

“Thawing the Coffins” might not sound like a big deal, but it's basically like recovering dead bodies.

We were all dead in there.[sr]We were never going to wake up from that darkness.

But then, the Foreign God came and told us:

“You may live on as a Crypter, or die as a Master.”

Maybe using the word “god” isn't the best way to go about it. It might be better to take a different approach.

＠Peperoncino
We're looking for someone who is very much out of place in this world... In other words, someone who finds this place as wrong as we do.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
If someone like that exists, they'd probably be out fighting kali regardless of what yuga it is.

＠Prakash
Well, I wouldn't call them bad, exactly. Everything alive in this world is the god's creation, after all.
[k]

＠Prakash
But I would say they're just a bit too focused on the wrong things, unfortunately.
[k]

[charaFace I 4]

＠Prakash
Nonetheless, yes, I have heard there are people like that in the village on the other side of the mountain.
[k]

＠Prakash
I'm told they spend most of their time taking up weapons and fighting the kali, in defiance of the god's teachings.
[k]

＠Prakash
They certainly do things differently than we do in Bichu, where we accept god's trials with piety and grace...
[k]

＠Prakash
...but I suppose that is just the way they choose to live their lives.

Sounds good to me, but just be aware that you might not be able to get there by nightfall.

I think it's better if we don't move around too much in the middle of the night, so if you find a good place to make camp, don't be shy about doing just that. Okay?
