＠???
I am...and now I have seen your power for myself.[sr]You say you are here to join the rebel army?
[k]

？1：Yes, that's right.

＠???
I see. But I cannot trust you.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠???
You all look like humans.
[k]

？2：If it's okay with you.

[charaFace C 5]

＠???
Of course.[sr]I would be glad to welcome you...were you not human.
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 4]

＠???
In this world, there are only two kinds of people[sr]who look like humans: mages and Servants.
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠???
And that means you are our enemy.

Are you with the Tsar, or are you not?

The answer to that lies in whether[sr]you are merciful as well as strong.

...And so I shall make you a grossly unfair proposal: fight us without killing us, even as we do our best to kill you.

If you have strength enough to kill us all, then you are no spy. There would be no point in spying on us if you could simply kill us at your leisure, after all.
[k]

＠???
But, if you are strong enough to kill[sr]us AND choose to spare our lives...
[k]

[charaFace C 2]

＠???
...that would prove you are merciful, and that is a kindness only humans possess. That is my offer.[sr]You may take it or leave it!

Well, Master, now what would you have us do?[sr]I will abide by whatever you decide.
[k]

？1：We're going to do exactly what she says.

＠Avicebron
Understood.
[k]

？2：We're going to fight, and we're going to win.[csr]Without killing them.

＠Avicebron
As you wish.
[k]

＠Avicebron
This will certainly be difficult, but not impossible.
[k]

＠Avicebron
Very well then, let us show her exactly[sr]why we were chosen as Heroic Spirits.

？！
