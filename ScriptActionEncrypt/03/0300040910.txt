Besides, the more commotion we make, the more likely we are to be captured by the Lōkapāla we've been hearing rumors about.

＠???
The Lōkapāla are said to serve god directly, and have incredible power in their own right. The moment they find us, it's over. We can't let that happen.

＠???
I could manage on my own if it came to that, but if you or the village caught their eye, it would be disastrous.
