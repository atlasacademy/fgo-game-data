...And that absurd reasoning has[sr]you drinking poison from a chalice?
[k]

＠Man
So you think it's foolish too, huh.[sr]My wife said the same thing.
[k]

＠Man
His Imperial Majesty himself gave me this poison. All I need do is drain it in a single gulp, and I will displease him no more.
[k]

＠Man
I have slain too many for one in my position.[sr]You might say I've outlived my usefulness.
[k]

＠Woman
I don't understand. None of this would have happened if not for how petty the emperor is. How can you be willing to lay down your life for a man like that?
[k]

＠Man
You may not see any sense in it, but this is simply what it means to be a warrior.
[k]

＠Woman
...Once I heard you were going to die,[sr]I had to come and ask.
[k]

＠Woman
Say the word, and I will see everyone who toyed with your destiny...who forced this hollow loyalty upon you...drown in a sea of their own blood.

Haha... I'm honored you are so angry on my behalf.

...I don't understand. The way you talk of life and death makes no sense whatsoever.
[k]

＠Woman
But then, I suppose I could never understand, as death is a concept that's never had meaning to me.
[k]

＠Man
Ah yes, that's true, isn't it. Perhaps, if anything,[sr]I should be the one begging you for forgiveness.
[k]

＠Man
After all...the peace I will attain in[sr]death will be forever beyond your reach.
[k]

＠Woman
Perhaps I'm jealous. Jealous of your death, and of the brilliance of your life leading up to it.
[k]

＠Man
You are too kind. I assure you,[sr]I know no more of death's secrets than you do.
[k]

＠Man
Even should I learn them now,[sr]they will soon be lost to darkness.
[k]

＠Woman
...Do you have any last wishes?
[k]

＠Man
...Good question. If I could wish for something beyond my own death...it would be to someday see you again.
[k]

＠Man
...Haha, I suppose such a wish[sr]must sound completely absurd.
[k]

＠Woman
Not necessarily. I have seen the likes[sr]of you shatter more daunting barriers.
[k]

＠Woman
I have seen them tame lightning, cure plagues,[sr]and even change the course of rivers.
[k]

＠Woman
...I cannot say how long it will take, but...
[k]

＠Woman
...eventually, the day may come when those bound[sr]by mortal lives learn to reach beyond even death.

Should such a day come to pass, and if I am lucky enough to be there to see it...then I shall recall your final wish.
