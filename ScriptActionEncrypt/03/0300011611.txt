I do.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
There is a ravine right at the midpoint[sr]between here and the capital.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
It is protected by a large forest inhabited by vicious Demonic Beasts, which would make it difficult for the Oprichniki from the capital to attack it.

＠Atalante Alter
Whereas there are no mountains between[sr]here and the ravine to block OUR path.
[k]

＠Holmes
I see.
[k]

[charaFace E 6]

＠Holmes
But in that case, wouldn't its natural defenses also make it difficult for you to attack the capital?
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
Yes, I have considered that, which is why I have not moved there thus far...but now, scouts have discovered a tunnel that safely cuts through the woods.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
At the moment, this tunnel is still[sr]only partially hollowed out.
[k]

＠Atalante Alter
But once it is complete, we could reach Yaga Moscow in a single day. It would let us attack it with the element of surprise.
[k]
