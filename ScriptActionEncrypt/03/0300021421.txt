The Ortinax is designed to be fire-resistant. It should be able to hold up in the face of extreme heat from the natural world.

But it was never designed to withstand being submerged in lava. You're lucky you're still standing.

Be wary of his Noble Phantasm! Surtr's flaming[sr]sword is a Divine Construct born from a planet!

Hey, Surtr! I figured a god killer would be way more impressive, but so far, you've been a big letdown.

No, it's not just light. It's heat...flickering heat that reduces everything it touches to ash.
