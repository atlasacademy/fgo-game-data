That's right. This is where Chaldea stores various kinds of equipment, and disposes of materials it no longer needs...

Let's go inside, [%1].
[k]

＠Da Vinci
That container is made of a special, highly durable material. It'd take a tank shell to even dent it.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
What's more, we set it up on some rails that'll eject it from the hangar in the worst case scenario.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It might be a bumpy ride, since we'll have to make the trip by sledding all the way down the mountain, but at least we should be able to make it to the bottom.

One girl froze the entire east hall single-handedly.[sr]Hard as it is to believe, she's a Servant.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She must be a Heroic Spirit who[sr]was summoned outside of Chaldea.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
She headed to the Command Room after freezing the east hall, so that might be frozen solid by now too.

＠Da Vinci
They caught us completely by surprise.[sr]We have nothing at all to go on at the moment.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Which is yet another reason why we should beat a temporary retreat. We can call the Mage's Association for help, gather intel on who we're up against, and[line 2]
