Mon plaisir, mademoiselle. The stars and the aurora made it real easy to pass the time. Besides, gotta use the right tool for the job. Since we Heroic Spirits don't need to sleep, I was obviously the best choice.
[k]

＠Napoleon
We don't need to eat either, of course...but we can still enjoy a good meal.
[k]

[charaFace C 11]

＠Napoleon
Gotta say, these rations you brought with you are impressive. I had no idea we'd come so far with how we made and preserved food.
[k]

[charaFace C 10]

＠Napoleon
If only my Grande Armée had had that kind of food... The best we could come up with was bottled goods, and trust me, those weren't much help in Russia.
[k]

＠Napoleon
I wish I'd been able to mass-produce canned goods, things might've turned out differently...

Not exactly. Someone else came up with the idea,[sr]but it was Napoleon who inspired them to do so.
[k]

＠Mash
Since Napoleon's Grande Armée went on so many expeditions, it was essential they find some way to improve the quality of their rations.

Set up a contest with a prize of twelve thousand francs for whoever could come up with the best new kind of ration!
[k]

＠Napoleon
A confectioner by the name of Nicolas Appert succeeded brilliantly. He came up with the airtight container and the idea to sterilize them with heat!
[k]

？2：...You offered twelve thousand francs to anyone who could make better rations, right?

[charaFace C 6]

＠Napoleon
You really know your stuff, Private! That's right. I held a contest to see who could come up with the best way to improve our rations!
[k]

＠Napoleon
A confectioner by the name of Nicolas Appert ended up winning. He came up with the airtight container and the idea to sterilize them with heat!
[k]

？！

[charaFace C 10]

＠Napoleon
Of course, since we used glass bottles, they ended up breaking all the time, which was a real mess in more ways than one...

[charaFace C 10]

＠Napoleon
Canned goods and those things you call vacuum packs all originate from Appert's work with bottles.
[k]

＠Napoleon
That goes for Chaldea's rations, too.

According to the data Illya sent me, this third goddess should be imprisoned in the mountain's peak.

On a map from Proper Human History, it would be located on the old Jötunheimen highlands, but[line 2]
