It's highly poisonous. I've only done a quick scan so far, but I can already tell it's strong enough to easily melt through steel, a human body, or even a spiritual body.

While the Border is sealed tightly enough that we could theoretically attempt to barrel through it...

I'm a Phantom Spirit, not a typical Servant.[sr]My entire reason for being is my love of the sea.
