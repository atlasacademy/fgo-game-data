I don't know anything about this Crypter stuff,[sr]but whatever they are, that one was still my Master.
[k]

＠
Once he ordered me to leave Arjuna alone,[sr]I was able to hold back my urge to kill him.
[k]

＠
But...once my Master was no longer my Master...
[k]

＠
Once Arjuna slapped that curse on me like he was putting a collar on a stray dog, and then told me he was my new Master...
[k]

＠
There was no way in hell I was going to take that.

＠
I tried to kill him immediately after he cursed me.
[k]

＠
I tried to kill him in the span of a single breath...[sr]In the blink of a goddamn eye.

I might've lost the bond with my true Master,[sr]and been forced to submit to my most hated enemy...
