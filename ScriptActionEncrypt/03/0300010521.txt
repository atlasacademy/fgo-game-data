It seems we find ourselves in possession of an unexpectedly large quantity of meat. Everyone, take as much as you can carry.

I think I'll take some of this earth while I'm at it.[sr]This cave is rather a lucky find.

All the Demonic Beasts that inhabit it must[sr]have affected the earth's properties.

I know we call ourselves the rebel army, but there's a lot of Yaga who came here with their families after having their villages razed 'cause they had nowhere else to go.

That's right. Hell, that's how most[sr]of us rebel soldiers ended up joining.

I'm one of the lucky ones. My whole family made it out alive. Some of the kids here saw their parents murdered right in front of them.

Master, myself, Avicebron, and Patxi are all currently accompanying the rebel army. We're just outside their hideout right now.

＠Mash
We'll use this opportunity to regroup, and to see if we can acquire the parts we need to repair the Border.

We'll also see if we can replenish our food[sr]stores, too. Assuming that's possible, anyway...

A hidden stronghold, huh? I'm not super familiar with fortress engineering, but I have to say that they seem to have done a good job with this one.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's surrounded by cliffs, making it impossible to invade from the flank or rear, and its gates are equipped with ballistae to handle frontal assaults.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
They've even got a barricade in place to[sr]defend against the Oprichniki's cavalry.
[k]

[charaFace G 19]
＠Da Vinci
There's no way any enemies could take this place down without significant casualties. I guess they don't call themselves the rebel “army” for nothing.
