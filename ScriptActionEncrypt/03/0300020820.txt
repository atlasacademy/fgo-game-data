＠???
..Well, well. We don't see your[sr]kind tumbling down here every day.
[k]

＠???
You definitely didn't come down here of your own accord.[sr]You clearly fell down.
[k]

＠???
Haha, they must have taken advantage[sr]of a flaw in your temporary contract.
[k]

＠???
They were able to forge a connection with you with no problem, but you must have fallen down here when you weren't able to make it to the dream.

＠???
...Heh. I suppose this, too, is fate.
[k]

？1：You are...

＠???
Don't push yourself too hard.[sr]That's it. You don't know me.
[k]

＠???
There you go. Just forget about it. Regrets and voids that gnaw away at people in their dreams are MY quarry. No one else's.
[k]

？2：I don't know where, but I've heard your voice before.

＠???
...You're pretty sharp, aren't you?
[k]

＠???
But no, there's no way you know me.[sr]And no need for you to.
[k]

＠???
Regrets and voids that gnaw away at people in their dreams are MY quarry. No one else's. Factual records of me shouldn't exist.

＠???
...Now then, if we're going to send you back the way you came...we'll have to start by burning these things away.
[k]


＠???
It'd help if you could form your sense of self soon,[sr]but that might be asking a bit too much.
[k]

＠???
Stand back.
[k]

？1：Hang on.
？2：I'm still lost, but if it's dangerous, I'll fight too.

？！

＠???
...Hmph.
