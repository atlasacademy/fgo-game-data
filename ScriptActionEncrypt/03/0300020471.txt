But it's not MY fault; it's this castle. Just when I thought I'd get a reprieve from Russia's cold, too...

[charaFace G 20]

＠Koyanskaya
I mean, a palace made entirely of solid ice? Talk about overwrought. They even say it's cold enough that I'd frost over without a Mystic Code.

I do prefer the cold to heat, but this is overkill![sr]Don't you agree, darling Ophelia?

The Tree of Emptiness is coming along nicely,[sr]and this Lostbelt's king has been very cooperative.

Now that I've made some nice additions to my personal collection, I'll be moving on to the next Lostbelt soon.

I'll never waver, nor will I fall for anyone's deception. My Mystic Code has a talisman designed explicitly to protect my mind.
