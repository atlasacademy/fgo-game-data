Behold these stairs that link us to the skies! This texture that transforms everything into its rightful form!

＠Limbo
This Lostbelt may be yet another frail bastion for humanity, but its way of life is completely unique!
[k]

＠Limbo
In place of a future that expands ever outward, it has elected a future that narrows infinitely inward!
[k]

＠Limbo
Indeed, that is the one good thing about this Lostbelt! It will reach its end goal quicker that way.

Turn, turn, turn! Every time the cycle turns, more is shaved off! Now, its destruction reaches a fever pitch!

The roots of cosmic fantasy have descended upon us, and the Tree of Ideology has died! Hear me, foundation of a new world, and bloom!

Your name is Tree of Emptiness Spiral! You are the many finite boundaries that surround this planet!

This change in color... It seems to be like what we saw in China, only taken even further...?
[k]

＠Holmes
I don't know what this new black color means, but I believe the tree's structure remains identical to the one in China.
[k]

＠Holmes
That is to say, the Tree of Emptiness contained its own pocket dimension. Now, the Tree has opened up, exposing the galaxy inside.
[k]

＠Holmes
There's no time to analyze it further,[sr]and as of yet, no telling what it means.
[k]

＠Holmes
All I can say for certain at this point...is that a tremendous amount of magical energy is flowing from it and into Arjuna!
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Holmes
(Orochi. Sombrero. Mayall. And now, Spiral. As I suspected, they're all names of different galaxies.)
[k]

[charaFace F 5]

＠Holmes
(They must be weapons of invasion from other celestial bodies. But why invade like this?)
[k]

＠Holmes
(With that much sheer magical energy, they could just as easily incinerate the Earth's surface, as Goetia did.)
[k]

＠Holmes
(So why would our enemies go out of their way to model the trees after galaxies? Are they truly weapons of invasion?)

It doesn't matter how much power you take in from elsewhere, Arjuna. This changes nothing.

...Oh, right. I have been told that I have a tendency to say too little rather than too much, so let me be abundantly clear about this.

[bgm BGM_EVENT_91 0.1 0.3]

＠Karna
If the dark Krishna inside you truly has become who you are now...
[k]

＠Karna
...then you yourself have become something you saw as defective, and you just haven't realized it yet.
[k]

＠Karna
Though, honestly, I never saw you as defective at all.
[k]

[charaFace A 4]

＠Karna
So let me ask you: What are your own deficiencies?[sr]What is your own evil?
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Karna
Have you ever looked at yourself, and admitted that you might also have faults?
[k]

＠Karna
The Arjuna I know was no god, but he knew the value of taking a good, long look at himself.
