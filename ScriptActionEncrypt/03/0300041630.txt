Part of it is because she's only a source of power now, and part of it is because they are sisters.

Okay, in light of all that's happened, we need to figure out a new plan, starting with where our old one went wrong.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's obvious now that we were severely underestimating the extent of Arjuna's ability to erase things he considers defective whenever he remakes the world.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Hard as it might be to believe, we know now he can get rid of entire communities if he wants to.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Maybe he came up with some way to simplify it, like assuming anyone who takes up arms against the kali is defective.
[k]

[charaFace E 4]

＠Da Vinci
But either way, now that we know he's capable of mass removals like this...
[k]

＠Da Vinci
...we should probably assume that the more people stand out, the more likely they are to be erased.
