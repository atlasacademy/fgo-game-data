I guess there's only so much we can do, even if it's just to buy time. We're all doing our best, but there's just not enough of us.

Obviously, we can't increase our numbers or anything, but we might still be able to pull this off if we change how we go about it a little.

Um, if you're talking about psyching ourselves up and giving it one-hundred and twenty percent, I don't think that's going to help!

？！

＠B：Peperoncino
No, I don't mean that. See, there's someone here who's still trying to play it cool, even in this situation.
[k]

＠B：Peperoncino
A real dummy who has yet to put[sr]all their cards on the table.

I wasn't planning to do this in front[sr]of you and Mashie, [%1].
[k]

＠B：Peperoncino
Maybe that's because I'm still technically your prisoner, and I thought it'd be better if I didn't do anything that'd make you more suspicious of me.
[k]

＠B：Peperoncino
But now that I think about it, I don't really mind if you know. And if it'll mean we make it out of here alive, I don't see any reason to hesitate.

These things might not be ordinary creatures, but it's not like they keep their brains in their stomachs or have organs made of diamond, right?
[k]

＠B：Peperoncino
As long as their bodies follow mostly the same rules as ours, I can apply the knowledge I already have and probably manage somehow.
[k]

[charaFace B 8]

＠B：Peperoncino
From there, all I have to do is destroy their vital organs, and they'll die just like any other creature.
