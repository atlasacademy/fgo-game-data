Let me be absolutely clear: you were not nearly as powerless or as troublesome as you think.
[k]

＠Rama
You may harbor the goddess of misfortune, but the worst I saw from you amounted to no more than an amusing bit of clumsiness. And that, heh, I consider to be good fortune.
[k]

＠Rama
I think you must have been controlling your bad luck unconsciously, more than you realized.
[k]

＠Rama
You are a great warrior, and a queen who protected her people admirably. Be proud and hold your head high, Lakshmi Bai.
[k]

＠Rama
Or would you prefer I call you Sister-in-Law,[sr]in honor of Alakshmi's power?

It has been an honor to fight alongside the heroes of my childhood bedtime stories.

＠Lakshmi
I suppose I would even say...it was fortunate.

＠Lakshmi
Though I am the avatar of misfortune,[sr]it seems good things may still come my way.

So I'm certain it's possible that you will one day be reunited with the one you love as well. I pray that day comes. Farewell.

Now that I'm about to meet my end in this place...

...I need you to answer the question I've been putting off until now.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
Was there meaning in us fighting alongside the people of this world against its god?
[k]

？1：...You mean, because they're going to disappear now?
？！

[charaFace A 4]

Yes. I already know my own answer to that question.

Peperoncino knew that our urging them to fight would ultimately lead to their destruction.
[k]

So I can't accept that they're simply going to disappear now that this battle is over.
[k]

＠Lakshmi
Nor do I condone everything we did to reach this point, my own actions included.
[k]

[charaFace A 5]

＠Lakshmi
In that sense...I may even hate you for leading them to this fate.

I was born in this land. I grew up believing in reincarnation.

＠Lakshmi
And so I have no problem rejecting this resolution.

Who cares if they go back to the Pruning Theoretical Phenomenon? Who cares if the Felling Theoretical Phenomenon is resolved? All I know for certain...is that these people's lives aren't going to end here.

There's bound to be a next time for them. There's bound to be! I just know a proper reincarnation is waiting to save all of them!

They'll all be reborn in accordance with their karma, and go on to be even better people in the future.

Besides, my real self might be a hopeless NEET,[sr]but right now, for whatever reason, I'm a god.

How can I put this... It kind of feels like I'm riding the safest car in the whole world?

[k]

＠Ganesha
I'm guessing that's new for this place.
[k]

＠Ganesha
So now, for the first time ever, these people are gonna have to learn to live in a world without any gods in it.
[k]

＠Ganesha
They don't have to pray in hopes it'll save them from being murdered by beasts, but they also won't have paradise coming around every ten days to look forward to.
[k]

＠Ganesha
They've only ever known a world where their god was trying to lead them towards “perfection”...so I think all this new freedom might be a lot for them to deal with.
[k]

＠Ganesha
I mean this whole brand of freedom has a lot of dangers they're not used to, y'know?
[k]

[charaFace G 3]

＠Ganesha
It's like suddenly telling a NEET they're free to do whatever they want and throwing them out on the street.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]

＠Ganesha
There's no right or wrong way for these people to live anymore. Now, they just have to figure out how to exist as best they can.

So as the last god remaining, I feel like it's up to me to keep an eye on them.
