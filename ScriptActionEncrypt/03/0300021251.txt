We loved everything about everyone,[sr]though not in some manic, feverish sense.
[k]

＠
It was a kinder, gentler love,[sr]like the spring sun warming your skin.
[k]

＠
At least, that's how it felt to me.[sr]And yet...
[k]

＠
You threw yourself headfirst into frightfully hot emotions, into feelings so powerful they could and did change you.
[k]

＠
You turned from what a Valkyrie was meant to be.
[k]

＠
Sister.[sr]Oh, Sister.
[k]

＠
Even here, in our Lostbelt...
[k]

＠
...you followed your heart...straight to your death.

After falling for a human, you gave yourself over to love...only to be betrayed and despised.

We were scared.[sr]We were terrified.

The way you died was so...so terrible,[sr]but so beautiful...

＠
It was unbefitting of a Valkyrie,[sr]without valuing heroes' souls over all else.
[k]

＠
Your new heart shone so bright we couldn't[sr]help but fear it even as we were drawn to it.
[k]

But, then again...
