＠Da Vinci
So hey, what do you make of the area so far?
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We've been able to get a handle on it to some degree on our end, but I'd still like to hear your thoughts on it now that you've experienced it for yourselves.

＠Mash
Well, I can see a lot of placid bodies of water around here. They're all covered in lotus flowers, and it's very pretty.
[k]

＠Mash
And there's also plenty of dry land, so we haven't had any problems walking around.
[k]

？1：Basically, it's surprisingly normal.
？2：It's almost strangely peaceful.

Hmm... Well of course, water is essential for living things to survive.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It looks like there are large rivers here too, so it would seem it's just as environmentally stable as China was.

Just as I suspected. A world with a pleasant climate is bound to have people, which also means it's bound to have towns.
[k]

＠Holmes
I just picked up what appears to be one such town in the direction you're headed. I'll send you the coordinates now.
[k]

＠Holmes
Be sure to approach it with the utmost caution.
