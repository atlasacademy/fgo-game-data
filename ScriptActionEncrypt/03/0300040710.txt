That was a feat akin to holding back all the waters of the ocean, or catching a falling star with one's bare hands.

[charaFace F 1]

＠Peperoncino
Just so you know, this is almost all speculation on my part, okay? There's no one around who can prove what really happened.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Peperoncino
Anyway, I don't know exactly when he got all that power, or when this world became estranged from Proper Human History.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
All I know is that it was a long time ago. But I can make an educated guess. It was probably during the Mahabharata.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Something happened right around when the war it depicts came to an end. Something that led to Arjuna acquiring every Divinity in India.

It would certainly make a kind of paradoxical sense, given what we've seen thus far. A feat as extraordinary as remaking the entire world simply wouldn't be possible without an equally extraordinary background.

[charaTalk F]

＠Peperoncino
This is also just speculation, but I think he probably acquired the Divinities in phases.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
In the most plausible explanation I can think of,[sr]he probably started by acquiring Vishnu's power...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...since his closest friend, Krishna,[sr]was one of Vishnu's avatars.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
What's more, Krishna was said to have one of the strongest connections to Vishnu of all his avatars.

You got it, hon. So, if Arjuna somehow got Vishnu's Divinity from Krishna, peacefully or otherwise...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...it stands to reason that it could have laid the groundwork to do the same with the other Divinities.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Vishnu is one of the most powerful gods in all of Indian mythology, after all.
[k]

[charaFace F 7]

＠Peperoncino
I expect he went around hungrily unifying all the other Indian gods in this Lostbelt one by one after that.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Indra... Even Shiva and Brahma were no exception.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
So once he'd absorbed all their Divinities,[sr]he became what he is now...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...an Arjuna with divine power over death and creation, ruler of this Lostbelt and capable of destroying and rebuilding everything alike.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Peperoncino
No... You can't even call him Arjuna anymore. He may have started as Arjuna, but he's something else altogether now.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
That's why he no longer has a shred of the heroic Arjuna's personality.
[k]

＠Peperoncino

[k]

＠Peperoncino
After becoming a Crypter,[sr]I summoned Aśvatthāman to be my Servant.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
After I was assigned this Indian Lostbelt, the first thing I did was make contact with its king, Arjuna.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Once I learned he was basically a god, I spent my first few months here trying to control him as much as I could.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Peperoncino
But after that Foreign God Disciple showed up,[sr]Arjuna suddenly started behaving strangely.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
I guess the Disciple must have managed to sway him over to his side.
[k]

？1：Who is this Foreign God Disciple?
？2：Can you tell us more about what this Disciple is like?
？！

[charaFace F 0]

＠Peperoncino
He's a young man who always wears some sort of Japanese outfit. He calls himself a monk, but he's clearly a failed onmyouji.

[charaFace F 7]

He's very handsome, but he's also thoroughly twisted and just rotten to the core. Definitely not my type.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
If I'd approached him, the odds were better than even that one of us would've ended up dead.
[k]

[charaFace F 8]

＠Peperoncino
And we couldn't have that, right? Seeing how we're both technically on the Foreign God's side and all.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
So I always made sure to keep my distance from him.[sr]I never even got a chance to find out his True Name.

You know how she can cross between Lostbelts as she pleases, right? So I see her every now and then...

...but I haven't gotten a read on her. It's like, she doesn't respect the Foreign God despite being an Alter Ego?
[k]

＠Peperoncino
But anyway, Koyanskaya doesn't[sr]have anything to do with Arjuna.
[k]

[charaFace F 0]

＠Peperoncino
Basically, thanks to the other Alter Ego, the male Disciple, Arjuna started taking a much heavier hand to his world than he ever had before.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
After that, it sounds like they needed more pawns for running errands and such...
[k]

[charaFace F 6]

...so he went and took my contract with Aśvatthāman, all because he just happened to be close by! Ahahaha!

[charaFace F 1]

And just like that, Aśvatthāman was his, and there was nothing I could do! A lot of good being a Crypter did me, right? At that point, all I could do was laugh at how absurd it all was!

[k]

＠Peperoncino
Then, to top all that off, he went and summoned a few more Servants all on his own!

I don't know if he figured out how by studying Aśvatthāman, or if the Disciple told him, but I guess it doesn't matter.

[charaFace F 9]

So I gave up on my responsibilities to grow this world's Tree of Emptiness. I mean, who cares who the king of the world is if you're not alive to see it?

Kirschtaria's probably already figured out that my Lostbelt's a lost cause.

In Daybit's case...I'm not sure. I wish he would show at least a little interest in it, but oh well.

[charaFace F 7]

＠Peperoncino
Oh yes, that's the last thing I need to tell you about.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Arjuna uses his power to destroy and recreate the world over and over, cycling it through periods called yugas.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
I'll spare you the details for now, but while they're similar in some ways to India's original conception of yugas...they ultimately diverge pretty wildly.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
We have a couple of problems. First, he's gradually going through the yugas faster and faster. Then there's one of the things he does as he completes each cycle.

We have already been informed about something along those lines. Namely, the “judgment” Asha told us about.

I can infer what that judgment entails thanks to her telling us it involves everyone dying and coming back to life...
