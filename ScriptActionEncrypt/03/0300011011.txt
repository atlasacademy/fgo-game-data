Their skin is much tougher than any human's, so the only way to cut through them like this is with a very sharp weapon and a truly powerful blow.

Just sit tight. You can make most of it go away by draining the blood and letting it sit in water mixed with salt and herbs for a while.

I'll put the entrails aside, too. If you boil them and keep them in a leather pouch, that can work as a lure for Demonic Beasts.

Well...you know how people used to breed livestock, right? Artificial selection, I think they called it?

＠Patxi
That's how we survived this long, too.
[k]

＠Patxi
The weak were weeded out. The strong and weak were analyzed to see what separated them, and the strong were prized above all else.
[k]

＠Patxi
After we merged with Demonic Beasts, we ate those who were swallowed up by their power, or couldn't handle it, or couldn't ever see themselves going on like this.
[k]

＠Patxi
Next, we fed on the young and sickly,[sr]followed by those who were just straight-up weak.
[k]

＠Patxi
After all that, we stopped just being a combination of Demonic Beast and human, and started being Yaga.
