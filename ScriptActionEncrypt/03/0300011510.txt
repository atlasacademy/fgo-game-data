Kadoc Zemlupus is a member of Team A.

He possesses an exemplary aptitude[sr]for Rayshifting, and I believe[line 2]

＠Kadoc
Besides, Wodime already told you who we are. I'm one of the seven Crypters, and we helped bring about the end of the world.

＠Kadoc
That should be enough for you.

＠Kadoc
You were nothing more than a tool to us[line 2]a device we planned to bring along to help us summon Servants after we'd Rayshifted.
[k]

＠Kadoc
We never cared about your opinions. You were just supposed to keep your mouth shut and help us out however we needed.
[k]

＠Kadoc
So don't bother worrying about infringing on our rights, or what we're like as people. We never bothered to do that for you, after all.

＠Kadoc
We've already made our declaration of war.
[k]

＠Kadoc
Our goal is to grow our Lostbelts and bring[sr]about an end to Proper Human History.

I guess we've already pretty much[sr]taken care of that last bit.

No. A Singularity's just a single point in time. This is a belt. The point when everything changed in this world happened long ago and now it has its own history.
[k]

[charaFace G 4]

＠Kadoc
...It sucks there's no more rock music anymore,[sr]but the Demonic Beast howls can get pretty close.
[k]

？1：Why would you do this?
？！

[charaFace G 0]

＠Kadoc
I don't have to tell you shit.[sr]...But I guess we can talk a bit before I kill you.

You heard me.[sr]There would've been way fewer losses that way.

[charaFace G 9]
＠Kadoc
Hmm, I guess it is a lot to ask.
[k]

[charaFace G 0]
？！

＠Kadoc
We all know what you achieved. Gotta admit, it freakin' sucked to have that be one of the first things we heard about after we woke up.
[k]

＠Kadoc
And now that we know,[sr]I can say this with total certainty:
[k]

＠Kadoc
If it had been me, or even better,[sr]anyone else on Team A, especially Wodime...
[k]

＠Kadoc
...I bet there'd have been way fewer dead.[sr]And we wouldn't have taken a whole damn year, either.

And thanks to that, a ton of people died in the Incineration of Humanity. Congratulations! You racked up the highest casualty count imaginable!

Wodime, Ophelia, Pepe, Daybit...

＠Mash
The fact is, none of you were there.[sr]We all did the best we could under the circumstances.
[k]

＠Mash
We didn't have time to even consider hypotheticals during the year it took us for the Restoration of Humanity.

But I can tell you there is one thing I'M[sr]certain of after what you've said, Kadoc.

That's right.[sr]Not that knowing that's gonna do you much good.

[charaFace G 10]
＠Kadoc
We're Crypters. We're wiping Earth's slate clean[sr]and giving it the gift of true humanity.
[k]

＠Kadoc
That's our goal.

？2：Why would you destroy the world?

[charaFace G 10]
＠Kadoc
We're not destroying the world.[sr]All we're destroying is Proper Human History.

＠Kadoc
Then again, we're all going to pit our Lostbelts against each other too, so I guess those'll be going away as well.
