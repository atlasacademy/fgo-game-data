＠Peperoncino
This world runs on the yuga cycle.[sr]But needless to say, these aren't proper yugas.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
A real Kṛta Yuga, or Satya Yuga depending on who you ask, is supposed to last for forty-eight hundred years.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Then the Tretā Yuga is supposed to last for thirty-six hundred years, the Dvāpara Yuga for twenty-four hundred...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...and the Kali Yuga for twelve hundred.
[k]

[charaFace F 9]

＠Peperoncino
And on top of that, these are in god years, where each one is equivalent to three-hundred and sixty human years.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Suffice to say, we're talking[sr]about a reeeally long cycle.

Whereas in this world, it would seem only the ratios have been preserved, given that each yuga is apparently four, three, two, and one day long, respectively.

＠Peperoncino
That's right. But the people I've talked to here said things weren't always like this.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
It used to be that the yuga cycle lasted for hundreds of years, or maybe even longer.

[charaTalk F]
[charaFace F 9]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]

＠Peperoncino
Right. I'm sure the period where kali would show up had to have been proportionally longer back then...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...but I'd also bet they showed up much less frequently than they do now.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Otherwise, the people here would[sr]have gone extinct long ago.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
But over time, the cycle got shorter and shorter,[sr]and now it only lasts ten days.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
I have to think that drastically shortened cycle is why there are so many more kali now.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
They used to only be let out a bit at a time, but now the floodgates have been opened, so to speak.

[charaFadeout A 0.1]
[wt 0.1]

[charaTalk F]
[charaFace F 0]
[charaFadein F 0.1 1]

＠Peperoncino
Part of it is thanks to that Disciple pouring poison in his ear, like I said earlier...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...and part of it is that the Tree of Emptiness has given him power he didn't have before that lets him do so.
[k]

[charaFace F 7]

＠Peperoncino
Yes, I know that only addresses the how, not the why.[sr]I'm getting to that.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
I think the reason he sped things up so much...is to reach whatever end he has in mind for all this that much faster.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
In short, it looks like he's in a[sr]rush to create his perfect world.
[k]

？1：What do you mean by that...?
？！

[charaFace F 0]

＠Peperoncino
Okay, now I can finally answer the question that's been plaguing all of you:
[k]

＠Peperoncino
What exactly happened earlier?
[k]

＠Peperoncino
The answer...is that it's something unique Arjuna does. Something that isn't meant to happen in a normal yuga.
[k]

[charaFace F 4]

＠Peperoncino
Whenever one of these shortened yuga cycles comes to an end, he purges everything he considers defective and unnecessary from this world.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
He believes that by repeating[sr]that process over and over...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...he'll eventually arrive at a perfect world, devoid of anything it shouldn't have...or, as he thinks of it, evil.

[charaFadein F 0.1 1]

＠Peperoncino
It happens to anyone who's unlucky enough to be killed by a kali, too. That's a sort of disqualifying offense.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Same goes for people who end up as social pariahs, or if Arjuna himself ends up judging you to be flawed.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
When the next yuga rolls around,[sr]they just cease to exist.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
It might sound contradictory, but I think Arjuna adjusts for things like that whenever he remakes the world.

＠Peperoncino
I'm not entirely sure myself, but I can tell you what that blabbermouth Disciple of the Foreign God said.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
He said Arjuna collects every bit of data that makes up the world whenever he blows it away, kind of like a snapshot.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
Then, when it's time to begin a new Kṛta Yuga, he uses that data[line 2]let's call it Snapshot A[line 2]to reassemble the world.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
As he puts everything back together, he removes all the elements he deemed defective and unnecessary...
[k]

＠Peperoncino
...and in the end, he has a new world based on Snapshot A, but reflecting the changes he's made.

He's basically hacking his save data, changing the parameters to suit his preferences before reloading it.

＠Ganesha
Aha... Now I know what genre he's playing, too.[sr]He's into 4X games.
[k]

？1：What're those?
？！

＠Ganesha
A 4X game is a simulation where the player just sets the initial parameters and then the world sort of plays out from there.
[k]

＠Ganesha
And if you're a cheater, if something happens in your sim that you don't like[line 2]say, if an enemy nation takes you by surprise and invades you...
[k]

＠Ganesha
...you save your game, hack your data, and reload...and it's like the enemy nation that was bothering you never existed.
[k]

＠Ganesha
That's the kind of thing we're talking about here, right? Arjuna's just doing that over and over until he wins, right?
[k]

[charaFace C 5]

＠Ganesha
I swear, what's the point of even playing if you're just gonna cheat to win! Death to cheaters, that's what I say!

[charaFace H 24]

＠Da Vinci
If that's true, it sounds like Arjuna isn't remaking the world from scratch every time he resets the cycle then.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Instead, he's basically treating the world like a model, adding new parts and removing old ones.

[charaTalk H]
[charaFace H 24]
[charaFadein H 0.1 1]

＠Da Vinci
Yeah. It seems more likely that everything down to their souls is being saved as data...
[k]

[charaFace H 25]

＠Da Vinci
...and that their memories are being modified when they're put back into the new world.
[k]

[charaFace H 13]

＠Da Vinci
And if that's the case, we're talking about a much smaller-scale feat than creating the entire universe from nothing.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
It's still a big frigging deal, don't get me wrong.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
But if Arjuna's got every Indian Divinity AND support from the Tree of Emptiness, it's theoretically possible.

＠Holmes
Hmm... I'm beginning to see the larger picture.
[k]

＠Holmes
There is something about this Lostbelt that is almost reminiscent of a Singularity.
[k]

＠Holmes
The Russian, Scandinavian, and Chinese Lostbelts we've seen so far were all the result of a world where some definitive event happened in their respective pasts to dramatically change the course of history.
[k]

＠Holmes
But this Indian Lostbelt is still in the middle of its definitive event.
[k]

＠Holmes
Here, its king is continually trying to evolve this world by regularly recreating it with parameters that would be unthinkable in Proper Human History.
[k]

＠Holmes
While he has yet to reach his goal of a perfected world, I suspect the reason this world was pruned...
[k]

＠Holmes
...is that the very act of trying to change it in such a manner was considered a mistake.

[charaFace F 0]

Pulling off a feat that massive takes a lot out of Arjuna, so he isn't able to move around much.

And I don't just mean that long stretch of time at the end of a Kali Yuga when he charges up that Noble Phantasm.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
I'm pretty sure that, unlike most Servants, he doesn't do much of anything the rest of the time either.
[k]

＠Peperoncino
I guess he just doesn't have access to the energy he would need to do more than ride that Vimana of his.
