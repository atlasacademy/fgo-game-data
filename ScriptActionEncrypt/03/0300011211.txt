My deepest wish is that your wounds will soon heal, so that you may reassure your subjects in person.

Not at all, tsar. The Yaga there know of you, and have nothing but respect and admiration for you.

This is thanks entirely to your guards patrolling the land to maintain peace and order. The only problem is that there are not quite enough of them.

And to do that...I must eliminate[sr]all those with evil in their hearts.

I have received a revelation from a god. Though it may be a god from a distant land, it is still very much like the God we know.

This god told me to spread the glory of Russia far and wide, and to condemn those worlds that did not end up like our own.

＠B：Priest
Of course you are, and of course you must not, tsar.[sr]But the time is not yet right for you to awaken.

＠B：Priest
You must let your wounds heal and wait for the day when your eyes will truly open.

＠B：Priest
That will be a day of feasting and celebration.[sr]The day when a new Russia finally blooms.
[k]

＠B：Priest
But for now, you must rest and recuperate.[sr]You must sleep.

＠A：Ivan the Terrible
Yes... Yes... I cannot hear the piano any longer, but... Ah, Macarius... If that is what you say, then that is what I shall do...

＠Priest
Now we no longer need to worry about the Tsar knocking down the Tree of Emptiness. Will this do, O Foreign Priestess?

Heh. I can't tell if she's happy or upset.

＠Priest
Even if I can't understand her language, I should at least learn to read her expressions, or I'll never be able to listen to her confessions.
