H-h-h-how goes the Shadow Borders[r]analysis, Your Imperial Majesty?

＠Qin Shi Huang
What a fascinating device. Truly fascinating.[sr]And yet, it plagues us with so many doubts.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
We understand the principles and its operating structure, but we cannot for the life of us understand why they would make it so small.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
Our engineering could produce something of equal capability, but it would be a gargantuan vessel.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
We can only wonder as to why they would devote[sr]so much effort to making it so very compact.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
The electronics alone are positively maddening.[sr]We feel as if we are dissecting a flea.
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
We can barely remember the last time we[sr]were taxed to our limits as we are now.

I see... Miniaturization, huh.

＠Qin Shi Huang
We can even see where they chose to compromise on performance in exchange for efficiency. Perhaps they were simply starved for resources...?
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
Even if that were so, why would they use silicon of all things? What is wrong with vacuum tubes!?

＠Han Xin
W-w-w-well, um, you just got me thinking. If these people can make electronic devices that small...
[k]

＠Han Xin
...maybe that means they could also build communications devices small enough that they could secret away on their person, too...

...I'll arrange for more guards to be dispatched to the Ankang prison right now.

Do not bother. It is already too late. [bgm BGM_EVENT_80 0.1]We just[sr]received word that hostilities are already underway.

Argh! Just what sort of world[sr]do these people come from?
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
Can you imagine it? Ordinary people talking amongst themselves across vast distances, without relying on us or asking our permission!?
[k]

＠Qin Shi Huang
This could spread Confucianism like wildfire. We would not even be able to stomp it out at its source!

We must wipe them out. Immediately. They are like an airborne disease. We cannot let them bring further taint to the empire!
