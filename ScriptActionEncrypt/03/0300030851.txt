I'm afraid not, given that we are[sr]still no closer to finding Koyanskaya.[bgm BGM_EVENT_81 0.1]

I believed it was possible that she may be the one training these Demonic Beasts, but the evidence is, as yet, inconclusive.

Yeah... I was so sure we would find[sr]Koyanskaya here controlling them...

？1：But she IS the one who brought these creatures here, right?
？2：But they wouldn't be here at all if she hadn't brought them, right?

I believe that is a safe assumption, given the lack of alternate suspects. But we still don't know why she set them free after doing so.

＠Holmes
Take a look at these piles of bones, Ms. Kyrielight. These beasts have been devouring their kin since well before today.
[k]

[charaFace A 0]

＠Holmes
They have been sending the runts of the litter, so to speak, out to hunt, then stealing their magical energy for themselves... As ecologies go, it resembles the Dead Apostles.
[k]

＠Holmes
No ordinary species would depend on such a twisted survival strategy. These beasts had no other choice.
[k]

＠Holmes
They desperately needed to find a way to survive after being completely cut off from their proper habitat.

I don't remember the Jötnar or Krichat' being able to directly convert their prey into magical energy before.
[k]

＠Holmes
They may have been forced to learn that ability to cope with the massive change in environment. Or perhaps Koyanskaya gave it as another form of enhancement.
[k]

[charaFace A 6]

＠Holmes
If that is so, then the larger question remains. Why would she go to all that trouble just to have them fend for themselves now?

I was hoping to find evidence of her motives, but unfortunately, the trail has gone cold once again.

I can only surmise she has her own reasons for traveling between Lostbelts... A formidable foe.

Standing your ground and watching over others is a show of your strength and bravery on its own, boy.[sr]You have nothing to be ashamed of.

Hm? Well, you guys said these things could be brewed into decent booze, right?

I'm not usually one for cutting up monster corpses,[sr]but if there's booze to be found... Is this it?

I see...their secretory glands. Yes, as long as you preserve them properly, I imagine Da Vinci could make whatever is within drinkable.

We certainly did plenty of toxin extraction[sr]in Russia, after all. I must say, though...

Between you and that Servant who drinks everything[sr]in sight, I confess I struggle to understand.

This way, we'll also have a nice souvenir to bring back to the village. Of course, neither Senpai nor I are of drinking age, but that aside...
