＠Holmes
...And there you are.[sr]That is the situation we find ourselves in.
[k]

＠Holmes
Chaldea is under attack by an unknown military force.[sr]All exits have been sealed off, preventing any escape.
[k]

＠Holmes
Goredolf's private soldiers are doing their best to fight the intruders off, but it won't be long now before our adversary claims victory.
[k]

＠Holmes
Our task is quite simple. As we cannot escape outside, we will escape underground.
[k]

＠Holmes
Our adversary has yet to occupy the underground hangar, so that is where we will go. There we will find a shipping container in which we can take shelter.
[k]

＠Holmes
As it happens, I rescued four other staff members along the way and instructed them to head to the hangar as well.
[k]

＠Holmes
I would counsel alacrity. Move now, while the[sr]hallways are still empty of enemy soldiers.
[k]

＠Holmes
Their attention appears to be directed towards the Command Room for the moment, but once they have seen to their business there, it won't be long before they find the underground facilities.

Go around to the Command Room by way of the L2 stairs. That will send you in the opposite direction of those black-garbed soldiers.
[k]

＠Holmes
I expect you will find Ms. Da Vinci inside her workshop, but you will need to make your way through the Command Room regardless.

Once you have met up with her, come straight to the hangar. Regretfully, I will not be able to go with you.

It doesn't look like the soldiers are going to leave the Command Room anytime soon... That is probably what's stopping Da Vinci from leaving.

This is the one thing we can't let them get their hands on. It contains a copy of the graph made up of the data patterns for the Spirit Origins of all the Heroic Spirits you've formed contracts with to date...

In short, it contains your bonds with them.

＠Da Vinci
As long as you have this and Mash with you, you'll be able to summon Heroic Spirits again. Though you WILL need access to a good leyline and a ton of energy to activate it, of course.

Chaldea may not be able to get it up and running right now, but as long as we can make it through this predicament, we should be able to figure something out.

I bet this Spirit Origin graph is what they're looking for, too.

We have no choice but to cut through the Command Room along the way, but I do NOT want to fight in there if we can possibly avoid it.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
As I'm sure you saw for yourselves, something is attacking Chaldeas.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
Ordinarily, Chaldeas should be protected by a powerful force field, making it impossible to touch. I'm still not sure exactly what's going on, but it looks like they've somehow managed to seal Chaldeas away.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
And that means there's a chance that Chaldeas could be physically destroyed. Even a single stray shot or ricochet could damage it.
[k]

＠Da Vinci
We have to avoid that at all costs. If Chaldeas ends up broken, fixing it would be impossible.
[k]

？1：Got it.

＠Da Vinci
That's the spirit. This takes me back to our battle in the Holy Land. ...You've grown so much since then.
