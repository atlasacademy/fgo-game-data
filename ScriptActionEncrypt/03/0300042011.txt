＠God Arjuna
Godly... Yes.[sr]For I am...god.
[k]

＠God Arjuna
I have consumed all other Divinities, and brought them together to become a single, perfect god.

As a truly perfect god, it will be simple for me to trample over you...

＠Karna
Why did you consume the gods in the first place?[sr]What did you want with so much power?
[k]

＠Karna
I am sure you sought to create a just world, but I know that Arjuna would never choose such an inhumane path towards it.
[k]

＠Karna
Someone else must have done so instead. Who?

You need not answer. I know that, too.

＠Karna
The king of the Yadavas, Vāsudeva, was not the same man as the Krishna who was an avatar of Vishnu...yet they shared a name nonetheless.
[k]

＠Karna
On that day, it was not Arjuna, but the dark Krishna inside him who aimed that arrow at me.
[k]

＠Karna
The same is now true for you, isn't it? Deep down, you are not Arjuna, but that dark Krishna, aren't you?

＠Karna
I don't know why it happened, but I can see that your inner qualities were somehow inverted...
[k]

＠Karna
...and what you are now is the result of that avarice taking control and greedily consuming all the other Divinities.
[k]

＠Karna
When I look at you, I do not see a perfect god. Far from it.
[k]

＠Karna
You have been irrevocably altered into a man who is both Arjuna, and not Arjuna. Nothing more.

Oh, no, no, this won't do at all. Calm yourself. To be a perfect god, one must have power above all else.

＠Limbo
You became what you are by following your greed.[sr]It is only right that you continue to do so.
